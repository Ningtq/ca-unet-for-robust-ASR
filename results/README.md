sing Word Error Rate (WER) as the metric. 

**Raw:** Directly feed the original AMI-SDM1 test set into the ASR backend.

**FRCRN / MossformerGAN:** Feed the enhanced speech generated by the respective speech enhancement front-end into the ASR backend. 

**FRCRN / MossformerGAN + OA:** OA is applied to the enhanced speech for post-processing. The results shown in the table are the best outcomes obtained, with the OA coefficient used to achieve these optimal results indicated in parentheses.

**FRCRN / MossformerGAN + CA‑UNet:** The enhanced speech and original speech are fed into CA‑UNet to obtain fused features, which are then input to the ASR backend. Numbers in parentheses indicate the relative WER reduction achieved by the proposed method (CA‑UNet).
