sing Word Error Rate (WER) as the metric. 

**Raw:** Directly feed the original AMI-SDM1 test set into the ASR backend.

**FRCRN / MossformerGAN:** Feed the enhanced speech generated by the respective speech enhancement front-end into the ASR backend. 

**FRCRN / MossformerGAN + OA:** OA is applied to the enhanced speech for post-processing. The results shown in the table are the best outcomes obtained, with the OA coefficient (do not include 0 and 1) used to achieve these optimal results indicated in parentheses.

**FRCRN / MossformerGAN + CA‑UNet:** The enhanced speech and original speech are fed into CA‑UNet to obtain fused features, which are then input to the ASR backend.
