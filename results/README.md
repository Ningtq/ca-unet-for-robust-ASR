sing Word Error Rate (WER) as the metric. Numbers in parentheses indicate the relative WER reduction achieved by the proposed method (CA‑UNet).

**Raw:** Directly feed the original AMI-SDM1 test set into the ASR backend.

**FRCRN / MossformerGAN:** Feed the enhanced speech generated by the respective speech enhancement front-end into the ASR backend.

**CA‑UNet + FRCRN / MossformerGAN:** The enhanced speech and original speech are fed into CA‑UNet to obtain fused features, which are then input to the ASR backend.
