AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0001232_0001522 So, show me what you need to talk about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003404_0003804 Is this...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003804_0004372 Oh, I dropped mine as well. Give it this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0004372_0004550 This is a good start.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0014258_0014411 So that you can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0015240_0015280 BOOM
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0019299_0019342 and
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0020774_0021798 I guess a button makes a bit more sense, because otherwise you don't really know that... Oh, what if I right-click now? What happens then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0021798_0022021 Well no, right, you still have the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0022494_0022568 It's more than you can handle.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0023119_0023309 Like if you want to add more things in the future
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0028511_0029029 I guess that's it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029176_0029382 Strousing sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029382_0029782 more than the speaking characterisation as Steve mentioned.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029782_0030242 Yeah, it's true. You know how to involve the speaking characters. Yeah, it's true. It would be nice to have it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033387_0033423 I-
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033648_0034102 I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034102_0034749 Well, if you get the expectation that someone talks a lot in a certain topic,
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034749_0035495 And then if you click on that topic, you get everything that's in that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035495_0035633 I mean that's still another...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035885_0035950 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0047186_0047257 Like we have to...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048370_0048684 like, I don't know, show the speaker characteristics.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048684_0048784 then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0049626_0050203 But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0050347_0050518 C'est ça ta idée ?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0052255_0052654 Yeah, do something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0053716_0053759 Oh my god
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054234_0054469 I'm guessing I put on some of these.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054629_0054823 Yeah, but you're a cook now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0056192_0056252 single channel.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0064834_0065636 But, well, currently, I mean, you probably, I don't know if you want to have, like, the full transcription and the summary at the same time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0065756_0066343 So maybe you can just choose the same window for transcription and summary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066792_0066942 That's a nice.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066942_0067089 سلام
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067488_0067598 C'est lui ou elle se rendait ?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067598_0067821 Yeah, Joe, I got a big job with this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069530_0069723 Or just, I don't know. But yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069723_0070329 Yeah, that might be changed to contents of the same window. Yeah, yeah. Transcription to some region.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0070453_0070496 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071598_0071661 Well, in different ways.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071661_0071729 we can do it it doesn't
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071903_0072556 No, no, it could be like transcription, summary, like two letters and you just press on one of them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0073967_0074082 Let me see!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0075387_0075484 I don't especially care
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0077778_0077821 좋습니다
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079078_0079370 Yeah, well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079370_0079997 But transcripts, sounds reasonable to have like transcripts, like maybe three alternatives then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079997_0080387 Like full meeting, meeting without disabilities and summaries.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0081037_0081143 Oh, no.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084663_0084719 I guess it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084719_0085603 I mean just to try and I mean for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing. Yeah that's what we need to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086073_0086473 just so see the integration works sort of between the cover
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086888_0087101 So I guess that's what he needs.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088004_0088628 Well, I guess, I mean, that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088628_0088867 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0094981_0095082 Let's do that again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0097561_0097613 Oh
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099449_0099697 Can I tell you what I'm an SPG?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099998_0100130 Oh, um, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0100130_0101160 I basically started browsing a bit, just trying to see if there's anything out there to use.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101288_0101585 Yes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101585_0101685 Never hit files though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101685_0101792 Damn it!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101792_0102458 search query on it. Okay, found a tutorial that inverted search indexing. So you could probably just use that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103281_0103473 Yeah, well, I don't know if it's usable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103473_0103608 I haven't looked at it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103608_0104072 But I found some code from a tutorial about indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104072_0104133 Cool, cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104458_0104529 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0105467_0105681 So you think that's a good thing?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106017_0106053 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106053_0106854 I was a bit worried about when he talked about this with the files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106854_0107249 I mean, how much do we actually need to do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0107249_0107771 extracting things from the XML files and stuff to be able to do the indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110119_0110483 Are you ready in Java? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110616_0110841 I mean you should look at the look at the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0113394_0114347 Yeah, I guess, I mean, it was a good point he had, that like collaborating with a foul thing to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0114347_0114848 I mean if you already started on the stuff, we can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115519_0115636 Should we... I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115829_0115980 meet up and see what we can do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115980_0116747 I mean, I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need, what we know more.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0116747_0116842 sweet sounds yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0121416_0121534 Yeah, it's a started attack.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0122521_0122604 I'll show you your passport.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128171_0128615 But what is it like a window where you have to write it so square?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128615_0128800 or is it just what's behind it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128800_0129035 No, this is not the actual song
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0129035_0129151 such.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0134560_0135831 When you like, is there a open thingy or what did you do to like, how did you figure out that this is mixed in search? Like, is it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144448_0144493 Oh
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144867_0144899 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0149397_0149437 NO!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0152324_0152410 Witch.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0155807_0156044 It's thick.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0156411_0156771 I'll be happy when this course is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0157437_0157493 Peace.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0159344_0159439 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0163914_0163954 I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166080_0166148 BOOM!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166778_0167381 The progress report is June 23rd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0167730_0167888 So...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0169920_0170266 Just looking at my old deadlines.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0170294_0170594 Yeah, I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0172494_0172917 Wasn't like what you have now? Isn't that pretty much... No!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0172917_0173184 Oh, that's that's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0173910_0174620 Nice he done that isn't it? It's actually all these things are next to each other
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175509_0175587 Boom!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175691_0175770 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175770_0175999 That's just so funny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175999_0176266 You should make it acceptable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0179871_0180527 It would be nice to end it up and you can sort of show us a bit, you know, already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0180527_0180987 so we don't have to do all the work again, just figuring out stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0181391_0181684 Just like accessing the corpus and stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0185851_0185928 我們下次再見
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0186513_0186630 Bye!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0187051_0187192 Six? Yeah, this one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0188834_0188902 It's full.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0190341_0190431 necessarily.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0190431_0190658 This is her.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0191051_0191105 front door.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0191630_0191708 this computer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0192242_0192775 I'll let us all in there and we can all go in there. We can look now afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193805_0193935 Into what? The computer room.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193935_0194028 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0195765_0196060 We could photocopy your assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0196589_0196765 So what time do we say bye?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197137_0197220 after doing that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197331_0197709 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199088_0199348 Maybe it doesn't have to be that way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199474_0199554 Sounds like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199554_0199647 Me?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199647_0200193 It should be. Is it really? Well, it's supposed to be. Next week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200193_0200308 Twitch is not working.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200554_0200596 B O O M
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200596_0201020 We have one class at least, when we get a speech perception, we don't have any lectures.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201020_0201252 but I think we're having like all of the classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201252_0201545 I don't think there was a point in it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202017_0202078 I think one of...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202348_0202617 Yeah, it was all really they didn't really know what was going on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202617_0203004 I think the undergraduates had... were of...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204224_0204578 Yeah, we really don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204578_0204860 Last week. You okay? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205048_0205523 Yeah. Um, I guess that's it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205523_0205676 Was there anything else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205676_0206048 Do anyone in the room want to take care of this or should I take care of it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206263_0206578 I don't know, I feel so good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206578_0206731 I can't think basically said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206959_0207489 The same thing as in the comments, if I could use it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0207601_0208075 Can you read that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0208880_0209062 I'm just gonna go like this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0209487_0209690 That was...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210783_0210862 Je l'ai oublié.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210996_0211532 And now we have 7% of the person who's going to get the food.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211532_0211708 I'm going to get you a ticket.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211708_0211786 Eat it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211914_0212391 If you're okay with having me acting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213391_0213503 We're done now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213503_0213747 I'm out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213928_0214081 Is she still here?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0214081_0214159 Kiss you up!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0000358_0000538 Yes!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001320_0001372 Cheers.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001521_0002417 Why don't we just go around and everyone says what they've been doing? Has anyone done anything? No one!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0002417_0002522 I'm sick
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003057_0003385 Well, I've got a browser now, which... whoops.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003385_0003440 All right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005038_0005142 So yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005142_0005935 We've got a browser which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005935_0006681 And then when you go on the menu you can select the summarisation box which pops up and an audio player.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0006879_0007304 Rwy'n credu bod y cyfrifiad yn gweithio hefyd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007304_0007975 and it loads up just the background window, so empty. And so when you start
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007975_0008475 You have to either open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008648_0008707 That make sense?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008861_0009603 The transcription box has got a summarise button which doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0009603_0010391 Now, I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up window with the speaker characterization.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010620_0010958 Either we could do that, you know, when does a pop-up come up?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010958_0011582 Either we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box,
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0011582_0012313 Or we can put an extra few buttons next to the summarize button so that you are actually in the transcription box.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012838 So you click on a button and then it opens whatever that speaker characterisation is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012838_0013481 The problem is the left click is already used because it highlights that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0013662_0014263 that part of speech or whatever that what he's saying the left click highlights it right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014263_0014755 so that you can... I don't know what happens when you double click actually.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014755_0015291 But that would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015291_0015579 I think so yeah when you left click it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015579_0016074 Gallwch, er enghraifft, setio'r marcer yno fel i'r audiodd ddod o'rno, rwy'n credu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016268_0016434 So we can't put it on left again
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016434_0016638 We could put it on a right click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016638_0016875 We could, for example, have a little menu that pops up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0017064_0017669 So right click on it, menu, and you can click on Speed of Characterization.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018003_0018170 That's a good point.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018170_0018296 Oh
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018296_0018364 So, no ice cream.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018512_0019136 Yeah I think you do that but I don't know about you but usually in Windows right click doesn't do anything does it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019136_0019281 It opens a menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019281_0019509 Yeah, that's what nobody does here. Except with my band.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019509_0019685 a bit weird for it to just stop.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019685_0019789 But you don't stop from there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0020464_0020661 Or just, you know, or just the button.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0021828_0022161 Well no, you still have the menu pop up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022303_0022415 Well, oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022415_0022683 It's more obvious isn't it? It's more idiot proof isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022781_0022916 Yeah, that's sad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022916_0023124 That's true, yeah. It's more in tune.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0023440_0023676 I just don't know where's the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0024560_0025014 This one
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0025014_0026007 Actually, what we could do is in that menu as well, we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026135_0026438 like a search for that user? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026438_0026635 Is that going to be useful or too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0027270_0027918 Yeah, so when you right click on it, one option will be give me all your meetings, characterise the speaker.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0028408_0028527 Or is that too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0029777_0029908 Yeah, it's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030101_0030163 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030163_0030404 It would be nice to have it in connection.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031661_0031855 What do you mean? The speaker characterization?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031855_0031976 Oh well, yeah I mean...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032138_0032239 I don't know why that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032239_0032507 I mean, the speaker characterization is a bit like he said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032507_0032731 I mean, it's like a nice thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032731_0033237 We don't, we're not actually sure what the user wants from it, but it's interesting so why not give it to him.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033408_0033513 I think we should do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033513_0033555 I know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035475_0035713 Yeah, I mean that's still another level further.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035713_0035849 I mean we're not in that yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035849_0036132 No, no, no, no. Doesn't pop up the speaker characterization yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036132_0036419 You have to first define what happens when you click on a user.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036933_0037201 So should we try to do a right-click menu then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0038786_0039120 yeah there's a second thing about the topics the topic window
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039120_0039859 You want to somehow be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039955_0040278 So we could do that in a similar way, do it right click as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040278_0040500 So this dot is for Rose
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040963_0041128 So yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0041128_0042077 So we have basically two options of browsing the meetings, is by either searching and opening individual observations
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0042077_0042413 and then we have the interlinking by right-click basically.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0043540_0043601 Double click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0046279_0046699 I don't see there's anything obvious that would be able...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0048635_0049016 Yeah, but then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0049016_0049385 and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050231_0050320 Yeah, I'm actually...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050661_0051319 It's not the end of the world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051319_0051763 Yeah, yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051763_0052198 I'll check what it does on double click at the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052198_0052354 because I think it might do something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052354_0053059 but I really don't see anything obvious there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0053232_0053373 I mean, if you can think of something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0054942_0055367 Um, yeah, another thing...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055367_0055554 Single audio files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055554_0055657 Do we want to use them or not?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056175_0056388 Yeah, those single channel files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056388_0056482 So we want them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056482_0056539 I mean...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056935_0057083 جائت القلوب
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0057083_0057836 We might use them to work with them but do we want to integrate them so that when you browse you can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058138_0058175 Do you though?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058175_0058529 It's not going to make much sense if you listen to it on its own.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058529_0058566 LESS
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0059290_0059432 I'm out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061004_0061410 Yeah, what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that you mentioned?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061410_0061622 Do you think? I think we probably need to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061802_0062025 We need to have a... That's why.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0062025_0062566 I mean I'm very much, I want to have everything customizable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063100_0063186 Would you not know?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063271_0063546 Just leave it. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063546_0063967 But yeah, it depends. I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063967_0064139 And the summary, for example, is typical.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064139_0064653 you open the window, you read through it, you might close it and get straight away.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064653_0064783 That'd be good timing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0066465_0066707 Cheers.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067015_0067093 I'm gonna miss you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067093_0067298 Yeah!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067298_0067356 Oh, that's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067356_0067509 I'm not sure, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067774_0067816 I'm a monster!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067816_0068028 Yeah, you probably can.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068028_0068145 I'm sure. Fair.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068145_0068259 I'm sure you can do anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069193_0069280 I can have a look.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069694_0069876 But yeah, that might be changed to...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074042_0074793 I don't know if people get used to it, I mean when you use Windows, or Linux for that matter, you have a lot of windows open.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074793_0074870 Ben de.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075637_0075770 Yeah, you can minimize it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075770_0075825 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0076972_0077180 Yeah, that's true. Bad. Bad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077312_0077525 Yeah, they're definitely gonna be in the same one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077961_0078225 Yeah, that was the plan for the discharges anyway.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078225_0078273 So...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078405_0078674 Yeah, do you want to do that for some reason?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078674_0078914 put the salaries in the same way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0079024_0079145 Meatreats. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0080411_0080636 Yeah, do you remember that? That kind of makes sense.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0081658_0082025 And finally, the prototype he spoke about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082025_0082238 What kind of prototype could we produce?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082427_0082876 Because I'm just, you know, I go into the lab and I say, what am I going to change today?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082876_0082966 You know?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082966_0083521 And it kind of just, it just develops. I'm not aiming for anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0083521_0083648 Do we want to aim for some height?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084151_0084417 I'm pretty much getting there anyway, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084417_0084676 It's not going to be a lot more work.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0086512_0086575 Mmm, Jack.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0087635_0087724 Now let's see.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090041_0090334 Like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090334_0090526 I don't know if you can reaccess other people's...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091245_0091452 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091452_0091735 I don't know if it's readable at the moment but you can show it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092632_0092884 Alright, well I'll make that readable then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092884_0093251 The directory is my number.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093469_0093781 Well, this is not difficult.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093781_0093953 In all the emails.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093953_0094325 Ndiyo.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094325_0094677 Okay. 04525.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094852_0094906 sick tire
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095076_0095254 5 out of 5.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095493_0095832 And then there's a folder in lssd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095954_0096182 It's called the M Browser.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0096372_0096633 Yes, thank you for meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097137_0097408 No, I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097408_0097519 I've got a goal to serve here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097519_0097586 I love foam.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098653_0098772 Yeah, so that's me doing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098772_0098929 Someone else want to talk about their stuff?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101141_0101294 What were you doing again?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101518_0101603 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103010_0103097 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103097_0103239 We found some poetry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103796_0103892 of making a tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0104071_0104139 Cool, cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105314_0105391 Yeah, that's handy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105647_0105801 So you think it shouldn't be too difficult?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107796_0107929 I don't know what I was saying.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107984_0108254 I have to convert it to some sort of format.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0110673_0111508 I mean you should have a look at the browser code then because they already extract for example transcripts.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0111508_0111638 I'm so AD
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117526_0117565 What does that mean?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117565_0117771 This week's only two days old.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119772_0119940 That was complete rubbish.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119940_0120083 It wasn't that bad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0120083_0120184 She said you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122509_0122961 Well, the browser says I use it now or as...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122961_0124017 It was there when I took it. It uses the NXT search to get the data out of the files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124017_0124283 which I think is odd but I'm not quite sure how it works.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124283_0124371 and don't quite understand it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124736_0125544 To get the data, for example to get summarisation data, you have to search for, I think the IDs or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0126372_0126907 So they don't say, look in that and that folder, but they say search everything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127599_0127915 It does load up quite quickly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127915_0128090 Zayıfım, tansiyonum herife.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128090_0128300 But, you know, but what I said like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128916_0129092 No, this is not the actual search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129092_0129792 This is just when you open, you know, to load the transcript for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129792_0130668 It does an NXT search for the string, I don't know, transcript or text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0131325_0132073 Yeah, so I don't know if you looked at the search query language but it's like a dollar a text.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132517_0132635 And then, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132635_0133008 because every year all of these
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133146_0133367 These files have got an ID.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133367_0133778 and all the transcript files got the string. I don't know what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133778_0134161 words or text or something in it. So it just searches for those files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0135749_0136115 Um, is it? Um, well, it's in the code.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136115_0136646 Just that you define a search object and then you search that string.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136646_0136971 I had to figure out how to do the same thing for the summer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136971_0137045 I'm gonna go get some.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137199_0137656 Oh, I see. Had to understand how to do the transcript, how they did the transcript to do the song.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137932_0138302 Yeah, just search for a specific strain.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0138539_0139209 So you could just, you know, you could use that when you, if you want to take the data out. Fish the data out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0139668_0140326 If you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140326_0140557 you know, whatever you want to do then just send me an email.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140684_0140767 I can explain it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141071_0141221 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141221_0141861 actually in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the browsers that i used from this from you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141861_0142167 that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142167_0142569 And I haven't dared to throw out all the functions I have. Disengagement.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142569_0142648 That doesn't sound right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142891_0143171 So they're all in there still.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143171_0143597 A lot of rubbish but it will be chucked down by the end I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143975_0144143 Yeah, can't get rid of that neck.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145448_0145854 Damn, to be honest with you that is a bit long and short.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145854_0146061 The weekend is still four days off.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0146751_0146953 She had that much to do with it, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0147125_0147573 Explore and other things.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148033_0148494 I can't remember what I'm supposed to do by the way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148494_0148752 Am I supposed to do the summarization thingy-bop?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0149932_0150211 You do. Oh, really? Yes, I will get it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150211_0150300 Well, I'll do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150440_0150541 What is that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150541_0150591 BOOM
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150701_0150793 Well, if you want to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151237_0151324 I shouldn't be doing it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151324_0151360 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152113_0152802 Well I'm doing communications, which I had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152802_0153029 That's in two weeks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153288_0153740 Yeah, it's a... How would you like to draw? 9, 10 or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153901_0154781 And then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well, and that was in Friday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155035_0155705 I'm not doing any back.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155705_0155763 BITCH
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159233_0159403 Yeah, if you like.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159403_0159664 We can decide then. Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159741_0159994 So, what are you planning to do over the weekend then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160140_0160327 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160327_0160522 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0163891_0164297 It's just that I think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164485_0164537 You know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164782_0164907 We saw it. Behind schedule.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0166146_0166411 What would you say I'm not very much of a worker?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0167893_0168151 Well, how about we get it done by then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168151_0168188 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168444_0168972 then we can write about it in the interim report. Yes. You know, now we've got something to show.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0170421_0170824 Oh, and the search interface.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171085_0171814 Maybe you should decide pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171814_0172395 And then if you want you can give that to me and I'll build you a nice few dick boxes and drop down menus.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173031_0173365 Oh that's... that's so... that doesn't exist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173365_0173753 That's completely cut and pasted.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173753_0173939 That does not exist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173939_0174331 Nice and done, man. That's funny. That's it, I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0174331_0175377 It's actually all these things that are nicked from, you know, all these drop-down menus and tick boxes are nicked from Google.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175377_0175487 screenshot google
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175679_0176358 That's not a good way to end a rebrand. Maybe you should make it exist then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176358_0176565 It's gonna be a little difficult, more difficult.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176565_0177317 Yeah, I mean, I was going to, but, you know, the whole drop-down menus and stuff, what we want to search for is not quite agreed on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177317_0177653 We never agreed on what we were going to be able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177980_0178441 Yeah, I do want to, you know, just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0178441_0178929 and then we could discuss at next meeting which options we really want to include.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0179135_0179603 I would probably involve researching the Query Language a bit as well to see what that can do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0181211_0181306 No already, what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183053_0183130 Yeah, so do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183247_0183443 show you the code.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0184062_0184390 Ha ha ha!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0184390_0184885 I'm
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0185631_0185865 Yeah, I thought it was going to take an hour. Yeah, I know, exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0185987_0186047 Something like that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186274_0186440 Pick a time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186440_0186706 만렙이다
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186866_0187030 Monday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0187030_0187079 46
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188099_0188231 Three o'clock.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188231_0188316 I should...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188886_0189228 Unless you want to do it after. Yeah, that's an option.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0189327_0189368 day after day.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0190375_0190467 necessarily.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0191393_0191513 We can get in 3D
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0191862_0191980 I'm not a fan either.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0195773_0195858 Oh, that's a good quickie.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196080_0196423 I'm sorry, my computer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196423_0196524 Well, the comments, I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196807_0196960 I just think it's better to do it afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196960_0197135 than we have all the time in the world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0197135_0197413 after doing that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198623_0198860 Actually, it's not even confirmed yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198860_0199278 Was? She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199278_0199452 Maybe it doesn't happen at all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199758_0199815 Is it raining?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200409_0200538 I don't think we have a rating right now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200538_0200603 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0201280_0201698 There's not a point in it. I don't think there was an official one last semester.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0201698_0201870 I think it was just that back on there, wasn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0204855_0204937 That's for Monday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0211713_0211898 So you need to be a playbox, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0213148_0213262 순차기전
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0000037_0000174 I wonder how much of the music
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0000540_0000872 No, really, stop. Welcome to Starbucks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0001498_0001562 トミックさん 全然いかにしようもんね
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0001907_0002369 Did you just paint the Elytra?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0002779_0002990 I'm sorry!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0004152_0004342 Give it a shot.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0010638_0010662 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0013878_0014055 The left click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0016945_0017081 Yeah, well we can't get that for a second.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0017692_0017968 What else can we have in the menu?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0018302_0018699 Otherwise you just have a right click on it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019008_0019065 Is it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019231_0019324 ومانو يلحق
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019324_0019405 Der ist von der Uni da.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019405_0019811 Mae'n ddiddorol i ni ddechrau'r pethau hynny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022078_0022149 Can you swamp up that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022508_0022651 It's more idiot proof isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022651_0023204 it's got a button. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. It's more intrusive. But then it's not as extensible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0023462_0023539 I don't know where is he?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0023928_0024337 Well, I guess in Meeting Browser 1.1.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0024337_0025195 you can have a menu instead of a bathroom.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0026762_0026807 I guess.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0026807_0027289 So what do you, part of the menu that comes down is, give me all your meetings?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028606_0028670 O que é isso aí?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028670_0028789 3일?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028789_0028885 Yeah, you just want a pillow.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0033274_0033321 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0035954_0035986 BOOM
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0036443_0036813 With the speaker characterization for this, because we'll be crossing over the house.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0036813_0037031 So should we try it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0037598_0037628 Well...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0037812_0037941 Even if it is one big company.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0040143_0040498 So this dot is for...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0040691_0040809 on the speaker.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0041033_0041181 Yeah. So we have...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0046952_0047016 What was that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0047016_0047116 I think I understand.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0047116_0047168 Do you really not?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0047821_0048342 Oh, so it figures out what's the most common use of the WP.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0050456_0050574 It's not touching it, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0050574_0050717 I'll go away
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0050717_0050901 Stop covering up! I'm gonna close it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0051364_0051484 Yeah, he has.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0051484_0051863 I'll check what's going on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0055863_0056045 We don't know yet do we, Davey?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0056045_0056157 You mean, single channel?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0056580_0057088 Probably not, but we might need them for the disfluencies. If we try to look in audio.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057088_0057255 We might use them at the moment, though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057255_0057500 to work with them but do we want to intervene?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057791_0058099 You might want to be able to say, oh just give me what that person's saying.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058505_0058736 Unless you can't hear it properly or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058736_0058939 Somebody's talking over somebody else or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058939_0058979 Buh-bye.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0059095_0059365 We'll just say no for now and put it in later on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0059365_0059398 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0059679_0060216 Yeah, because otherwise it will increase the amount of data being applied worldwide. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0060216_0060330 This will prove it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0064717_0064841 I think it's fine.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0064862_0064969 Well, couldn't we have?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0066914_0066991 Yeah, it sounds like it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0066991_0067105 Sind sie mischt
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067517_0067620 Does anybody else have to do that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067620_0067699 Can you do that in choreo?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067699_0067902 I don't think Java knows how to do this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067902_0068026 Maybe, he probably can.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068026_0068178 I'm sure. Fair.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068294_0068404 It's very rewarding, Dave.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068404_0068460 A la prochaine !
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068460_0068785 It's a bit of a cripple, Jarvis with no in-tool kit.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068785_0069057 Mae'r eidd yn dweud wrthiol, mae'n ddiddorol.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0070178_0070244 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0072615_0073007 That would reduce the number of windows we needed wouldn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073007_0073095 Cię spojrzę.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073095_0073445 So otherwise, Photoshop has a lot of windows. If you ever use Photoshop, it's got loads
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073445_0073665 and you're always good forever going I'll get out the way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073665_0073815 There's always stuff in the way, isn't there?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0074777_0074938 Intellimation
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0075352_0075888 Unless, can you, I don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that? Yeah, you can minimise them. Can you do that? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0075888_0076047 Okay, well that's a lot of you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0076088_0076284 Of course you can. Like a lot of people.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0080687_0080793 Yes, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0085470_0085653 Yeah, that's what we need.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0085653_0085983 Something just slightly more than just that on the side so we can plug it in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0086536_0086642 Jack, definitely.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087094_0087314 I think that's kind of what he meant as well, isn't it? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087314_0087615 seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087802_0087921 and prototype of the Giri.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0088642_0088721 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0090504_0090785 You can make it world readable then anybody can see.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0091683_0091941 I think by default they are. No, they're not world readable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0091941_0092409 They're not there, they're only the film. Then only you can read them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0092409_0092544 You can see them but you can't see them.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0094000_0094135 Your number.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0095296_0095388 And then it's...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0095883_0095940 на сестру.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096253_0096476 The M browser.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096603_0096861 I hope you never have to look in my periptery again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096861_0096996 It's just pure chaos.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096996_0098011 Non, je stream et je regarde !
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0098011_0098236 Files everywhere.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0099194_0099473 Toyunca avalanmıştım.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0101383_0101731 All those virgin smiles. You ready to buy all the stuff?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0103100_0103274 Hey, found some playthrough.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0103274_0103343 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104086_0104146 Cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104146_0104463 So even if it doesn't work, you can jiggle your pipe around and make it work.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104463_0104502 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104833_0104923 Yeah, yeah. Messing around.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104923_0104999 Das ist ja ein Monster!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104999_0105058 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0105058_0105219 bare basics is the idea as a kid.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0108343_0108907 I've been trying to write something to read the XML and get rid of it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0108907_0109230 And I can get rid of it, but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0109230_0110041 So it'll come up on the screen. At the moment I haven't managed to put it into effect or whatever in Java to play with it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0110041_0110272 but yes are you ready in Java?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0110272_0110361 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0111440_0111661 Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112175_0112406 Oh yeah, I will.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112406_0112504 There's something musical.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112504_0113049 I'm sure I'm making a mega bit.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114572_0114667 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114667_0114752 I'm sitting here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114890_0115025 should share as much as possible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0116729_0116852 next week
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0116852_0117355 I haven't done anything this week because this week has been mad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0117355_0118027 Yes, exactly. I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whoever it was last week didn't sleep.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118027_0118367 The week as is rather than the proper week, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118367_0118669 I've been getting a little bit manic the last couple of days.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118821_0118966 Yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118966_0119388 And then we had to do an IRP, whatever it was, last week as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0119388_0119603 Which is only a page long but it's quite difficult to draw a page.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0119796_0120427 So that was complete rubbish. It was, it wasn't, but it was. I had to sit there and think about it for a bit.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0120427_0120774 Ja, wat is het Perelvich? Ja, dat is Perelvich.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0124483_0124642 Ça va aller. Bonne année.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125645_0125768 That's creepy as hell isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125768_0125866 I guess that's how it was.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125951 God damn it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0126161_0126273 That is pretty bizarre.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0126718_0126828 Yay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0127051_0127129 Nice person.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0130698_0131380 four and it just has an open variable transcript, whatever, find everything that's got that and then load.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0132084_0132683 Yeah, because that's the guy who declares a variable doesn't know anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137198_0137323 Oh, I see.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137664_0137928 So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it? Is that what you did?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0139133_0139328 I was just thinking that, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0140885_0141114 Have you annotated your code? Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0141114_0141347 Ashley in the moment is gone.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142482_0142647 Ok, je vous laisse.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142647_0142936 mission critical yes so that's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0143627_0144045 commenting it out one bit at a time and finding it...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0144045_0144630 You can go to that next.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0144630_0144709 可以吃了
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0145209_0145714 So basically we go and kind this wet. Yeah, that's the trick.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0145714_0145806 I'm loving the show.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0146177_0146599 I'm still at the bottom of the mountain.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0146991_0148409 Well, should you want to explore any other... How's your quantifier raising?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0150042_0150192 You saw it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0151690_0152141 So what courses should I have picked and we're not doing any good?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0153784_0153900 Ah, it's fastened, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0156158_0156528 I'll be happy when this week is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0167535_0167757 So what, it's like two weeks?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0168279_0168401 必須啊
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0174055_0174256 That's his funny presidency.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0175667_0176204 That's not a very bad idea. It's just a little bit of fun. You should make it exist then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0177660_0177739 No jest nożyce.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0182306_0182820 can take a search tutorial. The class paths, all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0183594_0183865 Next week's High School.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0187312_0187486 Na ja, das stimmt.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188355_0188627 Three is alright
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188627_0188749 It was one time today and I'll do it again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188749_0188825 forward lens.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189592_0189678 Greyskid da i re.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189678_0189903 But we have a good fit, wow.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189903_0190011 I'm not sure what to expect.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0190469_0191133 3.30 in the computer room in here. Can you get in the front door?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191133_0191290 Oh, you haven't got a key, do you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191290_0191374 Can I have a go?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191580_0192089 There's computer rooms in here, the MSC computer room. I've not found that yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192089_0192700 Well if you find me, I'll show you where, I'll let us all in there and we can all go in there. Look at now afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192700_0192791 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192791_0192913 You do need to have a key for it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192913_0192972 Das ist das Training.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192972_0193082 It's got to knock the whole bat
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0193221_0193326 Yeah, somebody at the quick show's asking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194037_0194480 It's only got this crap, it's only got about four or five computers in, but it would do quite good for our job.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194480_0194796 because in Kenose area it's not very open on the immediate road.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194976_0195055 Yes, we can.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195055_0195472 And there's a photocopier. With the code on it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195472_0195877 Let's go there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197101_0197132 Alright.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197316_0197367 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0198132_0198470 Hopefully it's not that man's, it won't matter.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202080_0202399 Some classes did and some classes didn't.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202399_0202522 I'm gonna be hard
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202522_0202670 They didn't really know what was going on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0203437_0203591 Like a what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0206074_0206171 Okay, wait just a second.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209644_0209866 Yeah, I think the comments are basically the same as what you said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209866_0209900 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212177_0212273 Pazartesi.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212600_0212704 Sunny off, innit?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212704_0212767 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0000096_0000665 I wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002147_0002311 I'm not!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002707_0002820 Sounds like you've done something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0019845_0020242 Did you just have the same sort of video throughout? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023050_0023188 But then it's not as expensive.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023188_0023463 Like if we want to add more things in the future, then we need buttons.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023463_0023492 I'm done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023492_0023804 Where's the menu? I think it's more flexible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023804_0024042 Well, I guess...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024287_0024381 What? You can have it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024381_0024516 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024516_0024746 That's funny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030336_0030633 Yeah, but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030633_0030899 I mean speaker characterization, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030899_0031139 Just some way to sort of leverage that information.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031139_0031547 like we have it, we're doing it, but how does it help the browsing?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031547_0031789 or what can it give us?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0036844_0036914 I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037629_0037844 such a strong wing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037844_0038530 Is that from any particular window? Like if we want to sort of get, like if we're on the users versus like a topic or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0038530_0038786 have a right platform for these various things.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0039767_0039903 Right. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040228_0040305 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040426_0040582 Listen through all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040582_0040671 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042611_0042816 Actually, yeah, like another common thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042816_0043260 We have it set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043260_0043622 I mean that's kind of a typical kind of action. Double click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043622_0044106 If you double click on a particular topic or something that goes to sort of like a default view.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044106_0044434 So it will be like all the cases of that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044434_0044882 Either, whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044882_0045291 and just show up the particular instances of that topic in the meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045291_0045449 Like, I'm just thinking to have the default there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045449_0045889 So if somebody knows exactly what they want to do, we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045889_0046271 So the double click will do that instead of the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0046605_0046933 Well, it might come to us. We'll start playing with it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047144_0047355 Like we have the right click menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047355_0047814 Yeah, right click but instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047814_0048253 I agree, it will be a treasure hunt.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050686_0050787 Stop coming!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050787_0050871 How did I make closet?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050901_0051245 It's not, it's not a little...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0056935_0057122 That's a knockdown.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0061525_0062063 I think we probably need that though to have the full flexibility we need to have. That's what I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0062635_0063079 Well, the thing is typically though, is someone going to have five windows open at the same time. Probably not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0063079_0063650 Probably just two or three of whatever they're looking for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0064658_0064727 That'd be good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066363_0066473 It's like having a tan up there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066473_0066660 I don't understand.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0067707_0067992 I don't think Java knows how to do this. Maybe. Probably.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0070776_0071251 Yeah, or even just have buttons on it, toggle buttons or something on the toolbar for that window.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071444_0071496 It's not fair.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071604_0071899 There's a lot of different ways we can do it. It doesn't have to be a tab or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071899_0072058 No, no, it could be like...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072507_0072576 for check marks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072576_0072925 you can have two or a GC number of windows.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0073677_0073785 There's always stuff in the way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0075628_0075840 Yeah, you can, minimum. Can you do that? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076219_0076581 Like a lot of these can be, like once we get the discluences out then we can, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076581_0077006 transcript without the disfluency transcript with a different discipline. Yeah that's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077006_0077098 Some of this, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077098_0077878 How about all these sort of using the same window until we can identify? Yeah, they're definitely going to be in the same window. And probably mutually...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077878_0077947 I'm a truant.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0080447_0080587 Yeah. You wanna learn that? That kinda makes sense.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082308_0082395 in February.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082870_0083007 You know?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0085854_0085988 and so you can plug it in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089197_0089641 Is the code accessible like the gooey stuff that you've done?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089641_0090010 Like can we just copy the latest stuff out of your directory or something?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090010_0090601 Like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something. Try and just look at something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090732_0091278 If you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, then we know the directory to get in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091362_0091506 I might be. I don't know if it's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091705_0091985 I think by default they are. No, they're not world readable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0092565_0092653 I'm going to have to try.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093261_0093398 or you can just email to us.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093398_0093531 Okay, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093531_0093627 I'm a terrible person.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0096404_0096606 I came for meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101290_0101489 Yes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101489_0101940 We're going to do the final step.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102357_0102731 So you could probably just use that code. Like that was behind the question she asked him earlier.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102731_0103149 you know, reusing code and stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0103286_0103406 Yeah, well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104422_0104524 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104524_0104872 We'll probably still do some other file management equations.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104872_0105003 SRM Solicitor Analysis
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0111840_0111900 ontschreeuwen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0115078_0115204 Mm-hmm, libraries.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0116848_0117033 I'm not going to do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117033_0117172 So you're still...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117172_0117196 and stick
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117363_0117533 Yes, yes, I would like to sing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117533_0118031 I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whatever it was last week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118578_0118835 Well, you're an SPNLP and an SP2, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118835_0118904 I don't get it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118904_0118986 Yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0119724_0119772 Я уйду.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120585_0120701 Yeah, that's fun.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120932_0120956 Oof
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121271_0121856 Yeah, I was thinking the weekend probably. Yeah. Start attacking this seriously. I'm just...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121856_0122358 Hopefully I'll have something by next week that we can try integrating into the GUI.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0122504_0122604 Where else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127378_0127795 What did it say? Wasn't the most efficient?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127795_0128003 I don't quite quite
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0142505_0142623 Der ist in Toilette.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0144017_0144115 I can't do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145397_0145576 Yeah, that's interesting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145873_0145886 Oh
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146004_0146201 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146304_0146826 I'm still at the bottom of the mountain. How many hours is this?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0147120_0147459 to explore another thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0148212_0148293 No!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149554_0149614 Who was it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149880_0150007 You do. Oh really?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150178_0150270 你不讓我聽啊
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150288_0150408 This could be changed.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150408_0150546 Stop!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150546_0150752 I don't know. It doesn't matter.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150752_0150839 If you want to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150839_0151060 Let's just play around with some extra stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0151060_0151220 Herz und Drang. Meine.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153025_0153272 Was that in from Alex? Of course.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153272_0153425 Yeah, it's a...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153425_0153739 I would play digital.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0156246_0156562 I'll be happy when this week is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157002_0157469 I think that's about it then. Anything else we need to discuss?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157652_0158052 Did we want to meet before we talk to Steve next week?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158298_0158434 Well, nevermind.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158434_0159102 We'll probably get some work done over the weekend, so I don't know if after D&LG or something, maybe just have a little quick little update and just...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159414_0159510 We'll meet you guys next time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159510_0159565 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160177_0160605 You're gonna do the search. You're gonna open the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160605_0160782 Kyllä pitää olla.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160782_0161336 I don't know. It'll be still a limited version of the next query.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161336_0161524 F
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161524_0161669 I'll be the whole thing then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161669_0161948 Like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162062_0162239 Actually, most of them just download Macs.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162239_0162386 and this was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0163096_0163352 There's some rain. Topic's changing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0164731_0165115 Yeah, it gets behind schedule pretty quick.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165115_0165239 Like you're saying.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165239_0165581 Actually, do we want to set a date for interim prototyping?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165701_0165820 Specifically, a dick.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0174020_0174401 He is actually older than me
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0175200_0175308 I'm gonna cry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177666_0177789 Nice, juicy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177789_0177962 So, I don't know, maybe the weekend.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0179495_0179561 to see what that means.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181028_0181137 Just like the basics
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181137_0181361 No worry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181742_0182107 Just like all the unseeing the code and just sort of how, just see the basics of what you've done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182107_0182452 We just get a quick look over and just take us through a tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182497_0182770 Or the class paths, all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182770_0183332 I just say, okay, well here's, everything's basically set up. And then just jump right in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183644_0183749 拜託
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183976_0184292 In the morning.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184735_0184862 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184862_0185309 The whole thing is, you know, something like that could happen any time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185309_0185690 Like my schedule is like a class, break, class, break, class.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185690_0185974 I know exactly that's what I'm thinking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185974_0186364 So something like that, and then if I have a class I can run off and do whatever. Pick a time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0186612_0186822 It's Monday, it's Monday my period.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187025_0187110 46?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187237_0187767 Anytime, not at noon or two or four.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187767_0188059 No, in between those, yeah. Like one, or three.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189157_0189286 Yeah, that's an option too.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189286_0189383 and after eating.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189596_0189653 សុនានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានានាន�
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190197 Or 3.30.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190197_0190345 I'm just... yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190345_0190549 Necessarily.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190727_0190876 Actually, we just had this kid in there, though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0191260_0191791 Can none of you get in? Well we can get in through the... through the... There's computer rooms in here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192004_0192373 Have you retaken it? Well if you find me I'll show you where it is. I'll let us all in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192373_0192682 there and we can look at it there. We can look now afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192682_0192781 Tak, tak.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193087_0193279 Just bang on it. Yeah, it's somebody else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193279_0193562 I was asking Steve about that, whether we can get in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193562_0193757 whether he was going to get us access into the park.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193869_0193922 Take a look at your own.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194295_0194371 It would do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194872_0194961 Is there a printer there too?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195394_0195537 Let's go there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195537_0195672 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195774_0196406 We can photocopy our assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0196431_0196575 Well, the comments, I'm thinking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197063_0197125 Ciao a tutti
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197125_0197320 So after you watch tonight.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197879_0198035 As long as Team LG doesn't go late.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199514_0199666 Sounds like me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199840_0199917 Right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199917_0199994 What? It's supposed to be.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199994_0200131 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200785_0200843 But it's pretty scary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200979_0201027 J'ai mal au sang.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0201901_0202026 Super lecker.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202026_0202188 I think one or a couple classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202392_0202622 Well, that was already... They didn't really know what was going on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202622_0202650 I think that's it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202962_0203257 It goes up to the professor whether they did it or not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203257_0203347 Well, I don't feel like it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203347_0203466 Да.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203466_0203610 I can what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203610_0204092 I think DIL will probably have one to make up for missing classes. What?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0204092_0204431 DIL will probably have a crisis.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0206079_0206202 Oh, wait, trust you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0207928_0208146 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ님님님님님님님님님님님님님
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208436_0208731 You really want multiple windows from a single app.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208960_0209241 But most will probably want to go with the faults.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209692_0209717 comment
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209873_0210490 Yeah, exactly, just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210621_0210766 Okay, jetzt kommt's.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210766_0210858 Une très bonne salle.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0002480_0002851 Six. Once.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004285_0004363 続け
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004581_0004696 I was hungry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0006202_0006252 Oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008166_0008661 Very interesting start of the meeting. Yes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008661_0008947 I'm so nervous.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0023120_0024443 Perfectionist.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024443_0024853 And I'm very like... I'm very sleepy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024853_0025092 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0025508_0025538 I'll see you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0026675_0027547 I'll look at it like when my usual working hours are like from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0027547_0029410 I know you're always online. You always make me feel bad. When I go to bed, I'm like, one, you're still online. You never go to bed. You just leave your computer on, maybe. Yeah, you pretend. Always busy. So maybe...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029410_0029595 But I'm never online in the morning.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029595_0030227 So? Yeah. Who decided no on this?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0030764_0031418 Ie, dylw chi eisiau dylw ar y cyfan yna?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0031418_0031794 Was there anything else we wanted
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033101_0033591 Probably when I think about it, when I change my goals and stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033591_0034574 I think one thing that we could probably skip totally is removing things from the audio files.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0034821_0035259 I'm gonna attempt that. No. I don't think so. That's too big.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0037281_0037580 Yeah, but that's definitely one thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0041751_0041938 Like, you have to have a prototype GUI.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0042617_0044950 More or less. Yeah. Plus or minus three days. He doesn't know exactly. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, it's not finished, but... So I've only got six days to do the topic segment. Yes. You don't have any SPNL PSIs, do you?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053678_0053740 Um...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053740_0054016 We should probably- Sorry, we should probably-
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0056905_0057415 to be, I don't know, I think, might, but are things that we have gathered.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057415_0057650 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057650_0058070 I'm a bit hungry for it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058198_0058396 I don't know if this is what I'm saying.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058396_0058593 What we're skipping the audio one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058775_0059373 Just keep it together on the paper. Have you taken any morphine?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059565_0059750 To jest chłodzie.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059750_0059870 Okay, you good?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0060478_0060694 Yeah, we could just make it up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064215_0064651 Yeah, my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064651_0065348 I don't know if we've said anything enough. Maybe I can add a few sentences to one of them.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065842_0065968 This is gonna happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065968_0066281 And also sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066281_0066343 I write down the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066765_0066801 BOOSH
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067581_0067962 well I still like struggling with Java stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067962_0068274 Yeah, but more content.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068274_0068805 I think I was wondering about that is... I haven't looked at it so much before.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068805_0069665 I don't know if you guys know how you could do the, like from the extract words that you did
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0069665_0070203 Like also in extract time stamps or something?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074139_0074374 So now I can just put it in also.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074504_0074606 from the thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074844_0074902 put on the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0075883_0075962 처음 생각했거든요.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0089209_0089625 No, okay, good, no. So it's just when we click.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0090755_0090862 all of them at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0115911_0115974 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0118646_0118718 Oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0121631_0121738 That's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0123724_0123835 Yeah, only pretty girls.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0125288_0125530 Okay, that's not... That's not... It says something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0126896_0127147 We're not really well...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127290_0127571 We're not gonna do much more than just look at the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127716_0128450 the text will be with the differences, because we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna listen to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128644_0128816 This is where I'm doing the audio thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128989_0129377 So I guess just displaying it is the right strategy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0129377_0129503 Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't read it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0130870_0130929 Güzel ses.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131677_0131891 It's probably the best thing to do in Seasworld.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131891_0132149 I don't think it's gonna take long to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0153855_0154032 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0169683_0170405 Maybe sleep.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0170405_0170552 Man...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0171979_0172091 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172091_0172338 Yeah, okay, actually that's a good idea, I'll do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172761_0173069 Stick it together, she'll shine it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0173660_0174199 Anchoring back any things that I thought was wrong.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174199_0174381 We were tainting the eye with water.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174381_0174703 I'm back.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175396_0175540 What the hell?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175540_0175983 I've read like four lines.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175983_0176353 12.30 tomorrow with
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012414 I love the timeline.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0013926_0014135 You see it? Oh shoot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014135_0014222 All the best, friend.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014265_0014294 I'm out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014437_0014850 I'm not sure if we need the outline of the prototype.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014850_0015021 I mean what more we're going to put into that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015441_0015688 Yeah, because that's what we're doing here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015688_0015753 the hole.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025379_0025658 Yeah well, I mean it's up to you if you want to keep going with that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025658_0025799 I'm happy to do some as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025799_0025919 I have lots of time tonight.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026045_0026664 And then I'll send it to you. You can do the file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026664_0026730 我走
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027533_0027852 I know you're always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027852_0028436 It always makes me feel bad because when I go to bed at like 1 you're still online.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028436_0028592 He never got it right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028865_0029045 Yeah, he pretend.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029045_0029133 Always busy!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029133_0029280 You're right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029280_0029409 So maybe...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032386_0032508 Odezmą. Odezmą.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032508_0032636 That's the ritual.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032636_0032810 Oh, this is the one that... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0034547_0034909 That's what I thought as well. I mean, are we actually going to attempt that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035060_0035247 I think so, too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035247_0035573 I think that's going to be, we don't even know how to approach that at the moment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036630_0036715 BOOM!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036715_0036928 Yeah, yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036928_0037935 cover some sort of time warp. So maybe, I mean we should definitely, well we could probably not put it under this heading.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0037935_0038266 but put it under changes since the initial specification.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0038266_0038901 and say, you know, we didn't, we decided the timing was too short.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0039384_0039848 We would prefer to concentrate on the main.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0040496_0041100 And I think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041252_0041505 Or some of these are a bit later or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041758_0041920 might develop prototype
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041920_0042435 We will get to dinner. Yeah. Nightly dinner. Best.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042609_0042719 Yeah, it's more or less.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042719_0042856 Yeah, put it to the kid.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045213_0045428 And you can say, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045428_0046024 We're still aiming for the development to be completely mature.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0047485_0047593 I'm...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048189_0048321 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048321_0048439 I really want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048439_0048678 It's not gonna be difficult
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048678_0049161 at least have all the information pop up that is already in the metadata file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049161_0049366 That's gonna be the one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049366_0049523 So it's definitely going to be something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0050130_0050484 Yeah, they might turn out easier than I thought.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0052660_0052741 Yeah, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053015_0053059 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053774_0054353 We should probably do another responsibility of packages as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0054353_0054961 That's what he hinted that we should also indicate who is responsible for what. For now on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0055764_0056002 what you could put, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0060677_0060763 So, um...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0061496_0061766 Have you managed any further on the search thing?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0062920_0062973 I'll be watching.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0063613_0063708 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0076781_0077134 So, have you made another mBrowser?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0077134_0077273 Is there something that I should know?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078221_0078524 Last Friday night.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078524_0078671 But I've never denied that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079643_0079886 I don't care.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079886_0080250 Weekend is out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0083744_0083850 Sorry, but what?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084213_0084627 At the moment is there a window that comes up?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084627_0084835 Or is that the second result of pain?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084835_0085080 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0085080_0085345 I think we'll be sort of...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090405_0090683 tabs.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090855_0091354 But you want to compare the result, the topic, one topic result with one summary result.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091653_0091831 You want to see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091831_0092168 Especially if you get results for the same meeting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092292_0092417 So it's somewhere in top
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092417_0092558 I kind of like transverse.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093213_0093492 I mean we could order them by meeting for example.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093846_0093986 Reorder by
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093986_0094497 Yeah well I mean if you know that's even the second step the first question is do we want to order them?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0094497_0094659 How do we want to order them in the first place?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0095725_0095842 Yeah, maybe we should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098204_0098433 Yeah, why don't you just, um...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098544_0098638 Color code those.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098797_0099022 the results to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101350_0101436 Never if you...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101561_0101936 If you do it straight from, you know, you get the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101936_0102270 And then there's some if statement saying, just put straight on the, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0102270_0102935 rock bottom level saying if you found a segment then color it, print it, red or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103083_0103179 as opposed to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103884_0103924 Bye.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104204_0104330 trying to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104991_0105085 Cool.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105335_0105452 Yeah, working with an event.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105878_0106013 Oh, oh I see ya.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106358_0106545 I was like, actually
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106955_0107583 Yeah, I mean, at the moment it works with highlighting in the transcript window, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0109010_0109145 What do you mean you need to rework with anyone?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0110572_0111480 Yeah, I mean the whole, what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pain made by night.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111480_0111676 I am not sure when it's going out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111951_0112094 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112214_0112478 I don't know what anyone is called.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112478_0112878 and that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112878_0113350 As I said, if you left click on something, for example, it highlights automatically.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0113350_0113593 So maybe it comes with something of pleasure as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114147_0114464 No, I'm sure there's not pain in it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114635_0114909 I don't know. Text area. Yeah, isn't that what?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114909_0115049 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115049_0115317 Norm and Jackson. Mostly things are called Norm.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115317_0115547 Yeah, why? There's not many, man.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115547_0115719 Night object model.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122144_0122353 why do we want it in xml then?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122353_0122857 I mean I thought we'd just selectively write the XML that we've got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123113_0123303 So as opposed to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123577_0123610 YES
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123720_0124313 Yn unig, ddifrifwch ar gyfer y rhaglenau a'r rhaglenau rydyn ni eisiau.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124313_0124485 At the moment it prints out all of them.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124485_0124910 We'll just put a new flube in it. Yeah. That leaves out some of the printing. Okay. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124910_0125118 Not, not store it at all whatsoever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0125724_0125789 Alright
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129048_0129102 So I guess
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129404_0129617 Yeah, you don't really need to do much more with it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129617_0129694 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0131930_0132233 I don't think it's gonna take long to produce anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0132233_0133122 It's just another... I mean these meetings are not endlessly long, it's just words and to print all of them out, so like to write...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0134416_0135016 You can nearly do it together with the transcription, with the original transcription, have them run parallel.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135186_0135590 So if it's a proper word.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135590_0136024 print it on both paints and if it's not a proper word then print it on your own.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136024_0136232 But I mean, that's fancy, but.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136493_0136570 Yay, barbecue!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137075_0137136 So then...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137251_0138184 The good way of doing it not together is that if someone doesn't want to look at the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138184_0138407 you know, the chop file and you don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138548_0138826 But I mean you can you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138826_0139583 You can write something like, we'll try and do it on the fly and observe if that's going to take too long.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0139583_0140140 if it's going to take too long, well, think about writing it to a file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0140299_0140382 No proste.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0141684_0141738 Alright.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0151881_0152103 That's what programming is all about, I'm afraid.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153323_0153432 The higher people.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153895_0153967 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154087_0154810 Yeah, why don't you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say, you'll have a look at both or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154810_0154970 If you want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154970_0155409 I personally don't want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0155409_0155526 I don't want to do it superficially.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0158643_0158795 Well it has already loaded anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0160386_0160730 So shall we all write a letter or two about future work as well?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0160914_0160996 Ben tecrübeliyim.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161180_0161213 UGH
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161522_0161681 Yeah, well maybe. And some killer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161799_0161936 Actually, yeah, that's not a bad thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0162278_0162642 lose what we've done already and then you know lose a bit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164106_0164193 Something liquid
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164255_0164357 Yeah, maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164930_0165079 continuity.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168333_0168547 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168547_0168840 Anything else you want to talk about?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168840_0169092 I'll have sleep over you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0169365_0169426 burnt out
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0169934_0170046 Maybe asleep.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0170046_0171229 So we're all still writing our summaries, sending them to you, you send it on to them.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0171534_0171616 How kind.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0173065_0173652 and then send it on to us so that we can know it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0174996_0175109 Sounds good. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0175109_0175452 I haven't used my pen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0176567_0176635 Bye.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0013743_0013850 Okay, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0013850_0013946 Let's see how it's going.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0016742_0017526 Yeah, we can find something here. This could be just some... right, let's just... just... describe some... screenshots or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018361_0018535 Yeah, can either have some, we can just ignore that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018535_0018610 Ojej.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019159_0019391 I tutaj jest coś z Sesquencie.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019391_0020010 You can have screenshots by the thing, each one, or have just a bunch of them in one section.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020010_0020078 No co?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020992_0021379 I've written the topic segmentation.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022275_0022355 사랑합니다
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022355_0022375 B R U H
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022984_0023725 I think Spaniela should do it. Perfectionist. That's a good idea.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023859_0023970 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023970_0024180 You're probably gonna tell the girl anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0024180_0024754 I love it!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0026408_0026889 You can do the final recording.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0028261_0028966 You never go down! Just leave your computer on maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0031135_0031257 Ah bah ça va j'y ai...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0035738_0036107 It's a good thing to have to say what we could have done if we had more time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036107_0036226 Good future work thing, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036226_0036472 Stick to the conclusion. Yeah. It's a fun report.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036472_0036842 Should've we had more time? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0037097_0037360 Damn!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038504_0038624 We decided to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038837_0039136 We felt there are more important things to do with our time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0039295_0039468 We were preferred.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041533_0041627 Yeah, that's good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041627_0041784 That's your section.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042375_0042600 Best pho on target or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042801_0043608 Plus or minus three days. He doesn't know exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0044105_0044380 So I've only got six days to do the topic segment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0045439_0045574 We're still aiming for the top.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046016_0046324 It's a piggy character, it's supposed to be done already. Oh really?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046324_0046575 Yeah, two days ago. Um...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047298_0047592 Give me a week and I'll tell you the answer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047900_0048145 Maybe the speaker characterization might get slimmer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0048322_0048580 I really want to do it. We won't disappear now.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049534_0049781 Yeah, we might make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049921_0050095 Oh my god, you don't know my time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050095_0050312 Yeah, they might turn out even better.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050861_0051348 The topic segmentation with LCSEG and textiles is basically done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051348_0051744 It just needs to be done. Tuned? Yeah, tuned.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051744_0052069 Search the parameters base man
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0052069_0052298 Let's see what happens.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0055240_0055341 Yeah, pretty much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0065809_0065877 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0066825_0067239 How about any underlying data for it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067239_0067390 Хм, тебе тіфау.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067390_0067474 That's some killer rhythm.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0068144_0068204 그럼요
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070071_0070141 Easy yet?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070141_0071209 When he pulls up the segments, part of that, one of the attributes, if you do get attributes,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071209_0071456 Okay, Catchy News, it returns a list of attributes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071456_0071927 search through those and then that will tell you what attributes it's got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071927_0072435 and then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard code and say look, get me the time stamps.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0072435_0073145 So you just say, get attribute and put, I think the method's called get attribute. And it's called start time and end time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073145_0073437 Okay. And that will tell you the start times and end times. Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073437_0073534 I think it returns a double
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074447_0074908 Yeah, that's one of the non-right elements.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074908_0075230 So the object is a non-right element, I think.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0075640_0075774 Là c'est ta loi, Léa.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088240_0088442 What happened? You confused me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088442_0088847 Do you have three separate windows for the three separate different types of...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089021_0089334 Okay, not three different? No, no, no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089480_0089529 Nice.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0090204_0090299 or tear out so it's 23.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0091839_0091961 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0113936_0114207 You've got a night text pain or something? No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114207_0114225 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114691_0114955 Text area. Yeah, this is a lot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115139_0115208 Stay safe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115208_0115321 Mostly things are called NO.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115533_0115991 Night object model?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115991_0116432 Night objects model map, that's what they're into.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0117869_0117982 But they, um...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118130_0118569 the removing the dysplenies. Have you done anything with that yet?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118766_0119675 Because I was wondering how we're going to write it back to HTML, I mean XML, if we did the processing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0119829_0119979 writing about Tokyo Samoa.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120575_0120691 It's a blooper?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120820_0120872 Textbook.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121398_0121828 You will very much limit what you can do with it if it's 9x or more from it. That's true, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121828_0122215 There is some bizarre method that puts things back into excellent form.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0123311_0123783 Oh, select what we want, just take bits of the XML and only take certain segments.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124458_0124617 Yeah. Or just put a new flube in it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124617_0124713 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124713_0124801 It's that insane.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124801_0124917 I can't. Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125458_0125580 It says something different there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125580_0125640 Dankeschön.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125789_0125942 and written to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125942_0126120 This makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126120_0126533 But that will mean that you can only do things on... Actually, no, like, you can do things on word level.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126533_0126623 So yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129316_0129464 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129659_0129757 I think it's like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130301_0130473 Would just be a blur of a summary.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130473_0130975 It won't look like, it won't say speaker X says this, speaker Y says that, speaker Z says this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131287_0131598 They will look ugly probably because it will look just black and white.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131598_0131725 Unless you've got a star power.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0132163_0132382 juice anyway it's just another
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133236_0133358 It doesn't on the fly anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133510_0133859 And then it just goes through and says this word equals that imprint.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0134183_0134337 It's the bunch of us that it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136501_0136598 Yeah, you probably could have.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136598_0136789 It's probably less, probably not as difficult.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136789_0136955 You just didn't fatten the code out a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136955_0137127 Yeah. But then...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0138300_0138507 You don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140016_0140051 I
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140051_0140536 They're just beef steaks, I think. They're just beef steaks.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140536_0140696 I was just thinking of the lines in this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0141246_0141295 Plus that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0143934_0144261 Although I'm not hired to be a pro-player, I can take a quick bridge out of it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144261_0144569 Even trying to read it in XML with Java was complicated enough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144569_0145137 I gave up doing that completely. I devoted back to night stuff because it was not too much easier.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145283_0145518 So we can do it with night stuff, too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145518_0145969 I was trying to do it, it was just so complicated.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146180_0146289 I don't believe it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146289_0147004 You have to start defining object models like the night thing and games. All bizarre, weird things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0147004_0147093 So, see you around.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0157867_0157939 That's better, that way.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0158908_0159085 Yeah, it's after it's loaded.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159237_0159400 It's just a for loop really.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159400_0159494 It's really funny.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0160891_0161131 I included the future work in my own section.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0161282_0162274 I just said what I've done so far and what I'm going to do. Yeah, well maybe you could... And some issues. Maybe you could split that up. I'll look into it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162274_0162383 I think the list is...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162560_0162760 Might lose a bit of continuity if you do that there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162760_0162852 else was thinking.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162852_0163194 Sometimes it's easier to have the top in its own intersections if you know what I mean.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163194_0163417 So you talk about sweet characters and sing weird songs.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163985_0164101 goals or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164101_0164355 Bullet points.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164381_0164747 Because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there... Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164747_0165061 If they're not together you lose a lot of continuity I think.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0165202_0165243 BOOM
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0168522_0168675 Anything else?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172742_0172828 used to get together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172828_0172899 She'll shine it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0176443_0176700 Oh, das steht.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178273_0178394 I hope that is alright, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178394_0178659 Ich muss wieder Handy lassen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003903_0003990 いいね
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003990_0004240 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004240_0004381 Hatırlatıyorsun.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004495_0004612 I've changed my mind.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004745_0005954 Actually I guess the first thing I just sort of did was a really sort of brief version of what we have to do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0005954_0006231 Да, я не понимаю, что это за ерунда.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012470_0012730 Actually for that I was just copying the one straight out of the documents.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012730_0013102 So it's all whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0013772_0013822 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014111_0014174 Oh shit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014174_0014244 That's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015004_0015184 Well, just sort of. Well, the thing is, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015184_0015707 We're going to be touching on all that during the other part of the program. Yeah, because that's been what we're doing here, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015707_0015897 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015897_0016426 Well, it's just something that he had mentioned in the previous, like just to sort of have a prototype to go.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016426_0016728 I guess we're just saying that we could potentially do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016728_0016792 et alors vous...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016792_0016898 He's had something there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017730_0017785 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017785_0018043 Like the thing is I was thinking even in the stuff that I was doing I would get
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018043_0018395 just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018395_0018519 Can't hear the hands, we can just ignore that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018519_0018560 最高です
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018560_0018829 Oh yes, actually I had that at the very end of the screenshot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018829_0018936 Put that in chop on the screen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018936_0019111 So, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020934 Anyways, so, um, so yeah, this is just very general structure, um, I guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs, and, I don't know. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021133_0021163 Huh?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021313_0021454 Nice.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021454_0021977 So I don't know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this I could do that before I made one to you guys
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021977_0022293 Otherwise, no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0022293_0022953 Um, did someone else want to throw it together? Actually, I can probably still throw it together if you want. I'll put your parts into this one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023125_0023329 Perfection.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023630_0023745 自己來接
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023745_0024214 Let's just cut out the middle man. Yeah exactly. We're not even going to tell if you've got it wrong anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0024214_0024440 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0027526_0027739 I know you're always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028668_0028943 Just leave your kinky.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028943_0029179 And he pretend, always busy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0029731_0030110 Notice that noise.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030110_0030238 Oh, God.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030488_0030619 So I'll send it off to you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030619_0030654 I'm out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031329_0031464 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031677_0031881 Was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031881_0032249 I mean essentially was what like, um, you can't see it right there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032249_0032460 Bon, je vais filer au revoir.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032460_0032772 Oh, that's the original. Oh, this is the one that...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032772_0033027 Yeah, yeah, it was just copied straight out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0036788_0037258 I think I'm just going to discover some sort of time warp thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0038142_0038232 sophistication
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041160_0041286 That's the smiles.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041286_0041566 Or some of these are a bit later or something. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041566_0041631 الكريم
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042654_0042791 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042881_0042968 through it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042968_0043351 Plus or minus three days. He doesn't have to know exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043351_0043505 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043505_0043786 I mean yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044331_0044624 아, 피에시스?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044624_0045064 You don't have any SPNL PSIs do you?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046238_0046442 Oh really? Yeah, two days ago.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046442_0046502 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046502_0047118 Um, for one of those, something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0047576_0047898 Wait, should we put a hint that something like that might happen into the document?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0048484_0048561 天啊
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049218_0049277 It worked.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049277_0049343 That's natural.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049542_0049639 Okay, that'd make it disappear.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0051551_0051685 tuned? yeah, tuned
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0054984_0055312 Well, I could probably just copy that straight over to the other one as well. Yeah, pretty much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055312_0055519 That's essentially the same as it was.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055519_0055766 More detail specifically.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057504_0057594 Split those apart.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057638_0057891 I'm so yelling, I'm very far away
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057891_0058016 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0058470_0058757 What if we're skipping the audio one? That makes it easier.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059159_0059383 Have you taken the 4-4 count?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059383_0059545 Have you taken any more of a look at it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059545_0059671 I've got this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059852_0059926 We could probably...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060166_0060504 I know people have time to look at that before tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060504_0060724 We could just make it up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060724_0061147 Like I'll claim one, you claim the other for the search things and then we can leave that one as a joint one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061295_0061394 my picking.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061780_0062365 Um, I found, finally, today, something that I can build it in, and it's, uh, I should have something for tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0062365_0063158 I should at least, very least have a GUI and a wire. I'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063158_0063436 I want to get something. I want to see this. I want to get it together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063436_0063952 I have an image in my mind, I just want to see it on the thing and then get my screenshot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065078_0065557 I mean you can write the sentences first as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065557_0065912 I mean with the attention that this has got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065912_0066273 And also sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066273_0066537 I mean, you write down the words and the ideas and stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066537_0066801 You want to do something? Yeah. Of course too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0067941_0067973 Bye!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077159_0077621 something that I should do. There is but I haven't made a lot of changes to it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077621_0077969 so I might just delete what I've done and copy it in from yours.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077969_0078306 Because I'm sure you've probably made some changes already. Well, since you don't...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078306_0078362 Powrót?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078362_0078473 to try it out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078539_0078676 I thought you said... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078676_0078817 Alright, I see you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078856_0079508 I thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were gonna fix those on the webcam or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079508_0079598 No. Oh, okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0079847 Nope.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079969_0080142 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080142_0080966 Yes, if you're all other stuff up there that actually I'm gonna try and minimize the amount of changes that make damn browser anyways
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080966_0081036 Czyta.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081165_0081248 Cię pięknie słyszę.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081248_0081582 Actually, just to clarify, last week when we were talking about our search results,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081582_0082029 Like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082114_0082502 Do we want separate result panes for each of those?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082502_0083092 or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083092_0083471 so that when they click on that it's going to go to the relevant thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083471_0083998 Like just if they check all three, say topics, summary, blah, blah, blah, have three different windows come up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0084148_0084359 Or three, like some, some paintings.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085039_0085733 What do you want to say? I think what we sort of discussed last week was to have it sort of on the same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085733_0086046 So it will be on the search window, the bottom half of the search window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086046_0086485 I don't know if we still want to keep it that way, but that's what I was going to be working on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086485_0086802 So it's just like you click those and just water.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086802_0087255 Yeah, split step thing into two or three or whatever it is. One, two, three, depending on which one you're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087255_0087384 ones a check.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087384_0087866 And so if we want to do it that way, you know, like it probably doesn't matter too much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087866_0088246 Just try and think if there's going to be any other issues down the road, depending on what's going on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0088813_0089409 No, just just pains just result pains. Okay, not three different. No, no, no, no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089409_0089503 C'est bon. Ouais.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089503_0089859 So it's just when we click topics and summaries for what we want to search.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089859_0090212 There will be two result pains.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090212_0090467 What tabs are you talking about? I don't know, really, tabs.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090467_0090932 I like the idea of time. But then you can't see all of them at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0091303_0091783 Well, it's... No, but the thing is if you're looking, if you check them both, you won't see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092178_0092282 Yeah, he was a hard client.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092314_0093320 So the summary and topic and the transcript. Or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0093620_0094088 Oh yeah, I just thought of this other thing, whether we want to have this reorder by... Yeah, well I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094088_0094233 That's how it's done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094233_0094296 Second step.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094729_0094978 I think yeah probably by meeting makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094978_0095288 I mean, essentially they're in time order.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095288_0095598 So, yeah, that kind of makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095767_0095835 You should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096204_0096458 Should be easy. No, I don't think so.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096458_0096585 Should be films, I guess.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0098888_0099364 Sometimes in a case like that, I'd like to run across some in other languages.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099364_0099946 It's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it's put into a list box or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099946_0100175 It's hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100175_0100452 and then if we're highlighting something in the transcript window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100452_0101260 it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a list box, an item in a list box.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101260_0101496 So, thanks.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101496_0101599 Where is it coming from?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103036_0103108 A z'pour les amis !
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103329_0103842 Um, yeah, it's just like from past experience. There's goofy little things that happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103842_0104599 It just doesn't let you say certain things and it's just kind of trying to go to a different window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0104599_0105080 So if you want to go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105080_0105308 At that point, that's where it starts getting a little bit tricky.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105308_0105835 because you're working with an event handler within the one panel or a loose box or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105835_0105890 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106024_0106677 There are ways around it, but you know, we'll be able to figure something out before tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106677_0106952 Or down gets you or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106952_0107083 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107588_0107656 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107851_0108601 I think he was saying that as long as we implement that interface, it should work with anything that we do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108601_0108763 Like highlighting, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108763_0109120 I think that was some... Who was saying that? What do you mean you two work with each other?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109120_0109343 Um, isn't Jonathan saying something about that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109343_0109760 I think it was just like, as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109760_0110058 we should be able to have that highlighting happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110058_0110116 Hmm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110116_0110158 Boom!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0113476_0113968 Maybe I should use that as well anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115367_0115504 What? No, many, many.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115704_0115871 Oh, okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0119968_0120335 I thought we were just going to have that as words
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0120335_0121016 like not as XML just sort of as a... as a block of text. What was that though? Text file. Oh transcript.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121016_0121339 No, because then we need all the other data if we want to keep it a transcript.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121635_0121783 That's true, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121783_0121815 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125252_0125286 Sorry, I had to.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125286_0125531 Okay, that's not... It says something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125531_0125664 نعم
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125664_0125902 That's sort of what we were thinking.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125902_0126033 Actually, this makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0126624_0126989 Yeah, if we're going to do the XML, then fine. That's probably the easiest.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129344_0129433 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129704_0130120 I think it's like, well, how would we display the like, if we do take this fluency, so I'm just, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130120_0130471 create a text file, take the disk and send it to the text file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130967_0131486 Unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file. Yeah, then it will look ugly probably because it will look displeasing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0131568_0131631 Alles schlecht.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140401_0140531 Perfect.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140531_0141101 I was just thinking it's probably been used like XSLT to kind of just transform it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141101_0141775 flip it into a set just transforms on like a style sheet down all right now she
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141775_0142195 And then it's kind of like there's usually things built into, well, it should be built into Java.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142195_0142837 process, Excel, and I can just create whatever file it's going to be in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142837_0143107 It's been a couple years since I've looked at anything like this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143107_0143373 Да, да мы им бенедикт.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143373_0143725 And then that way we could even pre-process that beforehand.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143725_0143963 I don't know, well we don't want to have to do that, right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143963_0144215 Although, I'm not quite as convinced as they could put it up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144532_0144657 I gave up doing that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144657_0144731 Alright, bye.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0145444_0145524 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146551_0146596 Bon allez, c'est parti.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146596_0146733 And yeah, you're serious.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146895_0146946 Nun zum
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147168_0147522 Actually, I was thinking I might try and talk to... Who is it? Jonathan or Gene?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147522_0147857 Like just to see what system they use to develop this stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147857_0148685 It would be nice to have all the tools there and just have the object model and just plug and play with everything and just actually use the system.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148685_0148921 You know, at a higher level rather than kind of, you know...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148921_0149202 Playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and games and that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149202_0149408 I guess we'll just sort of see what they're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149408_0149827 So I'm going to try and contact them and see if there's...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149964_0150225 もう、変質的に言わんし
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150225_0150542 Just to get things, I don't know, moving at a higher level I guess.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150688_0151137 It seems to be more interesting to use it as a real developer would.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151304_0151743 It just seems like a little tinkering here and there and just adding a couple things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151889_0151929 I'm smart.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152034_0152305 No, no, it shouldn't be.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152305_0152397 你皮皮还而我
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152397_0153316 It should be conceptual and coming up with the brilliant ideas and then just bring those to reality.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0153441_0153811 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0155864_0156372 Like the thing that was singular as well, once it's done for one meeting, it's done. It's there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156372_0156430 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156430_0156582 text file or XML or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156582_0157089 Yeah, just... I don't know. It just... It doesn't make any difference really either way to me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157089_0157402 It's like, if it's fast enough on the fly, then sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157402_0157749 That's about the only issue I have with on the fly, whether it's fast enough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157956_0158182 Especially with Java and stuff like that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0158182_0158649 If it's loading a file, processing it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0159496_0159838 What a run out of memory. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161181_0161213 UGH
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161805_0161922 Thank you, guys.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0162054_0162383 Je pense que Twitch...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163146_0163210 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163372_0163537 I think that does make sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163537_0164018 But maybe at the end, maybe just a point for all the things that we're still working on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164018_0164192 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164712_0164801 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0165141_0165226 Hmm.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168112_0168210 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168501_0168596 吃
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171165_0171447 Or she'll just take it, she can take it from there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171447_0171516 Ты знала.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171516_0171724 How come?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171724_0172114 I can get you if you want to see my hand.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172114_0172473 Actually, that's a good idea. I'll take one quick look over.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172473_0172728 try and get it as good as I think that we can.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0173283_0173628 I'm gonna kill you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0174290_0174848 They were changing dialogue back. I love you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0175479_0175581 I'm sorry
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176364_0176543 Oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176882_0177179 That's how you twerk.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0005327_0005656 Did we get a 7 out of 10 for real? Yep.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0010714_0010759 Oh my god!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012507_0012860 I think there is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012860_0014128 Just because the topic box and all this is based on what was it called? Non-night text area or something?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014128_0014333 in Texas, Arizona.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014333_0014626 It has some sort of highlighting stuff there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014626_0014856 So you should probably look at the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0015536_0015731 I'm not sure if it's in-built though, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0016668_0016786 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018250_0018339 You don't. No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018339_0018522 I'm not ready.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018522_0018869 Yeah, I was thinking about it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0019053_0019099 I'm done.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0021698_0021836 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0022987_0023159 Okay, yeah, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023159_0023237 everything but that's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023237_0023267 Hello, what happened?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023520_0024002 So have you already calculated all this data? What are you supposed to do now?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0024002_0024042 pirate
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0026456_0026737 I should have come back to this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0031624_0031695 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0033862_0034307 What the easiest thing to do without anyone in this play?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034307_0034400 Just kidding.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034863_0035710 So, whenever we open a window for one speaker...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036852_0036935 Nie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036935_0037078 Pretty much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0038146_0038190 Oh is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042122_0042347 The one present.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042347_0042747 Although we could do it one highlighted I suppose.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0044963_0045399 I mean that would be implementing what he said.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045399_0045889 that you want to see per topic, you want to see which one spoken most, that sort of thing like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045889_0046420 So you could zap through these topics? Meetings. Oh, meetings, sorry. Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0046420_0047031 and it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that looks more... Yeah, yeah, that would be easier as well, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047031_0047163 Do you want to do that then?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047936_0048004 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0048166_0048640 So yeah, random things like just return talking to her. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0049178_0049243 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055128_0055476 Can you put in there what topic we're speaking about as well? Yeah, yeah, that'll be...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055476_0055829 I could use that for the topic pop-up in the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056075_0056113 But that was...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056541_0056607 That wasn't enough.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0057730_0058078 Because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0058078_0058747 So you have the option of popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060366_0060622 So how would you calculate that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060622_0061042 Would you do the summarisation as you populate it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061042_0061259 What, the glands just come straight off of that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061553_0062005 Alright, so that is all stored together. The speaker class knows about all of that stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062005_0062172 All right. And the mate in class knows about it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062567_0062708 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062708_0063054 So have you done these yet? No, no, but I already did it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063054_0063276 Just gotta decide on what we wanna...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063527_0063800 I thought the other stuff was more important anyway, so I did that first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063948_0064594 So it's all usable now, can I do it tonight? No, design the game first then because...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0066667_0066722 Oh, I see.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067308_0067648 Well let me know when it's sort of usable.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067648_0067710 If you can, if you want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068138_0068232 Would you meet a picture?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068232_0068607 To zmienia... Tak, ale nie będzie to za długo.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068607_0068783 I mean, isn't it? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070272_0070386 Smells good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070386_0070452 So where's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070452_0070695 Is that stored in the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070898_0071135 On your home directory, not in there. Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0071468_0071520 Actually I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0072563_0073206 Well, are you wanting to write that in directly or what do you want to do with that? What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073206_0073320 if you want to change my code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073552_0074028 or lower the saturation. Do you want to change the original embroidery file in?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074028_0074121 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074288_0074356 Have you done that now?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074568_0074831 Oh, okay, so not the actual one, but a copy of it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075146_0075269 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075269_0075311 Hello.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075690_0075818 Well just tell me when.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075818_0076625 because I usually work on my own copy for the day and then update it without checking if the one in the share has changed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0076625_0076783 I'm ready to do this too, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0077208_0077283 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0078579_0078992 So is that what you're working on now then, to present the results nicer?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0079726_0079893 I mean the highlighting stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0081352_0082292 Actually, for an end text area, whatever it is, they define some handy highlights on that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082292_0082443 So you've got different highlights
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082443_0082847 Just look at what they wrote about it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082847_0083407 They've got user highlights, selection highlights, time highlights and...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083564_0083648 So now,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083866_0084550 So you can quite easily, if your text area is called area, you just do area.sethighlights or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084550_0084615 對
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084903_0085417 That's the way I did it, to highlight, to cross highlight between topic and transcripts.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0085647_0085685 Suck it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091133_0091466 but if you don't know what it says, I can't
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091466_0092196 I've got all this space, you can use some. Otherwise the guy's all new.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092196_0092783 Has it talked to you now? Has it? It's a nice machine, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092912_0093190 I've spent too much time on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093287_0093764 I've been doing some random pop-up windows for the speaker characterization, which is good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093764_0093949 so fill that in now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093949_0094239 The windows are all there now after lots of moving.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094447_0094830 Well, you know, just a pop-up. A pop-up. It was difficult enough.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094830_0095852 Because it basically has to set up 10 pop-up windows in memory, as in already initialized them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0095852_0097625 because there might be 10 speakers, and they all have to have different windows. And I'm working on, when you click on a topic to see a list of the topics, of the meetings that topic was mentioned in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0097625_0098398 And I have a question about the... you said we wanted a start screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098398_0098686 what kind of starts we're ending on.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098686_0099910 I mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser or something? It's an LSD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0099910_0100194 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0101016_0101819 So do we want... yeah, maybe we could write on like the... whatever it's called, the top of the window saying, welcome to the Meet Your Browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0102824_0103036 Yeah, how?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103036_0103596 I mean at the moment the way it is it's a drop-down menu as you see.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103596_0104380 with all the... and that because it's the dialogue class that you use there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105197_0105814 I mean, I think they should have two options. Either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105814_0106146 and through that, once you've got the results, you click on something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106641_0106681 Evet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106846_0106986 The only thing that's such is a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0109093_0109356 Can you not get this num object?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0110808_0111239 I suppose we wouldn't want to use NXT at the beginning anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111239_0111597 because we don't want to search locally. We want to search locally.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111597_0111799 Namaste.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112036_0112390 If they wanted to, then they would open the meeting first, right? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112390_0113079 So let's say they have two options, either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0114980_0115106 But why do we want default?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0115106_0115222 I mean, just-
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117710_0117866 Yeah, but local switch. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117866_0118149 We can't do levels without trying.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118149_0118201 I'm back on track
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118903_0119072 Except for getting any useful tips.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0119572_0120392 But yeah, the global inverted falset gives the non-objects basically to the local search, right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0120772_0120979 Well yeah, that's always going to be the case with search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0127554_0128257 I mean you can, you know, the option is to do a search in the way that, if you do a global search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128257_0128525 First step, only return the meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128525_0129236 As in, not even meetings, but the name of the meetings. So, you know, say you want to search for the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129236_0129671 then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129671_0130137 and then you can decide, well I want to search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0131846_0131917 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0133484_0134502 There is, yes, in one of the papers they have names. Oh, do they? Like the work of the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0134502_0135159 Even better understanding isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135159_0135296 That's a working group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135328_0135540 Okay, I love that one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136130_0136376 So I've put that in already too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136513_0136562 Score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136797_0137361 So yeah, again, concretely to the startup, startup, whatever it is, we know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0138687_0138799 What? You're actually in the game?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139654_0139748 Yeah, how is that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139748_0140090 I mean, do you think you would have time for that as well?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0143830_0144030 It would have been like a list of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0146883_0147426 So the general score would that be for the whole of the language?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0147621_0147931 I'm a trumpet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148152_0148272 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148571_0149086 So what would the, if we had these face topics, what would they look like? A bunch of keywords.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149086_0149296 Bunch. That's what it means.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149296_0149507 Just a list of keywords or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0150892_0151721 Because that would be really handy then, we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151721_0151946 Because if you just have the segmentation, that's great.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151946_0152612 but we can't compare it to the hand annotated, you know, hand segmented.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154848_0154929 You're not alone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154929_0155000 career in us.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0157347_0157497 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158504_0158755 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too. Do we need to?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158755_0158866 Reduce blood pressure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158866_0158946 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159488_0159909 Sort of, but then the main idea was more like to speed it up, speed the search up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159909_0160355 I guess NXT, the whole of the covers was just not for you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160355_0160440 That works like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160737_0161085 David, the general inverted vowel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161085_0161177 It still uses it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161177_0161402 It ranks the results by the amount of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161402_0161533 That would just be a nice extra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161826_0162209 Yeah, I wasn't sure. I don't think we have that in the document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162322_0162464 Ha ha ha ha ha
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162464_0162631 So what? It's only interim.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163367_0163566 Yeah, I mean, if you have time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163566_0163798 Because I'm only going to do this if I've got time anyway, so...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163798_0164155 because then it would give you, if you search for work
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164155_0164659 it will give you the meetings but also how often that word occurred in that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164659_0164887 That would be so useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164944_0164998 뭐야 뭐 그런게
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0165287_0165337 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166254_0166691 Yeah, but it's useful. How informative, that TFIDF is an informative score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166691_0167133 If you search for language and you return like, you know...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0167133_0167654 basically all of the meetings. You want to see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169068_0169150 language and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169607_0169964 It's like Edinburgh and Cambridge
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171103_0171347 And then add those apples.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171347_0171413 Because of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171413_0171547 The thing is that you can't...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0184287_0185068 So, to come back and start off screen... Oh, okay! It's sort of disturbing. I'm very unsure about what that should look like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185068_0185739 I mean, we want it for the part where you can choose the meeting, what kind of information you want to have about the meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185739_0186339 I mean the longer name, obviously, if there is one, because they don't all have one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186339_0186624 What, the users that spoke?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186624_0186781 Use the other part? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186781_0187146 Then that's pretty much the same for the same group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187463_0187523 I said
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187875_0188443 Yeah, just to give them an idea, a general idea of what there is, so they can pick a topic.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190217_0190360 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190360_0191168 Rwy'n bythau i weld y cyfarfod lle sônodd Sonset o rai rhaglenau ymchwil.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191168_0191313 I want that first meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191313_0191358 너무 컸다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193761_0193944 Keep it more general.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193944_0194339 Because we just want to have a way of, you know...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0194339_0195069 Because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting, they can browse through that quite nicely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0196708_0196761 What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197378_0197509 or how are we going to know that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197755_0197983 They can have a site
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198418_0198689 But that would defy the whole point of browsing, right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198689_0198979 If you only wanted to look at the top. Well, alright, call it favourites then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198979_0199684 Yeah. You can have a favourite now. Just scroll down the list and find your favourite one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0199684_0200295 Yes, I love it. It's not like they come back every day and do the same browsing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0200295_0200898 That's what's true. I forgot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0201511_0201565 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0203619_0203867 So we can, you know, sort of fuck it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0204433_0204785 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205023_0205757 I wasn't going to put any help in there, any sort of explanation of how the browser works to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205757_0205864 Dobra, co teraz?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207091_0207139 I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207616_0207937 But I mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208152_0208271 Yeah, well, search, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208271_0208431 Even if it just had two things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0209821_0210117 Yeah, that all happens through the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210117_0210615 Basically either the user knows which meeting he wants to look at, he just clicks on it,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210615_0211023 Or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213265_0213415 Oh, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213415_0213551 inside the sedge bin, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0215327_0215467 Yeah, that's what...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216096_0216266 Yeah, that one's about right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216266_0216811 Ond dwi ddim yn siŵr am sut i roi'r holl wybodaeth yno.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216811_0217577 Drop down menu, but we want all the information about the name, the longer name, the users.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217577_0217646 Well, we don't do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217863_0218569 Maybe if they know the codes in other corpses too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0219105_0219240 Drop down as a knock.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220084_0220230 Yeah. Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220271_0220456 But then, yeah, as I said.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0221530_0222119 No, no, no, I'm not saying you can pick a user. But it should come up with some list.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222119_0222777 but an extended list of the meetings. So you have BDR, whatever it was called, 01.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222777_0223344 and then it gives you the longer name, blah, and then it gives you the participants.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223637_0223889 I'm gonna go take a shower.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223959_0224134 I
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224134_0224316 But then... Is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224316_0224556 No, it's not at all, I think. It's all too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224556_0224692 I told her, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224692_0224950 I've not tried that yet but I was going to. Massive resistance.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224950_0225317 Yeah, I'm a bit of a perfectionist now. Well, let's do that then!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225317_0225963 Yeah, I'm not sure, is that very... is that not annoying? If you have to. Get out of the bloody way!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225963_0226273 I'm gonna scratch the top of it. Yes!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226273_0226386 They do that a lot, don't they?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226386_0226994 To search for a specific user you have to hold your mouse over that one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226994_0227437 wait for it to pop up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0229882_0230290 It would just be nice to have some basic information on. Yeah, or you could have a text box there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230290_0230807 Yeah, I'm thinking that that updates. Yeah, as you go over the... Then that doesn't get in there, it's like in the wet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230807_0230954 Yeah, maybe that's the best idea then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230954_0231487 So you've got a drop down menu, a search button, not a search button.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0231713_0231788 And then...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232000_0232366 some sort of fields which updates dynamically depending on what you've highlighted.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232710_0232798 Yeah, that's sweet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0233635_0233667 See?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234346_0234496 What does normal actually stand for?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234696_0234930 Not earlier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235811_0235971 Right, right, actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235971_0236358 You've got lots of nom something and then night something and then end something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0236758_0236869 ones that need to play, some ones that...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238062_0238529 And most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying, you've got to update this Jonathan.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238529_0238836 This is unintelligible.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238898_0239158 Great!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0240763_0241021 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241021_0241212 It's not very fun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241212_0241619 Right, so anyone else got anything to say?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0242119_0242579 Do we want another meeting at the end of the week with Pernod?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243033_0243115 Yeah, it's not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243115_0243612 I mean I think I'm going to do quite a bit of work this week so I'll have probably more to talk about.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243817_0243898 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244842_0244907 If you like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244907_0245123 I think it's... We can discuss that on Friday if you have that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0245675_0245756 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0247755_0248019 I've got a doctor's appointment at 10 to 2.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0250419_0250544 감사합니다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251067_0251106 What do you think?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251571_0252344 If one's bad for you then? No, that would only give us like 35 minutes or so. Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252344_0252592 What? What? It's my arm, it's a great bother.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252592_0252753 like you know pharmacy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0253117_0253282 What's 3 o'clock? 6? It's 3, it's 6.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0254517_0254873 I'll write this meeting up and I'll send it to them as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0255359_0256031 Because she's not here. No, I mean that she collected... Oh right, oh yeah, sorry. Yeah, it's cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256031_0256612 I thought somebody was collecting them but that's what I thought we'd hear
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256612_0256834 Yeah, no, we should probably do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257021_0257501 So can we just repeat briefly what we've spoken about?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257501_0258117 So we've then done a progress on the speaker characterization. Who does the speaker characterization?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258117_0258709 We mentioned topic labeling with keywords.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258709_0259136 We discussed if the search should be ranked.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0259136_0259489 and Michael do you have anything?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260473_0260541 with the widget.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260848_0261428 well, basically not unless you've got time for it at the end.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0261428_0261548 Well, I...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263546_0263744 I think it would. How so?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263885_0264236 I think it would give you the most relevant result.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0265828_0266434 No, but for things like if you search for language, then you might have some topics which have as a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0266434_0267224 Some meetings which have as a topic language, they specifically speak about language and they use that word in every sentence.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267224_0267660 And then you've got those that just mention, you know, mention it briefly like once or twice saying,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267660_0268069 you know, my language is German or something stupid, that you don't really want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268069_0268282 So you want to distinguish those somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268282_0268379 or nuts anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268695_0268792 Yeah, very useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269326_0269623 Sometimes we can just do something really simple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269623_0269691 I mean...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272028_0272402 Yeah, just take it. So then just... Just disregard.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272402_0272761 Yeah, I mean, you just do it really simply, you know?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272761_0273228 We'll have to talk to Pranila about this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0273228_0273333 We are using anatomy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274023_0274217 It doesn't have to be all intelligent.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274503_0274584 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281142_0281256 It's not scary.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281256_0281671 Okay, yeah, they're already searched but there are 75 meeting. Is that really? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283154_0283256 Yeah, it's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283612_0284081 It would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284081_0284542 but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284934_0285207 You know, you still want to be able to search for the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285410_0285498 Yes, I agree.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285850_0286022 We will discuss it again on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0002306_0002541 Does it squeeze in like that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0005698_0005937 Het is geen roze geven water.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0009179_0009353 Did I just say the same thing as you just said to me?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0010398_0010516 So now we're getting it all.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017338_0017486 T'as un bon stop, là, là, je sais.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017486_0018262 The data processing is fine, but I don't particularly want to do the GUI for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018262_0018397 No, not really.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018397_0019186 If some of you want to do that. Yeah, I was thinking about. Then tell me how you want the data presented. How, because tell me, tell me what you want to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019186_0019778 So in my mind, I've created two classes, one that represents speakers and one that represents
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019778_0020295 on there represents the meetings and the information about both is contained within each object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020295_0020877 So, and then they write objects and the objects contain all the information about the meetings and the speakers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020877_0021528 So the speakers that are at the meetings, and the amount they speak, and then the averages that are contained with the speakers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021528_0021812 So there's two separate classes, do you see what I mean? Okay, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021812_0021965 and they're two different objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021965_0022709 and you can write the rights to the objects and then you call the objects back and those returned objects have all the information that they need.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0022709_0023131 and then you can call methods to return whatever you want. Okay, yeah, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023131_0023532 or everything, but that's why I wanted to know what's the easiest way to handle data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023891_0024199 Yes, basically all came around to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024199_0024593 And all store is objects so the object phones. All right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024593_0025389 Which means that you just call the nlnod constructor and call the load thing and call it that and you can create a list of them or a vector with them or whatever you want to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025463_0025733 And then we just call one at a time to populate window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025733_0026149 But that's what I wanted to know, what format do you want the data to come back in?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026149_0026783 Because it can come back as almost anything. It shouldn't come back as anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026783_0026961 It's the easiest to describe.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0028239_0028328 Yeah, it came in a shirt.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0029102_0030576 So I can have it so that it returns you a... At the moment, the main data structures are hash tables for the meetings that say it's got one that says percent, it's called percent talk.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030576_0030860 One is percent noise and one is percent participation.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030860_0030913 Do you still mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030913_0031695 And then it's got inside, it's got a link, it's got the speaker's name, and then it's got their percentage for that thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0031695_0032375 So it can either come back as a, you can have the hashtag or you can have it returned as a vector and it will say noise.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032375_0032689 It's just a strange noise X%
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032689_0032977 We will say a vector that's cool, I don't know, whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032977_0033810 You can either have it like an embedded vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0033810_0034240 What the easiest thing to do without anyone in this play?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0034640_0034795 Yeah, you hit all the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0035962_0036317 See that's the key. How do we...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0036622_0037082 If it's in that format, it's stupid.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037082_0037710 Speaker is the controlling thing, not... Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037768_0038191 So all of this, all that's calculated as well, store the speaker in place. Oh, is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038191_0038361 Yeah, that's easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038361_0038476 So it's quite amusing actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038476_0038941 The influences. I lived in Germany for six months, don't know if that had any effect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038941_0039137 I spent too much time talking to Brits.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039137_0039381 That was super salty.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039381_0039876 I don't need to be in the camera frame.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039876_0040167 So then all that is calculated as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040167_0040336 all I have to do is get the dialogue out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040336_0040428 Suntem femeile bruscă.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041434_0041734 So then, how is this box populated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041734_0041973 Is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042237_0042339 The one present.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042950_0043546 Because at the moment I'm using, there are methods that say, that I'm using for other torture methods.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0043546_0044062 So I was processing it, it says like, get, get talk time. And you, and you type the name.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044062_0044474 So that would call that and call the meetings method that's here to turn that on.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044474_0044823 and that would populate that, which would be an easy thing to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044823_0045043 I mean that would
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046352_0046390 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046899_0047044 Yeah, yeah, that would be easy as well, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047199_0047239 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047239_0047777 Felly byddwn i'n rhoi llawer o ffyrdd sy'n dod yn ôl un cyfnod ar y cyfnod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047777_0048030 That would be the easiest way to do it. Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048030_0048200 Okay. Yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048700_0048948 get to all the time I think it's probably worth it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049571_0049713 No, the store is in object 5.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049713_0050140 prices a whole lot of line is a nice it okay and then they're much much smaller
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050140_0050561 Only left one without one cake. So it's all just pre-processed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050561_0050671 Yeah, there's a great princess.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050671_0050993 Ac yna mae'n dweud i chi fod y byd yn cael ffwrdd o ffwrdd yn y ffyrdd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050993_0051116 So you have to recreate the object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051116_0051305 It's called a load method.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051305_0051769 So what you do is you call a null constructor because if you call the proper constructor for each meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051769_0052052 It goes off and does all the processing and stores its own object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052052_0052355 and then if you call a Null Constructor.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052355_0052804 Then you can call load and you can call load on whatever one or all of them or anything like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052804_0052879 Жесть!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053397_0053633 Bu arada Jeffery içmeyi temizle.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053683_0053812 What I, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053812_0053941 I wonder if the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054355_0054561 It just tells you who participated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054561_0055144 At the moment, it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages and in time as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055391_0055574 Yeah, it'll be a lot easier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055903_0056071 Я их давно не чувствую.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056071_0056435 That would cause a problem with anything that wasn't annotated for topics.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056752_0056795 I am.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056795_0057141 No, I've just been specified, yeah, by default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057141_0057373 There are some deeper ones actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057373_0057710 I love you, thank you for your energy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0058924_0059029 Yeah, yeah, that would be probably not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059029_0059346 And then you can do a search over the meetings, over the objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059346_0059579 Because that's the thing, these are so small.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059579_0060210 Gallwch chi roi'r cyfan i'r holl ddau i ddod i mewn i gyd i ddod i mewn i gyd i ddod i mewn i gyd i ddod i mewn i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i ddod i gyd i gyd i ddod i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i g
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0060210_0060321 So it doesn't crash the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061027_0061353 The glands come straight off that, don't they?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061353_0061562 Because they're just for the meat.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061822_0062225 The speaker class knows about all of that stuff. And the meeting class knows about that stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0062858_0063016 Да, да, вот это я и хотел.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063289_0063528 But we weren't there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063528_0063805 I thought the other stuff was more important anyway, so I did that first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064279_0064838 No, design the game first, because the problem is if you change the classes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064838_0065272 the object's serial number is changing and you can't reload the object so all the processing has to be done over again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065272_0065398 and I haven't quite finished it yet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065605_0065949 It would become out of sync and get a bit funny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065949_0066289 If I gave you one. If I gave you it now and you worked on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066289_0066787 and then I changed it and ran the thing again, you wouldn't have been able to load the objects back up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066787_0067293 And then you'd have multiple copies of objects all over the place and it'd get... ...tilly, I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0067637_0068265 But if you want to make a picture, you can do that without anything. What do you mean a picture? Just the intention.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068265_0068459 Tak, idę.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068459_0068569 Yeah, but it's not gonna take long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068569_0068860 That doesn't play with me. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069110_0069420 Well, it won't take very long to get everything finished, will it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069420_0069766 But I need to untangle this stuff to you first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069766_0069924 Because otherwise the objects won't be the same.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0070656_0070793 But I still have my own direction.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071077_0071212 응원하게 해줄게요
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071212_0071434 Вайсфлист такой, глядя на него.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089041_0089444 That way it doesn't crash and you try and load all 10 in one and it crashes doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089444_0090063 It's a bit dumb if you load up 10 different engines simultaneously.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090063_0090305 You can do that. Fine. I'm sure you can.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090305_0090583 I can't do them. I can't do them if it thinks they're one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090583_0091142 because it's about the amount that each... You have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091142_0091801 but if you don't know, yeah, it says okay, oh yeah, I've got all this space, you can use that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091801_0091884 I'm the ice guy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091884_0092582 I told you, man.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0092582_0093326 said nice machine again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094276_0094351 Ah bah d'accord, d'accord.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094351_0094424 I've been too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094645_0094693 Ouais, pour pas.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094693_0094753 stiff move
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099083_0099438 It's an SD browser
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099438_0100082 Some speech and some music. It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0101925_0102381 Or a switchboard that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102381_0102717 Load me a meeting, load me a search, load me something else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102717_0102797 whistle a tune
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0105945_0106173 Click on something stupid in a t-shirt
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106173_0106536 It would need you to have a meeting later before you start doing any searching.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106774_0107296 The only thing since search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you load it in observation.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0107942_0108922 Which means, it doesn't matter, you could use the inverted file search to return a list of meetings and then use one of those to load a search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0108922_0109064 под любо...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109368_0109743 It has to be an observation and even if you go and search the whole corpus from that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109743_0110080 but you have to have, it has to start with something for some bizarre reason.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110080_0110675 The engine, there's only one search method to the search engine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110675_0110886 The engine class only has one section.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0111483_0111596 Yeah, totally.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118131_0118293 It doesn't take long to learn that anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118293_0118486 You can light a damn one up, it doesn't have any...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0120372_0120433 세팅을 해보겠습니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121092_0121255 It only gives one at a time anyway, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121255_0121388 Because otherwise you'll crash the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0124992_0125139 It's not too slow though, I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125139_0125328 It's not too bad on that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125328_0125523 I thought they'd never be able to tame a human.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125936 Yeah, I'm like...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130214_0130271 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130271_0130817 Make it strings for as long as possible and then on your return things when they actually split and it needs to, it has to slip.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130817_0130921 from these five notions.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132245_0132471 did we think about
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132681_0132824 better names for the meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134197_0134354 あ、俺だって言ってたよ、グリップのスタイルで
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134607_0134666 Good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134666_0134793 Okay, let's wait a little bit
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134793_0134875 I'm going to see Zerg.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135077_0135305 That's a working group, is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135332_0135852 I wanna see the videos about David better, I understand.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0136433_0136556 Okay, let's go, let's go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138033_0138314 So who would have the ideas?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138314_0138521 I mean the DFs.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138521_0138764 document frequencies for each word.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139058_0139344 Yeah, to do what Tiske is talking about you do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139344_0139509 To do the top hit, like...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0140243_0140790 If somebody's done the keywords, the IDFs or the DFs are ready with me, not too probably.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143073_0143304 How do you do an inverted file search without the TFID?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143503_0144032 I think you need to do that. It would have been like a list though.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144032_0144273 The amount that they occur over the term documents
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144273_0145030 basically the amount of the sample DF is the document frequencies the amount that each word occurs no what is it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0145030_0146188 Yn ystod y ffragwnt, mae'r amser yn digwydd yn un o'r rhain, yma yw'r amser sy'n digwydd yn un o'r gweithdrau ac yma yw'r amser sy'n digwydd yn unigol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0146188_0146938 So the more it occurs in specific documents compared to its general score, the more informative it is about a certain...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147303_0147608 The vocal corpus, the data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147937_0148548 Plus a stop list so you remove stuff that doesn't, like and and the, which is going to have a basically equal score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148743_0148810 face top
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148964_0149212 Lots of keywords. Bunch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149212_0149416 That's probably the easiest. Just a list of, like...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149416_0149507 Keywords or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149507_0149838 You need to keep those teeth sharp. What's the I in TFIDO?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149838_0149964 Inverse Dokument
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149964_0150187 term frequency and their stocking frequency.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0150429_0150823 I did do it once, I do have a Java class that does it for something, I don't know whether it'll work.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0152722_0153001 Also, keywords give you an eye on a whole new type of search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153001_0153109 I see you have the key right there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153109_0153454 but you could do keyword search, could be topic search, can be the same thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153454_0154048 Ond byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud the key words.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0154203_0154315 First, to sell me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0155341_0156222 I suppose even calculating the what's-his-face's themselves would be too normal.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0156222_0157189 The easy bit is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole currencies in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157189_0157624 Because you don't have to integrate as much. Yeah, definitely. Information.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157973_0158359 No, you can do search without TFID if you just can't rank the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0158970_0159494 No, no, no, but isn't that what the idea was in the first place? To rank the results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160264_0160488 Yeah, but that won't slow it down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160488_0160600 ranking or a slowdown.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161107_0161604 It still uses an in vitro but it ranks the results by the amount by the height. That would just be a nice extra. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161604_0161818 I thought that was part of it but yeah, it doesn't matter.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162242_0162710 No we didn't. So what? It's only intimate.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162977_0163392 But yeah, I guess if that's not part of it, don't worry about it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0163561_0163750 Cause I'm only gonna do this if I've got time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164726_0164813 We'll just give you a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164813_0165282 That was the whole point. This is your top one, this is your bottom one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166295_0166492 That's it. That's how informative it is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166492_0166721 That TFIDF is an informaty score, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0167959_0168230 That's how you treat your compound nouns. It's not a compound noun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0168416_0168525 Bull-eye what?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169308_0169412 That's a compelling note.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169412_0169892 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169892_0170033 I can add it to the video.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170303_0170774 In its most simple form, it would do a separate rank for each one, each turn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170774_0171163 You could make it more complicated and make it... Let's not make it more complicated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0171523_0171710 The way you were doing it, we were just looking for the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172042_0172133 Well, that's way we're thinking.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172133_0172283 Yeah, you thought it was...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0173224_0174008 I guess you just do a sum of the individual TFIDF for each term returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174008_0174408 and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174408_0174774 And the higher, the more informative each term is for each thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174957_0175023 It's a beautiful thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175023_0175228 It's pretty crude anyway, this is looking for...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175414_0175908 If it's all it's going to do is look for separate... Oh, because then it's going to go into the NXT section and turn that into it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175908_0176137 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176137_0176267 Yeah, yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176267_0176403 So yeah, that's the screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176403_0176608 Um...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177487_0177584 Groot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177584_0178053 Yeah, without doing any like, um, word paths. Or also, like, do you...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0178851_0179386 Yeah, that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179386_0179709 That's um... Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179709_0179940 The idea is that gives you an uniformity score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179940_0180210 how you combine those is up to you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180210_0180351 I guess, there's lots in there, there's...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180351_0180980 If you were, there's a whole load about it in Manning and Shudder.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180980_0181393 They've got a whole chunk about, so just IR, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181393_0181581 basically.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181581_0181729 They've got a good chance haven't they?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181729_0181889 If you haven't got it, it's on Cognac.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182495_0182581 Ne diyeyim?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182581_0182878 Hundreds of videos.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0187627_0187906 You know, now I'm just not talking to anyone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188687_0188748 I guess I
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188748_0188875 Yeah, I guess that's huge.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0197880_0198070 They can have the same preferences.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198070_0198284 Can't have a safe first ever conference season again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198795_0199338 Well, alright, call it favourites then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199338_0199448 You can't have a fight with this!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199722_0200105 yes not like they come back every day and do the same
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0201502_0201561 para que parezca
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0204803_0204956 Yeah, it would be quite good if it has, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0205719_0206009 That's not what I'm suggesting. I'm just saying like these are
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207456_0207592 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207592_0207657 Que inferno.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208096_0208257 Yeah, we'll search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208257_0208441 So even if it just had two things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208441_0208990 just said, one said, take me straight to this meeting and have them text me what you're going to do, or drop down menu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208990_0209204 And then another one that said search that loaded instantly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209204_0209467 I do have a session, like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209594_0209856 Yeah, yeah, or one that, yeah, or one that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211013_0211248 The only thing to do is just have it search as the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211248_0211482 just it opens and the search window opens.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211482_0211798 And that's the interface. You just go from there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212121_0212516 and then that brings up the browser after you've searched for something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212516_0213348 Or the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just and a go button that said take me to this. Oh, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213348_0213571 So they're sitting inside the search van? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213571_0214400 So the only thing that comes up when you finish is a, when you start, it's just one window like that. And it's got all the search stuff right down there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214400_0214615 So this is your search?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214615_0215164 just over here and here is just go to wherever and go back.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215164_0215514 And then from there it takes you to wherever you want to go. Yeah, that's what...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215704_0216048 And at the top it says welcome to our browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0216813_0216963 じゃあ、じゃあ。
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217344_0217656 Ah, you want to hunt. Well, we don't do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217831_0217942 was him to kill him.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0218438_0218515 Yes, Timmy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219079_0219129 I jeden czas.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219733_0220248 This is a good one. If you want to search, just search. If you want to look for one meeting, just look at it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220248_0220721 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220721_0221165 One there, you got two, one for me, one for Sleek.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221165_0221415 and you can choose, you can go for a go or go for the other.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221415_0221477 God, I have a butt.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221477_0221637 et les guérir.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0223369_0224053 We could do Microsoft's die and hold it over it and it pops up a thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224202_0224302 Is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224883_0225023 Massive number isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225023_0225259 Action this time. Well, let's do that then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225832_0226409 Get out of the bloody way, I'm trying to set up the debut!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227076_0227367 Yeah, that's the way.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227367_0227691 That's why you could just have a list of your users then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227691_0227942 And just to just say I want to look for this season.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228029_0228112 Salut.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228112_0228471 Finally, and then it pulls up a list of all the ones who got that newsletter.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228471_0228698 And then you search, then you search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228698_0229192 Maybe just leave it, just have them leaking names to it and don't worry about the speakers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229192_0229367 They're doing speak because they're doing such.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229367_0229594 It's not the same as doing the quick exits.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230146_0230659 Or you can have a text box there that's got... Yeah, I'm thinking that that updates. Yeah, as you go over there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230659_0230821 then that doesn't get inverted slightly in the way.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0232469_0232617 the full name and then speak it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233013_0233294 We can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233465_0233505 Nothing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233723_0233769 and cold.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233769_0233929 I think. No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233929_0234025 他們一起感動
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0234538_0234956 I think it's a night object model.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235175_0235508 Yeah, it is, you're right, it's the right covers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235508_0235796 Night right corpus and then you got night right elements in it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235796_0236117 You've got lots of numbs on you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0236408_0237040 I think the N ones are interfaces and the night one, one of the ways around, one's an interface and one's actually an implemented cast.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237040_0237498 Because you go back enough, I think um, what's his name?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237498_0237773 The API is alright, but there's not a lot of description in it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237773_0237959 It's very cruel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237959_0238103 It says you are.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239098_0239480 So you end up just as it returns an M text box.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239480_0239560 So okay, what's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239583_0240106 It's an implementation of an N text interface.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240106_0240169 What's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240169_0241198 Oh, it's an extended version of it. Stop it!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0242760_0242869 Not useful one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0243694_0243809 Ja, és hát ebből mutatom rá.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0244908_0245011 I'm freaking disconnected
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246177_0246362 Just after I speak to you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246973_0247021 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247021_0247144 That means to write.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247460_0247646 You didn't forget all of this stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247646_0247742 Yeah, that can be fine, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248492_0248785 Friday morning?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248940_0248994 Great clip, Ernie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249148_0249215 I died
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249215_0249491 Maybe, I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0250517_0250815 So we say 3 o'clock and then if there's a serious world matter...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252439_0252628 It's fine, I'm a bit worried about them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252792_0252904 Free is better than fine and safe.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253216_0253648 It's just straight, side, side, straight, go. And then, if there's a problem with that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253648_0254165 then hysteria can cause a problem, and five or six will be a problem. I have no idea.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254165_0254342 I think that will be an awesome day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254982_0255215 Is she collecting them? No!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255215_0255501 You just sent me to tears. Because she's not here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255501_0255898 I mean, she collected... Oh right, oh yeah, sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256003_0256253 School for the gifted
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256327_0256480 I thought somebody was collecting them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256480_0256648 That's what I thought you said.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256898_0257262 then we know who's missed them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268426_0268832 Yeah, that would help. In that sense, for single tabs it would be very useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268832_0269419 For multiple terms, unless you want to do something... There will be a way of doing it for multiple terms.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0269767_0270631 Or you could do it and override it by the... You could just ignore the ranking if it doesn't show up together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0270631_0270975 Or you could penalize it, you could just put a blank...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271207_0271446 Yeah, you do the NXT shirt so it doesn't show them together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271446_0271683 either disregard it or put a weight on it and get sick.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271683_0271921 So how many pairs you get?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272131_0272336 Yeah, just like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272981_0273098 Yeah, that's a good one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274286_0274539 Because some things you're going to get a lot of results for.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274539_0274873 And if the one that you got just happens to be at the bottom when it was actually the most relevant one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274873_0275008 So the thing was all scrunch it up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276454_0276627 This is the highlight scene.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276627_0277014 And also, with something like Sunny Day,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277014_0277640 The, if Sunny and Day aren't mentioned together a lot, but Sunny's separation is one,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277640_0277942 that its term will be low and it will push down the other one if you combine them together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277942_0278075 We just add them together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279124_0279167 Yeah, yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279167_0279738 But you have no ranking system at the moment, so if something's an amazing, highly ranked thing from the TFIPF, you have to go for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279738_0280798 it could just ignore them because it falls off the bottom of the... I'm assuming you only have... you should return all results for all... say you type language and it returns 75 meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281067_0281627 I don't know when we'll see it. But there are 75 meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281627_0281677 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281996_0282399 So yeah, if you return 75, where do you stop?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282399_0282559 How do you write them or something?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282559_0283107 Well if it turns 20, even if it turns 20, do you cut it off at 10? Do you rank them? Do you... That's true. Okay. What's the threshold?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283107_0283196 отваренное выпить.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283425_0283566 Dat is helemaal mooi.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283566_0283669 Well, at the time...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287489_0287536 Is that it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287733_0287945 Done.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0288070_0288203 I've timed off already.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0004764_0005099 If you're doing comments.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0005099_0005160 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0006711_0006820 See you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0010769_0011623 One thing that I was wondering, is there standard control that you use to connect the different things that you're doing?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0011623_0012020 like you're in a topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012020_0012646 Is there a particular type of control, like is there one of these NXT or sorry, Knight controls?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012646_0012722 in a way.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0015854_0016228 You haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016228_0016669 like other topics or... Well, we're going to do one for speaker, I guess, in the restroom.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016669_0016708 Wait, what?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016779_0017338 Well, okay. When we talk about speaker characterization, how are we accessing the list of speakers?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026808_0026979 Das ist die Städteskunde am Salzburger Hockenheim.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026979_0027329 Like when he was talking about like having architecture that things are gonna plug into.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027329_0027798 I mean, so the things are all modular. I mean, it would be a good idea if we used that same idea for anything else we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027798_0027954 What else are we doing?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027954_0028342 Yeah, even in searches or whatever. Yeah, it can.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0028342_0028849 I mean search results are thrown in a predictable thing with a name, certain properties or listed properties.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0033745_0033849 I have a...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034053_0034342 How are you going to do this? Blank? I can do it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034378_0034788 It's just a matter of deciding what would be easiest. All the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049224_0049723 So each time you're going straight to the XML files for the information? No, it's stored as an object file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049723_0049757 Precious.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049757_0049850 هذا هو لايك.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049850_0049965 I hope it is a nice fit.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049965_0050004 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050258_0050422 Without 1K
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050422_0050663 So that's all just pre-processed? Yeah, just all pre-processed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051309_0051345 Срывой убей!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051959_0052044 Right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0052811_0053116 Is it for the entire corpus?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053116_0053476 Or is it just like individual ones, like one object for each?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053476_0053540 Smash!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053540_0053686 I want me to believe in God.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053919_0054132 I wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054132_0054324 Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054355_0054385 It's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054871_0054911 R.I.P.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0056609_0057022 or just return a null or a blank or... No, it has been specified, yeah, by default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0060208_0060258 Settar.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071484_0071909 Actually I can upload my stuff as well, I just have to make one change to your phone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071909_0072240 just to load this one instead of the default. All right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0072240_0072566 So, that's two lines of code. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073070_0073163 Um, what do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073336_0073698 Well yeah, just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074114_0074311 Well, your version.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074427_0074693 I did it in my directory. Just kidding.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074876_0075176 I have a copy, yes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075176_0075245 I'm deaf.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075245_0075906 But I will, yeah, I was going to update that one. It just makes sense that you can... Well, just tell me when, because I usually...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076114_0076300 breakouts and then update.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076547_0076744 Yeah, I have been making changes to it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076744_0076902 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076902_0077102 I'll just make that one note.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077311_0077597 Because, like I said, two lines of code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077597_0078132 And then you can play.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078132_0078233 There's not much to do, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078233_0078625 Have to get better results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078938_0079543 And just to wire in the topics and do some summaries.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0079543_0080115 I mean the highlighting stuff. Well, also, yeah, like that as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080115_0080211 for you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080297_0080874 just want to find what kind of objects that was worth it for the other ones
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080874_0081304 So, I'm glad you haven't had that stuff, because that's...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0082326_0082359 What the f-
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085593_0085681 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085892_0086548 Okay, there's a few more things to do with that and then now once Penelo gets the index
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086548_0086820 So, I think that's gonna be kind of fun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086820_0087170 I'm just wondering if you had to... well the way you were doing it, I was gonna ask if the way you were doing it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087170_0087588 You're reloading like a new corpus each time for your training, but you're doing the object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087588_0088289 So you don't need to just because if we if we do have like the inverted search says that there's young
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0088289_0089001 10 documents are we going to have to load each of these 10 corporeal just to do the individual next T-String.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0089380_0089533 It's a big problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090150_0090373 I'm crying. I'm serious. I can't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090373_0090406 Değil mi?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090860_0091294 You have to call a new class and then it will do it fine but if you don't...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091294_0091408 That's insane.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091738_0092049 Otherwise the guys will know!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0093795_0093898 Feel that in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099112_0099725 It's an MSD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099725_0099959 I just... I just...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099959_0100154 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100154_0100590 We have to, while we're debugging.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100590_0100987 But something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103440_0103544 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103783_0103949 And that because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104515_0104905 I was just going to ask if we should assume that they'll want to load a meeting first, but not necessarily.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104905_0105239 I guess if you're doing a search on the entire...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0105765_0105892 And so that's...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0106555_0106792 Well, we can cook the chicken.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107270_0107714 I could probably even. That shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107714_0107884 And if it hasn't loaded, then force him to load it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111723_0111938 Unless they know what me to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111938_0112083 Well, it's one of them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0113546_0114127 Or, well, the things I mean, just be looking for a word and, you know, it shows up at ten different meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114127_0114868 Then at that point they'll probably want to... Like, if it by default goes with the first one and they want number 5, the ones that are returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114868_0114978 이거는 내가 뺏길 거야
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115184_0115431 Well, not like to a lot of... Like the thing is, I think...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115580_0116003 Like when it loads up, it'll load up the transcript window and whatever other window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116003_0116206 Right now I think just the topic lines.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116206_0116826 Although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116826_0117456 So I'm just thinking if it's kind of like you're saying, you have to have a normal object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117456_0117835 I mean, before you do, I search it all. Yeah, but local search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117876_0117953 You can do the levels.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117953_0118007 I'll try.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118453_0118825 Yeah, but the global one feeds into the local.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118825_0119318 So if we're getting any useful data, it's going to be doing a search on each of those files.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0119318_0119664 So it's going to be loading up each of those at a time to get the data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0120470_0120896 But it could be time-consuming, like if there are 10 documents that... Well yeah, that's always going to be...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121424_0121743 Um, yeah, well, just thinking of some way we could, you know...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121743_0122317 I'll just cache the results in a nice little format that'll make things a bit easier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0122317_0123043 But the thing is, if we've got that, then it's going to be needing really to load the entire corpus for that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123043_0123539 If it's trying to show us where those were, if it's trying to highlight those in the text, transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123539_0123775 And we're gonna have to have all that other game.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123775_0124048 So each time we have a search window and we have like, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124048_0124307 attend different meetings, the word wireless comes up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124307_0124688 Go to meeting one and then Heston's. Reload the non-object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124688_0124836 Next one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124836_0125272 I mean that's kind of... Yeah, it's not too slow though I don't think. It's not too bad on the first try.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125272_0125338 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125539_0126076 It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least. Like that's all I've been doing lately is just loading it up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126076_0126392 Tested, trashed one, shut down, boiler.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126392_0126975 Yeah. So just sort of based on that as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126975_0127464 But if it doesn't take that long each time then it should be alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0128741_0128774 YUM
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0129973_0130006 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0130824_0131060 Bueno, ahí está la imagen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131060_0131406 And that way they know specifically which meaning it is. Yeah. That'll save the time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131406_0131880 Because I'm sure they don't want to have the extra loading time either if they can avoid it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131880_0132180 So yeah, or they can check more and give us the ones they want to check.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0132988_0133108 I think they were in the text.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0133108_0133838 We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of BDB, you know, just do a stream.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134088_0134278 Have a lovely day today.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134278_0134441 We got to test this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134441_0134649 Like the work group that it's part of.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134767_0134902 I probably just deserve it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135309_0135394 Oh
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135999_0136107 It's accurate.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0138712_0139019 Do I actually need the frequencies?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139480_0139554 Alright, Dad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139574_0139634 오케이 오케이
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140160_0140436 The whole thing is if it's being done... If somebody's done the keywords or...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140755_0141096 There's a class she's trying to get to work on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141096_0141729 They did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141729_0142205 But it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff, but the last I heard it wasn't working.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142205_0142825 She's going to look at a more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142825_0143125 But if we need the, if we do need the frequencies.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143368_0143467 Um, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143784_0144054 Well, it would have been like a list of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0144389_0144452 Put the sample.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147353_0147533 Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147533_0147825 See ya.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147825_0148187 Plus a stop list so you remove stuff that doesn't work.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0149632_0149922 Putz die Eier in den Tierfadier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0150668_0150690 I'm out of here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158468_0158525 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158525_0158712 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too. Do we need to?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158712_0159014 I mean we're just like- Oh! For you stuff I guess.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0159014_0159111 know but that's what this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0161982_0162591 I don't think we had that in the document. No, we didn't. So what? It's only internet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162649_0162718 I'm here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162718_0162746 I'm out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0163504_0163648 Evet, teşekkürler.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0164960_0165013 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165013_0165350 Actually, because the thing is, I mean... This is your top one, this is your bottom. Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165350_0165897 But the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting, if they're looking for a particular term or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165897_0166317 just want to know if that term exists there. And where does it exist? I want to see it. Yeah, but it's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0167571_0168186 If it's like a two-word term, does a TF-IDF...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168186_0168529 It's not a compound noun, it's just two words together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168529_0168814 Um, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168814_0168924 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168924_0169280 to something like Edinburgh University.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169446_0169675 I'm so angry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169675_0169803 Sunny days
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169803_0169843 So you're better.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0170922_0171222 Let's not make it more complicated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171385_0171739 Because the thing is, the way we were doing it, we were just looking for the words.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171739_0172055 period each word in the index.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172055_0172193 Well that's the way we were thinking. Yeah you thought well...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172193_0172508 And then it's just saying, were these two words in any of these documents?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172508_0173238 and if it wasn't we'd go closer and do the NXT switch. Yeah. So look for the exact term or the regular expression.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0175914_0176170 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176170_0176242 I'm so hot
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176617_0176931 Like I'm just wondering if it's going to give us something cool, then yeah, absolutely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176931_0177652 but if it's sort of like if the NXT search is still got to be run to find these terms or these groups yeah without
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0177957_0178333 Or also do wild cards work for something like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178333_0178889 So if you're looking for a wireless, wired, wire, blah blah blah, you can do wire with a star.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178889_0179192 Actually, that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179192_0179324 So, word.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179324_0179364 AHH
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179683_0179870 Yeah, but the idea is that gives you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180329_0180467 It's a prank cam.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180467_0180583 Okay, I don't see it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180583_0180653 Where to?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181036_0181057 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181454_0181530 I actually...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181880_0182342 Yeah, I've got it somewhere. PDF.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182591_0182876 Hundreds of videos.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182876_0183163 Do the PDF, switch it to Postscript, switch it back to PDF.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183580_0183640 UGH
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183640_0183894 Okay, that's okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0184522_0184819 Oh, okay. That's sort of the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0186835_0186923 Pretty.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0187258_0187797 Probably, for the most part. I mean there'll be a set of people that do a lot of stuff that you don't even know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188405_0188759 search for stuff or start working yeah i guess i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188759_0189152 Yeah, I guess that's for sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189349_0189594 Like if you're looking for something specific, like, is that what you're thinking?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189594_0190013 Like if they know exactly where they want to go, they want to go to that meeting on December 3rd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190401 and they just want to go there and see stuff, then they can immediately go and browse that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0191972_0192304 Browse by meeting, browse by mom, browse by speaker.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192304_0192679 No, I'm just thinking of different ways we can do that, like different buttons on the top.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192679_0193086 Like if they're looking for a particular person, particular working group, particular whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193086_0193671 And we just, uh... We could break things down like that, to that level of detail if we want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193671_0193905 where we could keep it more general.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195177_0195627 Yeah, but I'm just thinking like initially when they load up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195627_0195904 what are the range of things that they'd want to do?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195904_0196265 Like if they're part of X working group, they'll want to get in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196265_0196481 Do we want to save preferences?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196786_0197287 Well, if they're part of BDB working group, they're going to want to look at the BDB ones and some default to that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197287_0197384 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197610_0198058 based on what they did the last time. They can have the same preferences.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199005_0199280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199424_0199910 Just scroll down the list and find your favorite one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200239_0200457 Das ist so schade.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200457_0200585 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200585_0200849 I forgot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200922_0201065 Okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201065_0201541 Well, no, I'm just getting back to sort of what could be on the startup screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201541_0201912 Like there's just a range of things we could do. We could have like search options, browse options.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201912_0202445 I dunno, just playing around with ideas.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0202445_0203527 And then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say, well, if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203527_0203630 I'm gonna do this, blah blah blah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203630_0203968 So we can, yeah. Oh, right. Sort of, yeah, guide them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203968_0204271 It's just like, hey, my task is to do this and there's a button for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204271_0204383 Perfect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204383_0204496 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204496_0204529 I'm
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204529_0204737 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205682_0205884 No, to już mamy rękę.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205884_0206558 I was just saying, like, these are just, like a lot of programs, well, kind of lame programs, do have that sort of thing first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0206558_0207407 just because they don't want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the program.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207407_0207598 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207992_0208211 Probably search or something. Yeah, we'll search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209137_0209471 I just instantly, I just message like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209471_0209691 Yeah, that's the only thing I can think of.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0210971_0211077 Well, damn, thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217577_0217753 Well, we don't actually have usernames, do we?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217753_0218050 We're going through all these codes listening to the other neural networks.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218519_0218657 In a case like that, we do want proctol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218657_0218789 We don't want them to type from duty.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219359_0219525 and allow multiple
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219563_0219865 Okay, you're just looking for one specific. This is Google. If you want to search yourself.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0221052_0221142 Amazing what this is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0224492_0224581 It's a long way from here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0227069_0227251 Yeah, that's true, that's annoying.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230548_0230731 Then that doesn't get any better
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230731_0230930 best idea
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234609_0234815 Concept model.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234815_0235146 I think in that case it's the right corpus.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235146_0235208 No
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235208_0235417 Yeah, it is, you're right, it's the right colours, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0236358_0236513 Yeah, I think the N ones.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0239953_0240051 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240638_0240914 Help me
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240914_0240980 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0241644_0241921 Not really, just gonna keep on going.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0242621_0243025 Might be useful, wouldn't it? Yeah. Like Friday afternoons.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0243877_0244106 And we won't have to have the meeting with Steve on Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244106_0244159 Brutal.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244241_0244628 Do we want to get this one earlier?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244628_0244888 3? 3.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245098_0245167 J'ai un peu de stupide
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245587_0245678 You could. Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246596_0246706 Possibly, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246706_0246996 Usually by then. Need a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246996_0247596 I don't know, because it's the lab and try and get some work done.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248060_0248216 Okay, right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248216_0248298 and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248688_0248940 3 o'clock?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248940_0249187 Where do you want to kiss? Oh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249187_0249353 Maybe I did, I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249353_0249436 Un des classiques, hein?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249767_0249998 I think she's got a class of 11.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249998_0250371 with Olga Krakow, 3rd class class 12.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250371_0250565 How about suicide?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250776_0250894 Or we could try one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250894_0251001 We could try shortly after.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251001_0251148 Yeah, well yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251148_0251339 Well, it wouldn't be a long meeting then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251339_0251379 I'm free.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251379_0251707 Would you wanna? No, probably not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251707_0251921 If one's bad for you, then you won't have it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252235_0252278 I'm okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252855_0252933 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259469_0259873 That's just sort of the basic implementation stuff that I was really involved in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259873_0260094 Je vais porter mon petit téléphone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260094_0260376 Profession?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260376_0260692 Did we decide whether it should be ranked?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260798_0260979 for nothing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0261426_0262136 Well, I kinda think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262136_0262837 just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document, it's not really getting them together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262837_0263091 Like if someone's looking for a particular term.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263091_0263526 I don't know, I just... I just don't know if it would bring us that much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263668_0263708 Powerful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264093_0264561 give you the most relevant result. If they're looking for, like I say, a sunny day and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264561_0264931 Sunny shows up in this document, Dave shows up with the map together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264931_0265179 Or if they are too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0265179_0265811 But it just doesn't... you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up, it shows up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0268462_0268812 In that sense, for single tabs it would be very useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0269500_0269766 Just something really simple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270757_0270985 penalize it you could just put a blank to do the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270985_0271210 You still have to do the NXT shirt trend.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271210_0271367 Yeah, you do the NXT shirt so it doesn't show up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271367_0271506 time together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271599_0271853 waiting in this video if you how many pairs you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271853_0272207 It wouldn't show up on the search results if it didn't exist.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0272813_0273225 We'll have to talk to Pernilla about this. Yeah. See how she's doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0273225_0273883 We are using that. It does make sense for that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274305_0274557 Some things you're gonna get a lot of results for.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274879_0275247 Something that I would just brush it up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275247_0275434 Yeah, okay, I'll switch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275434_0275852 And then we could actually put that like on the list of meetings that get returned to us.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275852_0276514 there are 15 meetings of languages in and it's going to show you those and rank them as to which is the highest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0276514_0276625 It's okay, I see that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278040_0278313 Well, the thing is, I mean, that'll be exactly how we're doing it now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278313_0278617 Like we're just looking for the two words separately, see if they exist in the same document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278617_0278907 If they do, then there's a possibility that they occurred together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278907_0279111 And then we do the NXT search on that document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0279318_0279373 So if
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280821_0280998 Well, breakdowns aren't doing anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280998_0281269 I don't know what he's doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281269_0281344 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281344_0281597 But there are 75 meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281597_0281750 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0282891_0282954 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0283224_0283732 It would be useful as well for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0287628_0287707 Yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0002063_0002511 to get everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0004128_0004707 お腹すいた
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0006734_0007677 I got you. I'm going to stay. You seem slippery.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0007677_0008425 Maybe I can sit here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0008425_0008509 Call it a year on ya.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0011420_0012024 Was that an answer? No, that's just summary. No. No. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012024_0012207 But...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012207_0012328 Oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019391_0019703 I think that's it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019703_0020121 Good fish, dear.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0021504_0021700 I'm so embarrassed
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0024953_0025451 Long time, Jax.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0026983_0027218 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0028081_0028133 Hello.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0033434_0033643 That's good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0035739_0035785 unique
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0039504_0039938 That took me so long to do this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0042040_0042072 아, 맨날
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0052524_0052865 Yeah! I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0068919_0069261 I'm only interested in this guy because he seems to be funny
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0069261_0070287 Forgive me, yeah. Let's take him to the next joke. That'd be quite good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0084666_0084871 Yeah, the top left.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087192_0087460 They have like big yellow lenses.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087460_0088218 I've never seen that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0088236_0089082 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0089082_0089224 어!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0095446_0096325 We have to include that in our evaluation. How did the game improve your browsing? Yes!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0099902_0100259 I guess that's why we have a separate speech lab.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0100305_0100661 Hahaha
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0101446_0102253 I'm running some troubles with the indexing but found another package instead of writing it from scratch
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0102253_0102750 I don't know. Just know that I haven't pulled around it much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0103034_0103425 We'll see what happens in the next few days.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0104085_0104232 Or as many...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0105967_0106108 I just want to try that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108083_0108360 I didn't expect this cross to be so much of a job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108360_0109058 Yeah, that's right. It feels like it's a job. It's a job, I'm good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0109058_0109200 Practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0114513_0115039 I thought we said shit. Yeah, I thought we changed it to the 10th or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0115201_0115311 So?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120108_0120189 It was so awesome.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120308_0120594 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120594_0120764 and give us the whole universe back.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121032_0121596 I've got my D&LG presentation on Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121596_0121866 too much now
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121866_0122045 But yeah, Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0122211_0122354 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0122354_0122457 I mean we could
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0122613_0122772 Should we make it up Monday?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0123208_0123252 to see you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0123581_0123733 Just like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0126228_0126447 So he's supposed to give us this subject.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0126447_0126523 そうなんだ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0127211_0128210 The thing is, we're going to get an email, right? We're looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0129220_0129630 Sorry, Spanish people. Well, they are going to need us.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0129630_0130067 So they should set up a perception project and things like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0130067_0130510 It's not going to take long. Yeah, that's true. I'm going to be hot now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0130510_0130868 We need to lose each other.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0131225_0131608 Have more of a break. So now we're gonna get him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0136194_0136389 아, 죄송합니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0136389_0136592 I was first, man.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0136592_0136905 B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0136905_0137789 You should just have two.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0137789_0137810 bleh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0137988_0138019 Почему?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0138347_0138439 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0139359_0139538 Yeah, it's too cliche.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0140159_0140213 I've had enough.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0140392_0140448 We found him
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0141076_0141216 That was the first one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0141278_0141396 To jest tamte.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0141775_0142184 It's not a good Friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0142276_0142587 It's not a good fighting. No. No! What was it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0143202_0143253 Oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0143446_0143624 No, we're talking about you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0143624_0143738 Oh, God.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0143794_0143828 BLEH!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0144842_0144924 If not, then...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0149671_0149979 after this Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0149979_0150056 Let's get to it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0150568_0150621 What?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0150780_0150807 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0151763_0151789 RIP
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0152281_0152785 Yeah, the timeline we're putting in the 25th and that's Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0152986_0153581 That's why I'm trying to... I'm trying to...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154016_0154252 That's why I'm a part of the 21st.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154557_0154768 End of lectures.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0155606_0155728 Oh, it's actually 24.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160131_0160714 Did he say anything about what he expects of the final report?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160714_0160855 Like no, I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162302_0162513 Although it's 50%
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162725_0162808 But we got
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0163258_0164252 Because this is, I mean, we have an interim report of seven pages and that's we can... Seven pages? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164252_0164518 We could probably just expand that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164660_0164909 I mean, a lot of it is going to be the same thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165229_0165633 And then I mean right about the evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165633_0165800 That's gonna be quite nice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165915_0166112 with various experiences.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166261_0166473 which is kind of weird.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166682_0166722 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0189309_0189397 Very beautiful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0189511_0189605 You could just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0198555_0199395 It should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries using that text extractor thingy, right?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0199631_0199794 Again, it's the topic.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200307_0200435 是你
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200435_0200738 Can you make a left turn?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0202466_0202569 Kızlarla...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0202681_0202785 Time for the starter?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0205438_0205932 Yeah, that was... Is that what you mean? Yeah, if I make a... Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0206507_0207067 Are we bothering them?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0207067_0207127 with our topic today.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0216280_0216363 I'm going to create this
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0216482_0217203 see what Steve says about the evaluation and then like keep in touch by email or phone.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0217410_0217555 I just want to see you in third seat.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0217789_0217848 I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0217989_0218044 and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0219012_0219251 We can just email if we need to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0219589_0219664 I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0002312_0002562 I can't do this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0002952_0003133 But, green. Green, right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0003133_0003297 Or this bit.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0003494_0003547 my boots
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0004996_0005368 Ah, sabotage!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0007291_0007454 It's a mistake.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0010815_0011006 Who wants to buy some red wine?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0011888_0011939 I'm just wondering.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0012734_0013051 Have you changed the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013694_0013806 Yeah, I forgot that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013999_0014535 No, when you said it at the beginning I thought, must check the read-write and then the hand is like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0017326_0017558 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0018698_0018894 Yes, yes, can't be but.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0019388_0019671 I've seen that look.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020309_0020675 There is a file in the directory called diskful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020863_0020953 I was
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022810_0022869 Bye-bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022869_0023008 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023380_0023460 Alright
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023621_0024047 Yeah, that was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025012_0025312 Yeah, yeah!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025312_0025661 I know they live there but there's I have even more stuff there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0026400_0026858 What did it actually do? It's huge!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0027366_0027487 太嚴肅了
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028244_0028456 Has anyone had time to play with it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028841_0028914 and comments
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0030210_0030251 You want to keep
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031013_0031119 Might as well, it's not too bad.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031119_0031314 It doesn't really do anything except make you feel better.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031314_0031602 The thing is that yeah, there is, as I said a while ago,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031602_0032314 there is still this one error which is a bug in NXT and that always generates these
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032314_0032693 I think when you left click or right click or something, I can't remember now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032835_0033593 But if it's a real error then it stops. So you can't... Yeah, I didn't discover any of those yet. I didn't have a list.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035556_0035682 Yeah, me too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035682_0036229 Is there any comments you have about just like wording or some sort of minor things?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0036931_0037073 A lot of this to have a son.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037073_0037439 At the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037439_0038026 but I would make them a bit nicer if I had more time but at the moment it doesn't look like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0038026_0038251 No, it's not, it's not, it's not, not at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0039715_0040133 That took me so long to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040229_0040610 So I'm quite glad that it looks nice on one row and all this kind of stuff.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040826_0040967 No, this is just... yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043111_0043280 That's... cold.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043872_0044186 You're not!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0044186_0045922 I've done some like that before. Really speed it up. Try that a few times. Yeah I started using your um the speaker. I don't know if you've seen that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046694_0046770 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046770_0046985 It's good. Your stuff is really good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046985_0047241 It's got a good interface and easy to use.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0047241_0047277 Nice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050087_0050345 So I'll go to that and then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050983_0051183 That's when they say, uh huh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051521_0051791 they said, oh it's kind of boring, yeah exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051791_0051870 It's very
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0052391_0052733 There, sleep on it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0053528_0054020 So which, you know, maybe you can suggest a few that would be interesting to list.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054020_0054141 Like, subscribe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054999_0055042 Sorry
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059149_0059684 I mean do we care? I don't know, it doesn't really matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059782_0060580 But it would be difficult if in the speaker characterization window we had a heading, you know, top five dialogue acts.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0060580_0061211 and then the little brackets but they're not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0062130_0062233 For the speaker.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063316_0063513 No, I wouldn't... yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063921_0064001 human head comes up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064597_0064749 We will top five this meeting and then the rest is...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064997_0065404 Yeah, just do top five, both local and global and then have another.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0065511_0066137 But then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0067354_0067828 I'm so happy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068535_0068751 Yes, and that's what speaker characterization gives you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068933_0068999 Please, the Wimble!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0070291_0071373 So, is this percentage then, if you say like, Joke for this speaker is percentage,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0071373_0072234 20. Is that the... what percentage of his speech is joke or... What percentage of the dialogue is...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0072390_0072533 in the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0076024_0076748 I'll give that credit to you. Yeah, I mean, just keep it simple.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079148_0079241 You will. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079655_0079701 Fuck it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0080298_0080635 Yeah, I was thinking that. It sort of turned out that way a bit, didn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081393_0081435 I'm a man.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081435_0081503 A to zmiany
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081701_0081788 Oh, I'm out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0083604_0084156 I have one little question that I reckon we should have a little icon for on the ground.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084458_0084804 Well, no. Oh, I know. Yeah, the top left.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084804_0085504 Remember they've got an X which is you know NXT and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that. Yeah it was.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0085748_0086228 No, I want something original
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086228_0086606 I wouldn't suggest.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086606_0086931 The only thing I can think of is an M. Yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0087488_0088107 Where have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089655_0089703 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089864_0090401 I mean it's tiny so we can't really put more than one character in it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0090996_0091065 Bir de kendi tüpen...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092316_0092511 Well if you find anything then send it to me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092623_0092786 otherwise I'll make up some ends.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093222_0093399 It's really good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093399_0093461 Really easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094007_0094383 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, yeah, I know how to put it there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094383_0094598 Okay, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094598_0094669 col cio
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094912_0095078 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0096698_0096891 Yes, it even has a...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0097278_0097652 Welcome to the meeting room. Can we get sound on these machines? No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0098936_0099810 if the sound card is registered to your name, which it usually is not, and you have to reboot, and sometimes it still doesn't work.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0109184_0109734 But it's an NXT package. Cool, let's see it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110371_0110848 I mean sometimes I have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110848_0111427 I think it was like, I'll try this then.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0114594_0114697 I thought we said
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116565_0116699 Like a chicken.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116932_0117417 Well that's the problem because Steve hasn't given us any details.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118045_0118119 That's rude.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118486_0118681 I'm sure I should do that in like a meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118798_0118957 I'm just gonna get up there. Just brainstorm, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119308_0119597 The thing is, yeah, we had the deadline last Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119597_0120310 but we won't be able to do an evaluation during the weekend anyway. So I think we could set Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0120589_0120727 and that would give us the whole case.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124504_0124539 That's why.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124539_0124631 I think that's quite right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125696_0125814 Exactly!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125814_0126195 At the end we'll say, you never gave us any tests, so James...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126439_0126709 Well, sort of, that's how I understood it. He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126709_0126933 He would make something up. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126933_0127272 Yeah, find some people. That's how I used to do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0127272_0127400 The thing is, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0128207_0129005 I think if we don't get anything from him, then we should just do our friends basically.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0129539_0129786 Well, they're your friends, so they should say that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130084_0130181 It's like knitting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130181_0130389 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0131849_0132005 Like, highly computer-like.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132005_0132102 Well, they will be.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132203_0132302 I have to be here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0133368_0133554 I was thinking of like 10.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135493_0135700 We don't want it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135848_0136057 That's it? What? That's the end?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137042_0137183 They should just have two.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137207_0137686 Да.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0138306_0139183 Another thing, we have the presentation in one and a half weeks or something, whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139183_0139283 Nearly two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139470_0139766 Oh, it's true. Yeah, it's two weeks then.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139766_0140033 Do we have to have done the evaluation by then?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141001_0141075 I understand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141075_0141211 No, it's the first one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141211_0141299 Ja, das kann sein.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141791_0141925 Sunday, Friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0142694_0142974 Well I'm sure on the website it says Thursday. Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0143656_0144109 Well, you know, the question is, do we need the evaluation for the presentation?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144673_0144807 We should definitely ask him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144807_0144937 Because if not, then...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0146055_0146174 Yeah, you might be right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0147522_0147750 Because we need to write a presentation as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148526_0148668 Exactly!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148668_0148771 That's insane.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0149119_0149585 Well, I'm not free after this Monday, but I'm free like after the next one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0150257_0150782 I mean I'm not.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0151069_0151276 That's in on the 80s. Is that in on the 80s?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0152163_0152341 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0155338_0155536 I just fancy writing them an email.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0156342_0156473 That, yep.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157162_0157354 But it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157354_0157436 part of the demonstration.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157584_0157793 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157793_0158247 I mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation I suppose.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158247_0158353 and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158660_0158735 What was the other one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158872_0159599 Basically, how is it going with your evaluation?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0159599_0160018 Have you got people who had first what you think and when?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0161530_0161870 Did we know... Did he ever say how long it was supposed to be?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162181_0162365 Just... I'm in heaven.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162784_0162869 But we can write a lot.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162869_0163120 I mean, I think we should write everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0164008_0164164 Same page. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0165590_0165676 Yeah, well, it's gonna be...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0166237_0166299 I should use it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167052_0167284 So, do you want to write me an email then? Sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167284_0167326 I mean it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167850_0168296 and when I get home today which will be before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0168622_0169192 Before half past six I will make that file readable, writable and everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169318_0169404 I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169404_0169517 Well I will...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169906_0170600 Well, I will need your snippets of code, or it would be good if I had them, by tomorrow evening.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0170935_0171105 Oh, I was gonna ask, um...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171289_0171434 At the moment, your search window.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171565_0171657 How's it organised?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172507_0172809 But at the beginning, when you haven't searched yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172809_0173357 Is it still the bad Anita too and the bottom half is just empty? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0173882_0174181 And then if you double click on one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0175887_0175963 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0176802_0177381 Well, it's the icon by the way. Yeah, I agree. Beautiful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0177559_0178451 Maybe you want to do one left click highlights the result in whatever you've got open.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178805_0178847 Get her.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178969_0179185 Various like yeah, I find the topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0179185_0179812 Usually one life plug highlights it, cross highlights everything. I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181008_0181185 Well, it's difficult because...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181679_0181767 Wait!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182347_0182533 No, it's difficult.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182533_0182797 because the transcription window does cross highlighting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182924_0183290 in a very awkward way because he has to find the topic first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183290_0183584 That was a pain.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183744_0184682 and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0184682_0185363 And that works when you left double click on a topic, on a meeting, sorry, then it loads it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185470_0185530 Sorry, kid.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185645_0185769 We could take that for loading.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185971_0186525 So if we have that the same on this one, at least that you, if you double left click then it loads.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187847_0187994 highlights, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187994_0188550 I mean, obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here. Oh, just that. But also highlights.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0188848_0188969 Actually it's difficult because...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0189484_0190231 Because you only ever have one meeting open and those resorts will be open. Well, I suppose if you have a local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190231_0190333 then you could cross eye line.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190932_0191506 Because if you get back several different meetings here and you've only got one meeting open, then you can't cross out anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0193267_0193395 What do you mean by that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0194506_0194561 Oh, I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0195663_0195780 Well, let's see what we need.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0196279_0197295 Well, in any case, if you left click on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open, then it should cross highlight. Yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0197295_0197410 If not, you can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200617_0200677 KINUMEIGO
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200781_0201493 Is it very difficult to make another GUI but only for a global search?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0201930_0202490 Just take that away, the local checkbox.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202490_0202650 Kızlarla.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202772_0202979 Yeah, because in the start of spring you can't have them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203231_0203342 Yeah, we'll be right back.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203342_0203575 That'd be pretty handy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203575_0203798 Everything else can just stay the same, you know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203798_0204134 And finally you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbox.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0204584_0204934 Radio bug.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0216087_0216123 or don't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007053_0007312 See you first!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007312_0007390 I'm on a stake
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0011917_0012147 Bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0017470_0017772 It's just having that seems a little chaos
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0019495_0019601 See you later.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0020970_0021307 I think I saw that and I
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0022410_0023001 It doesn't have anything in it. Oh really? It does, it has about three lines of XML.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023214_0023273 What's that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023775_0024183 eu te sinto eu que fodeu
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024183_0024302 That's best, alright that's my ring
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024302_0024419 This is my favorite part.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024562_0025175 I had lots of stuff in there yesterday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025175_0025310 It's a stuff. Hold on, I'm trying to think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025310_0025643 They live there, but there's I have even more stuff there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025643_0025952 I was unzipping all these crazy huge things that were in the box.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025952_0026083 I needed them, they were for this night.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0026083_0026667 It's alright. I was recording on that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027076_0027357 Yeah, it says I think it's about 8 gigs on it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027357_0027476 Say it in the song.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027476_0027982 Siis ma sõbelin teid huulevaa, et vist...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028614_0028945 I had a play of it. Yes, please.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028945_0029123 Uh, no, it's good really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029123_0029191 Yeah, that's it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029599_0030007 It generated a lot of exceptions in the background.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0030007_0030205 But that didn't cause any problems.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033280_0033537 Yeah, I didn't discover any of those, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033537_0033821 A ti te molesta. Es que tú...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033821_0034404 I fronted it to save it in break, but it didn't break too... I didn't play that long, but... It seemed alright, really, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034404_0034674 And the start up screen looks quite good, looks alright.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034674_0034783 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036267_0036363 No, that's right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036363_0036835 The only thing is that the start-up screen is not too pretty.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036835_0037111 I'm not going to be able to do this job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038021_0038352 No, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not the top priority.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038566_0038773 I think it'd look better on Windows as well actually.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038773_0039024 Because Java uses the native Windows, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0039343_0039428 Actually, can we?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0040098_0040140 to it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0041480_0041897 Well the um, the um, the speech characterisation is finished.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042029_0042437 I haven't done it, I haven't updated all those objects for us yet though because it takes ages on these computers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042437_0042884 It's faster for some bizarre reason if I log in at home and then run the code
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042884_0043116 It runs it much faster than if I do it here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043276_0043666 Wait, that's- I can't afford to sit in the lab and wait half an hour. Can you connect to your home?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043889_0044535 I tried to punch him like that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0044535_0044929 Really speed it up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045839_0045916 I swear. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045916_0046646 so that it tells you what speakers are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0046646_0046715 It's so not her.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047380_0047894 The dialogue ads are all done and they're quite amusing sometimes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047894_0048815 But some of them, some of the things, actually what I wanted to talk about that a little bit was there are some that occur all the time that I just, and I don't know how interesting there are.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0048815_0049448 So the first one statement is that it will I've removed it because it was like everything is prefixed by statement
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0049448_0050088 Every single dialogue act starts with a statement. So everybody's top dialogue act is a statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050088_0050129 What a day!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050245_0050314 So I'll go over to that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050314_0050682 and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050682_0050792 Well, I don't know what that means.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050792_0050952 So you know as well as me, back channel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051210_0051277 Is that what that means?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051277_0051370 I will keep that in.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051370_0051605 and then the other
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051884_0051947 Some people don't know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051947_0052095 There are some people who don't do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052095_0052411 Yeah, you can see that they don't do that and it's the bottom of their list.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052523_0052876 Yeah!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052876_0053288 Some people have, and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time, yes no questions.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0053288_0053572 So which one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054120_0054797 That's the thing I wanted to know whether or not we because at the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five for all the top X
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054797_0055107 So you give it a number, you give it a top, whatever, for each person.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0055107_0056001 and then each meeting knows about all the different dialogue acts for each person in the meeting and then mount that that occurred.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056001_0056677 and we'll give you that in top order as well or you can just search for each specific dialogue act.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056677_0057267 that you have to search on in Bs and Ks rather than real words for the language.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057267_0057447 But I can change that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057447_0057616 So I don't know what we want to display
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057616_0057967 That's what I'm asking you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0058705_0058934 All's a lot, all's like 25.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0059098_0059276 I mean, do we care?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061270_0061732 I think we should have the global top five because each speaker's got a top whatever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061732_0062279 So just say one of the boxes just explains, says this is my top five Dior bags. For the speaker. For the speaker.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0062279_0062926 And then in the meeting you have what you can either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker's top five bets.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063063_0063146 either lies with their youth.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063146_0063342 but it would start to take up a lot of space.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063541_0063654 Well you could have, no you don't need that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063654_0063991 So he's because it's because it's a speaker window the speaker realization when it comes up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063991_0064404 So you've got the global one there, and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0064404_0064962 Ac yna'r top 5 yn y cyfarfod hwnnw, y cyfarfod global, ac yna'r rest. Yn amlwg, oes?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066048_0066086 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066256_0066714 Often the interesting ones don't occur. Things like joke don't occur very often.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066714_0067023 Well they do sometimes but they're not that common.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067023_0067170 One guy has top 5 turd
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067170_0067229 but I've been stoked.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067229_0067328 He's an undergird.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067328_0067396 Thanks, buddy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067426_0068442 This is good for browsing though. It's perfect. I mean that's sort of... It's actually a fun idea.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0068558_0068633 That's what's going on.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069233_0069679 It's taking me to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069860_0070409 That'd be quite good, wouldn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0072044_0072846 What percentage of the dialogue acts that he makes are jokes? In the meeting and globally, separately, so one's globally.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073056_0073347 I think most things are coded with it's all okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073347_0073526 A lot of them are coded with a Z which means they're labelled.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073526_0073733 So I just ignored that as well? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073733_0073790 says Lauren.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073946_0074059 and statement, which is what we're going to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074059_0074781 And also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something, so if I quote a joke to you, they separate that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074781_0075165 So they put they put the the dialogue X and then they put a double a colon and they put that aside
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075165_0075639 Ie, dim byd yn dda iawn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075639_0075772 Yeah, somebody else's joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075772_0076025 So yeah, you have to be original about your material.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0076025_0076404 I'm going to go and get that credit too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077423_0077500 Assgun
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077500_0077559 What the?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077673_0078155 Also ich finde, es macht ein bisschen Geräusche.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078155_0078195 I'm fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078195_0078339 But I think it's pretty much complete now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078339_0078429 So I'll do that tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078429_0078493 I'll just put it up there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078493_0078683 so you can start using that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0080941_0081261 No, just some school meeting and speaker. Oh, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081261_0081362 Well, I can change it if you want.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081863_0082071 Put it in a package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082181_0082258 Devam edelim.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082410_0082679 Well it doesn't seem to make any difference, I've never ever used driving packages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082679_0082941 That's a good one, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082941_0083101 It's in the same direction it works.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0083101_0083343 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0084289_0084638 You can double click on it. Well, no.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085342_0085510 Yeah, it was silly, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085510_0085735 Just borrow a little Microsoft GIF like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087174_0087240 and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087458_0087887 Where have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0089751_0089873 Yeah, you're gonna get ice cream.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0090954_0091434 Do you think we can do MSCs in Informatics?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0091434_0092082 Some balance.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093351_0093450 It's really easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093450_0094076 You do it in one of the, whatever the main window is, you do set gear force, set picture or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094076_0094130 Yeah!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094723_0094995 I think you just give it a file name and it tells it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095198_0095345 Yeah, yeah, just things in the comments.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095345_0095469 Is that an answer?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0096862_0097042 It even has some sound when it comes on and goes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097042_0097588 Welcome to the meeting room. Can we get sound on these machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097588_0097750 Non mais...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097750_0097841 I have to do it again.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0098317_0098701 No, but I think if you put headphones in it, it'll just play it just normally.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0099842_0099951 from times of Brexit.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0106575_0107074 I still can't make it on TNT from Jonathan. Are you serious? Maybe I'll try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107074_0107140 Yeah, you try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107140_0107443 If you make it right, well, so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0108805_0109267 It's a drama course. Practical drama.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0109598_0109694 Kosey
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0110835_0110927 Yeah, I think it was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111060_0111155 se vuelta
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111299_0112231 It was plainly generated by going to generate Java doc and just went oop, and then it brought up the tool head.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112554_0112756 It's good to know what methods are there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112756_0112904 without having to look at the source code.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112904_0112944 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0113268_0113370 Business learning.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114442_0114592 ぜあらる。 次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、次は、
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114592_0114681 I thought we said...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124630_0124769 or even after the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124769_0124899 Maybe it's just a dying door.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125011_0125070 سنمني معك
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125070_0125180 I probably will do it anyway.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126155_0126235 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126563_0126708 He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0132751_0132990 How many people have you had try and just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133265_0133358 Really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133528_0133914 No, it's gonna take forever and then you've got to analyse the results.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133914_0134088 I could think of like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0135705_0136941 Yeah, one computer scientist, one officer, and one dude off the street.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0137100_0137490 I just have two.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139417_0139544 2-2-2-3
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139544_0139677 Yeah, in two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140616_0140712 Zu wenig zu trinken.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140712_0140962 25th, 25th of... Oh right, so it's a... I thought it was Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141119_0141248 24th
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141940_0142114 Yeah, yeah, let's keep fighting. Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145149_0145491 We should try and have it done by then anyway I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145491_0145868 getting yeah that's probably tight otherwise to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146247_0146629 We should aim to be finished by Monday, this Monday coming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146629_0146885 A week? No, yeah, well basically for Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146885_0147214 Stop the evaluation pretty much straight away and then yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147364_0147545 Yeah, and then get um...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147696_0147872 We still write the report and everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147872_0147950 It's fine
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150022_0150518 That's easy compared to me. I mean, I'm not even worried about that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150813_0151225 and you must have your research for power.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151225_0151432 Is that in on the 18?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151652_0152009 How's yours? Not that it's weird.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199496_0199655 Niin, ja yössä saa jäädä.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199655_0200097 Yeah, you have to get the topics out instead of the segments.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0200097_0200142 You.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0204919_0205171 You're going to be able to do a global search for topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205569_0205767 Is that what you mean? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205965_0206035 네
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206073_0206264 Yeah I did think probably that way, cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206264_0206444 What? I didn't think we were going to bother with that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206444_0206625 哇 看你 傻眼
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206625_0206726 いや、大丈夫だよ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0207919_0208441 Well, we'll certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it. But we're not going to do that. At the very least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209642_0209821 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209821_0209934 I don't know if I can say that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209934_0210340 Well, yeah, even if I happen to manage to make it do some keywords.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210340_0210705 I don't think we can expect you to also come up with a search like that as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210877_0210998 If you're gonna answer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210998_0211183 Like, share, subscribe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211183_0211507 Yeah, I've created it myself as well, I would never do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211507_0211992 I did have a look at trying to create XML files.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211992_0212200 את התלורחת באה למשן מלאי
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212200_0212531 It's not as... It's as straightforward as writing in XML files.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212531_0212781 but it's organizing the segment.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212781_0213044 It just looks so complicated to get it from
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0213203_0214288 the um, from a plain text file back into organized by who, which speaker speaks what and how doing the segment. I think that was the stupidest thing they could ever, or I don't know, that's me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214288_0214589 I organise it by time, not by speaking.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214589_0214771 Alright.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214959_0215201 Co ty tam robisz?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218105_0218169 Here we go
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218169_0218366 Do we need another meeting this week?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0004201_0004336 I'm gonna sleep with it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0007493_0007587 Too slippery.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0009133_0009200 てみて
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011344_0011435 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011435_0011518 I'm just so very
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011518_0011696 No, that's just sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011754_0011982 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012309_0012442 Oh, right this way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012641_0012696 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012988_0013625 I didn't, I was trying to, I didn't have privileges to get in to update your file.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0013625_0014060 I would actually, I meant to send the email and then it just didn't get contacted.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014324_0014843 check the read write and then... Yeah, because I forget mine as well and it's just like, you know, every time I put something in there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014843_0015002 Um, see you guys, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015002_0015254 That was the main thing, so as soon as that's in, it'll be ready.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015254_0015416 I was making a complete little change at that moment.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015416_0015672 so those will be able to play one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015672_0016188 Still working on trying to get the topics in summary search implemented as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016188_0016478 So that's, that's for tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016478_0016680 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016680_0016966 I know it's real. Come on.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016966_0017340 I'm getting a better feel for all these night objects.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017545_0017761 It's just, it seems a little chaos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017761_0018272 Yeah. I know it's like if you're going to use this stuff later on in your life,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018272_0018612 You need to spend the time to invest and learn all about them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018612_0018924 Put's the minimum I can get. Get me what we need.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018924_0019419 It's like, I don't know. Unless I want to do something like this in the future.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019590_0019753 Alright.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019753_0020065 Dear.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020065_0020117 Huh?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020297 Anyways, so...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020934_0020962 What?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021106_0021208 I think if I get the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021208_0021506 I saw that and I'm just trying to remember if I did create it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021506_0022321 I think I was... because I was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago so that may be mine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022549_0022601 Oh really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022863_0022940 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022940_0023032 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023032_0023273 Yeah, it tastes hot against the anisysm. What's that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023273_0023456 Don't touch me!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023456_0023857 But yeah, that was just me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024270_0024714 I'm giving false impressions of what's happening.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024880_0025008 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025008_0025238 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025238_0025333 Always what I'm curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026232_0026377 I'll just record on that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026377_0026667 What did you actually do that much without? It's huge.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026667_0026774 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026774_0026982 So we probably won't have to worry about that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0027676_0027902 そうですね
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028023_0028142 See you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028142_0028236 How's everything else going?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0029902_0029991 No, więc...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030189_0030281 Do we want to keep that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030281_0030441 Like are we keeping that how that happens?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030441_0031056 it just prints everything out in the in the shell as well because it does everything and just kind of I guess that's its default behavior
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031056_0031237 Yeah, I mean...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031237_0031329 That's how you do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0032007_0032077 Oh, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0034811_0035151 I was more or less just playing with the things that I had to do directly with what I was doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035151_0035394 So I didn't take it for a full test.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035394_0035525 but you can do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035525_0035715 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0036863_0037115 Das ist das Wahligste, was da passiert ist.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038183_0038603 I think it is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038603_0038718 Better off with the eyes as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038718_0038753 I'll figure it out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038753_0038799 Ne yapayım?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0039372_0039778 Actually, can we run it on Windows?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040120_0040237 Nothing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040589_0040879 Were you using a GUI builder or just all from the board?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040968_0041094 Okay, and...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041310_0041492 That's nice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041892_0041987 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043448_0043867 Can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043867_0043909 Hehe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043909_0044253 No, I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0044253_0044625 I've done stuff like that before It really spit out
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0050822_0050856 C'est pas possible !
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0051559_0051733 Well, it's kind of boring, man.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0054913_0054979 It's for whatever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057759_0057819 I'm asking
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057819_0058348 I don't know if we have a choice so they can filter those out the top most comments
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0058348_0058783 just say okay show all or show only.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059359_0059504 I don't know, it doesn't really matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059504_0059733 If we just automatically filter these out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0061216_0061303 I think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067906_0067986 很遺憾
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067986_0068106 This is good for browsing though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068106_0068152 I'm scared!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068152_0068407 I mean that's sort of... It's like it was one idea that wasn't being...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068407_0068548 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068837_0068890 제발
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0069493_0069749 It's taking to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075358_0075462 Let's do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075513_0075642 Well it's not a girl joke anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077116_0077494 Okay, that's all true. So that's sort of implemented now? Yeah, that's all gone.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077764_0077829 Ja, das ist gut.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0078649_0079199 When I type in all, just recompile the browsers and just get that. You will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079280_0079699 Also, it uses my part as well. Yeah. Game search. Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0080103 Actually, do we have naming convention for our source files?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080103_0080384 just prefix them with a name. Yeah, I was thinking that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080690_0080798 That's sort of what I was doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080798_0081025 Like for your stuff do you have?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081163_0081249 Ok.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081369_0081562 It doesn't matter at this point.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081562_0081701 No, I was just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081701_0081885 Oh, I'm about to eat your stuff immediately.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082092_0082165 Yeah, that's true too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082282_0082406 Das ist meine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082770_0082939 Yeah, just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0084966_0085049 I'm sorry now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0085720_0085881 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086848_0086949 Yeah, I know, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086949_0086988 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0087619_0087884 I've never seen that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088088_0088254 Se precisar, já me conta.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088254_0088280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088280_0088700 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089258_0089791 This is probably basic, just text, font, and just something nice, something solid maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089791_0089834 可以了
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090132_0090202 I'm so cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090375_0090402 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090402_0090808 Anybody have any artistic talent?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091249_0091487 There's possibly something else down there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091487_0091840 I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091917_0092258 Let me go check to see if I can find any more.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0092806_0093153 How do you add that to the Java program?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093153_0093342 Is it just basic? I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093342_0093493 It's really easy, you do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094287_0094388 Put it behind.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094440_0094501 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094688_0094729 I'm a coward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095016_0095251 Also it'll do the automatic scrunching down if it's moving.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095251_0095320 Ty cienko.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0096153_0096712 Yes! You know it's a distinctive experience, I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097105_0097311 No
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097451_0097610 Can we get sound on these machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097654_0098357 Have you ever managed to play any sort of music on the Dice Machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098357_0098436 Einen guten Tag.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098676_0098758 Nombre creata.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098758_0098971 If
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0099427_0099484 BLEGH
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100612_0100744 You've a lot of idea
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100972_0101247 Okay, well this looks good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103314_0103778 And we're going to be trying to get the output from that. I don't know. Still haven't found out if it's sound.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103900_0104113 feasible to open up more than one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104113_0104744 As many NOM objects as we can for each meeting to do. Like we were going to figure that the ranking did make sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104744_0105104 like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105104_0105252 So we are going to look through only five of them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105252_0105882 just pick the top five to do the search since that's probably what we're looking for anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106821_0106975 Are you serious?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106975_0107255 Maybe I'll try Yeah, you try, I think you might get it right though
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0107377_0107864 Well, chuffed. Yeah, they'll be surprised because I'm bad at travel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0108383_0108461 Nie, słyszysz?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109005_0109126 Yeah, all this is just like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109126_0109300 practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109808_0110031 How do you guys find the documentation for Anxiety?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110161_0110304 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110304_0110440 I mean sometimes it's
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112103_0112218 Yeah, can do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112218_0112577 Well it's still a research platform.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112911_0113066 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113122_0113211 I'm just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113883_0114458 Did we have a date for when we actually want the system done?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0114458_0115163 I thought we said chicken. I thought we changed it to the tanth or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115163_0115809 Because the thing is, I mean, we can keep working on little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115809_0115932 to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0116104_0116933 So do we want to set an actual hard deadline? When exactly are we going to start the evaluation?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117358_0117427 I'm a health care provider.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117427_0117920 I guess we can still come up with test cases or whatever for the people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117920_0118139 come up with scenarios. Best shot. That sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118139_0118504 I mean that's fairly straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118504_0118703 I'm actually tired.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118703_0118805 對啊 對
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118805_0119034 Just brainstorm, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120063_0120141 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120773_0120899 Can work on it a bit more.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121052_0121445 I've got my D&LG presentation on Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121445_0121759 Too much now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0122268_0122340 Yeah, I think so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123133_0123383 Well, probably have to talk to Steve at some point as well, I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123383_0123515 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123676_0123949 I'll probably just have a regular Tuesday meeting with him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123949_0124267 We could send him an email but I don't know if he's around.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124267_0124755 He was out of line this week, is that right? I think that's why we didn't have the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124939_0125003 Hmm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125180_0125261 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125261_0125430 Although, do we really want the answer?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125430_0125786 So if you don't ask, push it off.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127258_0127312 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127630_0127793 Alright, cheers!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127793_0127917 We're looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129036_0129224 Yeah, if they have time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129224_0129346 Sorry, smiling people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129674_0129833 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130060_0130210 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130210_0130370 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130898_0131310 Actually, some other friends of mine in different programs might be more willing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131310_0131482 Have more of a break.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131482_0131772 So then I get a range of types of people as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131772_0132330 Like not like highly computer, like not, you know, Lennox literate.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132330_0132565 I think that might be good as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132565_0132750 So the wider range of people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132950_0133165 I think like three or four maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133165_0133775 That would be good. Really? I was thinking of like 10. No, it would take forever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133872_0133975 Zotac!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133975_0134636 I did an HCI course a while ago and that's just, that's what they, there's three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134718_0134790 And I was fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134790_0135144 then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135305_0135407 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135407_0135572 We don't want it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135862_0136947 What did of the speed?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137425_0137628 I just got four.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137628_0137769 I'm gonna call him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137769_0137988 But if he finds them, then that's cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137988_0138094 which it means to people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138094_0138215 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138516_0138578 Oh, right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0139203_0139271 I'm nearly two weeks pregnant.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140242_0140610 I thought evaluation may be for the report.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140610_0140752 Das ist eine Mordhandelung.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140752_0140882 2015. Oh right, so-
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140882_0140970 I thought that was funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140970_0141080 That's what I understand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141247_0141500 I thought you said 20 steps.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141500_0141952 Even though it's Good Friday. It's not Good Friday!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142066_0142163 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142163_0142403 Easter too. Wow, it's not a good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142418_0142656 No! Well it wasn't originally on there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142656_0143082 Well I'm sure on the website it says Thursday. Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143247_0143567 So that gives us two days to do the evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143567_0143766 No, we call you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143766_0143830 Не надо, урка!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144144_0144408 I didn't think so, necessarily.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144408_0144537 I wouldn't assume.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144537_0144643 But we should ask them to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145641_0145965 Yeah, that's probably tight otherwise. It's a good target.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145965_0146120 It's a good one. Yeah, you might.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147092_0147205 Straight away and then get...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147902_0148058 Cheers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148058_0148276 It's just funny to have it finished by Monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148276_0148594 because after Monday I'm pretty much free for about a week or so. Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148594_0149073 It's like, if we had a bit more time...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149456_0149558 Oh, the next one, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149558_0149960 Can't get free after this Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149960_0150359 Nice pizza. That's easy compared to normal.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150359_0150594 I mean I'm not even worried about that. Because I don't have anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150724_0150827 I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150827_0150890 なんでいます?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151378_0151464 You didn't start yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151464_0151692 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151692_0151764 Pazuz.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151929_0152096 Ha ha!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0152773_0153143 If that was us, then not him. Yeah, that's why I'm trying to think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153143_0153293 I like how it has a sucking
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153647_0153757 Yeah, Thursday, 24.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154007_0154164 Deadline for submission of plan.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154502_0154676 And now you can end of lectures.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155209_0155380 Ça tombe fort ça.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155884_0156315 Just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156649_0156753 We should have it that way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156753_0156839 Danke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157128_0157274 But it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157274_0157747 Is that a part of the demonstration, that they want that information? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0159586_0159628 B O O M
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160781_0160938 I'm through with a few little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160938_0161185 Just made some comments at the last meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161185_0161535 Just generally how it all integrates, blah blah blah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161535_0161657 Do it now!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161997_0162216 I'd expect somewhere between 10 and 15 pages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162406_0162725 Although it's 50% of the mark I think, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162725_0162768 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163174_0163343 Well, we have a better time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163473_0163524 It's gonna be good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0164978_0165201 Just to fine tune in your detail.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165315_0165359 more faggots
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165717_0166013 Yeah, that could easily be like every six pages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169046_0169143 I'm tripping.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169143_0169262 No, no big rush.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169501_0169604 Although just to get it out of the way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169604_0169952 so I'm trying to remember to do that tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0171732_0172201 Just basic, pretty much like the intro. Do you want to do the intro instead?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0172201_0172565 Just sort of like Google type thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0173517_0173764 And I was just like, I'm not gonna do this. Probably.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174233_0174429 It doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174429_0174744 That's the other big part.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174744_0175073 I mean, how to get that communication between the two different kinds of windows.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175461_0175946 Because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175946_0176441 That was why I was sort of deciding to get the three pains in there instead of just the one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0176699_0177347 Yeah, so there's a couple of those little things. Yeah, I do. Beautiful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0177347_0177529 Yeah, and makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178574_0178779 Is that how it works in the islands?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178779_0179183 and like the other windows, like various like, yeah, different topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0179927_0180420 If you have like a particular window that you want me to mimic, it's behavior.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180420_0180825 and just find it in the program and just say, okay, just have this one does it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180825_0181051 So if it's like the topic window or the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0181663_0182241 So I can sort of trace back and figure out what objects they are and what do you...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0187581_0187863 So one left click just highlights.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188300_0188413 I'll just let him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188570_0188695 the transcript or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0189392_0189561 You can see you could just-
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0190694_0190785 That should be possible.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191221_0191242 BOOM
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191550_0191944 Although, yeah, this is actually different from how we printed up here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191944_0192057 like if we're doing a global search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192057_0192623 then we are going to do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192623_0192899 And then we'll either multi-select or...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192899_0193337 choose the one we want to actually do this I think multi-select would make more sense. What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193337_0193727 Well, just if there's like three of the top meetings like we said before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193727_0194086 language, looking for the word language and get the highest rated ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194086_0194615 Actually look for the terms we're not loading it on fall 76.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194615_0195308 So the results from that will narrow down what we're going to use for the local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195308_0195571 And we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195571_0195821 Allez, puis qu'il... Oh, ouais, c'est bon, je m'y met, ok.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195821_0196372 So it will be a bit different from how that is right now. When we do the blood search at least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197254_0197407 Yes. If not, you can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197407_0197508 Good day.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0201665_0201959 So that we search two different...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0202422_0202634 What's actually going on?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203017_0203143 Yeah, local anyways, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203143_0203227 Now that's easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203227_0203393 Yeah, would you make that? That would be...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203393_0203597 That's quite...stressful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206489_0206636 Well, it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206636_0206734 Evet, hazır.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206901_0207310 Are we bothering with our topic stuff?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207310_0207511 Or is that sort of like our own topic segment?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207511_0207760 Like since we can't do the labeling and all the rest.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207760_0207915 We are still doing our topic segment.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207915_0208053 Well, what's that? You are. Do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0208316_0209096 But we're not going to do that. At the very least, we won't be doing a global search on the topics for our topics, since they don't have labels.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209233_0209491 All the label ones? Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209491_0209673 Get off of people, dudes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209673_0209740 Power out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210577_0210642 Who's looking at us?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210642_0210701 Tak.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210701_0210871 Although it would be kind of straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210871_0211092 If you're creating it, it's not a problem.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218435_0218498 Probably not.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218498_0218791 I mean just get work done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218791_0218984 I think that's what I've gotta do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001099_0001453 We're not allowed to get in the light, so...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001887_0002029 Unfortunately, because of the
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002237_0002381 I'm not supposed to be standing up there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002986_0003229 Yeah, good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008190_0008382 Hello everybody.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008382_0009196 I'm Sarah, the project manager and this is our first interview. Surprisingly enough.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009196_0009474 Okay, this is our agenda.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009568_0010193 We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better, feel more comfortable with each other.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010193_0010814 Then we'll go do chill training, talk about the project plan.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010814_0011589 discuss our own ideas and everything. And we've got 25 minutes to do that, as far as I can understand.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0011762_0012154 Now we're developing a remote control, which you probably already know.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012154_0012699 We want it to be original, something that people haven't thought of.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012699_0013201 it's not out in the shops, trendy, appealing to a wide market.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0013201_0014283 but not a whole lot of metal. And user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches, should be able to use it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014283_0014958 Okay, first is the functional design. This is where we all go off and do our individual work.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014958_0015940 what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, what effect the product has to have, and how it's actually going to do that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0015940_0016094 and conceptual design.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0016231_0016780 what we're thinking, how it's going to go, and then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017038_0017203 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017203_0018410 We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard. I'll go first. And sum up the characteristics of that animal.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0018883_0019207 Okay. Stay safe, guys.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0021146_0021197 Oh
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024322_0024433 I can't breathe.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024789_0025060 And I'm going to ask you to guess in Prince Terry that's Whisper of the Tiger.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025453_0025724 and I see that as majestic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025989_0026225 and any kind of constant.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0027231_0027542 Now, who would like to go next?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028757_0028966 I'm scared for her.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028966_0029010 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0035001_0035109 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0037384_0037686 Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039399_0039492 Obrigado.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039631_0039980 It was in a class?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0042011_0042095 That's lovely.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0043985_0044177 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0046109_0046216 Technical help.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0048966_0049134 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0050119_0050466 Right, not a seagull.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0055448_0055515 I saved you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056312_0056546 That was fun. I need to...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056546_0057464 Finance-wise, we've got a selling price at 25 euros, which I don't actually know what that is in pounds at all.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0057464_0057532 Any ideas?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058385_0058512 Yeah, that's it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058638_0058798 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0059098_0059592 I think so, I think so. I'd be able to pull it up or I could put it in the shared folder.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0060813_0060929 So I suppose later it depends.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061351_0061782 Yeah, production costs are £12.50.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061913_0062426 half of the selling price is taken up by building it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0062426_0062944 and profit aim is 15 million euros which is a...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0063129_0063642 Yeah, yes. Yeah, I presume so.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0064913_0065029 and everyone using the technology.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0065357_0066222 target group. Yes, yes. I don't think we have to, I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0066222_0066970 making that key point, just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067520_0067829 What are your experiences with remote controls?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067829_0068347 I mean, I've got, we got, um, we had three videos.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0068347_0069167 TV and sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069167_0069939 that you program each of your things into, but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to reprogram it every now and again.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069939_0070270 I think it was quite cheapy as well.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070270_0070483 But that was quite good, the fact that you could...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070596_0070891 You have six remote controls sitting in front of you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073498_0073730 Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073730_0075176 I mean, and you don't want to, I hate, I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the tally text button or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0075743_0077073 when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions when you can do sound or options, kind of recording.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077073_0077283 things like that inside it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077283_0077979 Because it doesn't make, when you pick it up, it doesn't make it really complicated to look at. It's obvious what you're doing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081235_0081365 What about the older generation?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081365_0081509 Not by granny and granddad's.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081615_0082363 My granddad can answer his mobile phone but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0082812_0083151 I don't think they take things. Yeah. My grandad thought she better leave.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0084120_0084324 Yeah, I got some of those.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0086430_0087174 I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that have a Windows based running system.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087295_0087683 I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the first place.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087683_0088287 I had not got a new one but my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0088438_0088517 That's just me.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0090577_0090750 if they take the same option as me.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091369_0091737 I brought back kind of a dual function.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091737_0092964 in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, program things and also a menu to go into with obvious pictures
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0092964_0093488 obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0094848_0095316 I think that's a cost thing. I don't know how much we're going to know about.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0095602_0095807 Yes, that's important.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0097097_0097935 Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio. Rwy'n gobeithio.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0098120_0098951 I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102232_0102399 I broke my arm.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102504_0102689 I mean the Sky Remote controls and everything.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102689_0103258 They're kind of molded and look a bit different and the Tail US remote controls are silver plastic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103258_0103865 which looks a bit smarter. So yeah, I guess that's tough you can think about.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103865_0104156 Okay, so let's break it up there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104313_0104416 So see you in half an hour.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104776_0104904 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002515_0002683 I've got a city script on.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002912_0003048 Yeah, good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0003130_0003339 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0004975_0005318 I'm a fly, isn't I?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0030638_0030720 a kind of dog.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0035651_0036214 Rwy'n gobeithio y byddwch chi'n rhoi mewn cyfle ar y ddewis.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0037680_0037894 I think it's astoundingly good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0042144_0042234 I hate you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0044316_0044795 I'm very impressed with your artistic skill.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0044795_0045085 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0045400_0045694 I'll hold it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0045797_0046057 Oh dear.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0046538_0046851 Hopefully that'll stay on 200%
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0046851_0047088 Yeah!
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0047441_0047935 Yn ôl i'r cyfan, rydw i'n mynd i'w wneud gyda'r cyfan hefyd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0048126_0048468 and he doesn't look like what I want him to be.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0048877_0049141 No, I'm just kidding.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049290_0049778 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049778_0049996 My dreadful work, the worst yet.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049996_0050809 It's meant to be an eagle. Right, not a seagull. It could have been a seagull. I never thought it would be a seagull.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0050809_0051149 And there you go, again I'm blinking on my feet, goodness.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051149_0051612 I suppose they're also independent, I'll have to put that on again.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051612_0051866 Ah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052028_0052492 Independent. Did you say they're good at golf? Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052492_0052624 Ego.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052691_0052920 Oh right, I'm not good at that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052920_0053660 I'll do the quite free stoative. Flying around everywhere. Do you know anything?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054142_0054715 and birth prey, you do. Intrepid.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054715_0054953 Hehe.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0055366_0055677 I think I have to go to sleep now. I'm gonna be okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058488_0058597 Thank you for watching!
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058837_0058954 Should we be making notes of this?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058954_0059174 We can just refer to the flutter, can't we? I think so.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0059174_0059228 I think so.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0060809_0061392 I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price or is it going to make our product look a cheapy cheapy option?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063037_0063120 in our first year.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063810_0064823 You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups, just we're not focusing on business markets.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0064823_0065111 any particular thing, it's everyone, use it to everyone.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0065341_0065540 Big target group. Yes, yes.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071292_0071717 My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071717_0072244 not doing any tampering with it and programming, using it to program TV videos and things.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072244_0072768 but basically on, off, volume, up and down, channel 1, 2, that basic function.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072768_0073605 I don't think I could go any further with it than that. So, I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Yeah, the main, that's the main thing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0075081_0075529 And symbols that you don't necessarily understand. Symbols you're meant to understand.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0076852_0076898 She's gone.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0077978_0078326 Actually that just raises a point, I wonder what our design people think.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078326_0078704 But you know on a mobile phone you can press a key and it gives you a menu?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078704_0079448 It's got a menu display. I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful. So you've got a little LCD display.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0080380_0080592 with menus.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0082379_0082797 Can he program his remote controller? Is he basic with that too?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083464_0083927 So that's the problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with? Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083927_0084464 That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation of mums. That's another issue we tackle that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0089871_0090564 Is it possible that for the older generation you could have an extra button that you press for large print, like you do in large print books?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0090564_0091178 It displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0093518_0094012 The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094012_0094353 You can have a flip-top remote control so that when you flip over the top
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094353_0094756 You can have a bigger screen in the flipover.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095678_0095860 Yes, it might have his skull.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095969_0096635 And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone. It can still be lightweight plastic, you know?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0096635_0096916 something that's easily molded and produced.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0096916_0097245 Sorry, I'm treading on your terrace, Rikard.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0100506_0100574 Sorry about that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0100916_0101130 Sure. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101370_0101720 I mean it doesn't have to be that bad.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101720_0101945 That was my main point, you don't have to use a metaphor.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101945_0102210 I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper. I've seen it with wood.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0102210_0102441 I agree.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0104642_0104829 Do we go back to the room?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0031569_0031739 Oh yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035348_0035555 Let's do that thing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035911_0036174 Oh, that's my top. It's definitely got a chain.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0036174_0036765 Okay, the dog is itchy
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037143_0037529 and also my drawing skill isn't that great. Well as you can see across
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037960_0038448 Okay, now I'm going to have to change what it was originally, because that looks like a beak.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039041_0039795 Crocodile? It can't be a crocodile. It can't be a crocodile.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039795_0040627 Well it was, it was a, firstly it was an attempt at T-Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a perc.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0042120_0042597 Yeah, and I think I'm the spot of thanks it is.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0042812_0043022 Uh, scary.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0043248_0043437 Earth's strong.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0043874_0044199 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0044523_0044668 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0049740_0049998 My dreadful was the worst yet.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0050176_0050322 Right. That's it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0051987_0052095 They could have gone.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0052430_0052863 Yeah. Ego. Ego. Oh right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0057511_0057766 It's a... It's a mic joke.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0058085_0058757 Yeah, yeah, same, I know. So, yeah, that's £17. £17. Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0059419_0060321 Having said that though, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market at the moment, they're about £20 anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0060321_0060809 So yeah, we had fun.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0070110_0070188 Yes, that might be.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0070518_0070672 You saw the ones that have
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0071124_0071332 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0082937_0083405 Yeah, my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext, so...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0084373_0084958 Yeah, well it just needs to be, as long as it's sort of self intuitive and you can work out.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085098_0085279 Why everything is dying. Because I'm in.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085279_0086194 menus on new phones now they've got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0086443_0086588 I don't know how.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0087018_0087069 Oh yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0088518_0089370 Yeah, I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50 how much of an excellent screen you get.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0089370_0089931 You'd have to keep it down to a black and white LCD. Is it possible?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0097068_0097179 No.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0098880_0099666 Just a quick thing about what you were saying about it doesn't need to be fashionable.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0099666_0100524 I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the we put the fashion into electronics.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0100524_0101484 So I think the whole design thing might be quite... I mean you can still have plastic and it look quite good but...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0000037_0000176 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0006420_0006633 What the fuck?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008050_0008166 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008322_0008403 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0025591_0025625 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0027508_0027545 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028514_0028661 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028908_0029068 Oh, yeah!
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029068_0029332 You can't just come in here.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029332_0029602 Maybe the best run from the next one.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031347_0031914 It's actually sitting, so... It's sitting, it's not standing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031914_0032186 Okay, I see it as one thing, it's very supportive.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032413_0032773 It's your best friend in you. You can talk to your dog, it can be your best friend too.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032773_0033136 It doesn't discriminate between you based on what you are.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0033136_0034096 Second is Loyal And third thing is Intuition
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0034096_0035106 Dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0035106_0035147 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0036433_0036784 Okay, I got dog itchy
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0050178_0050267 Right? That's it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057676_0057871 У нас Майк в зёртвах
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057871_0058150 1.4 would make a lot of noise.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0061754_0061959 Okay, pretty good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0063639_0063710 BOOM
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0069149_0069222 and
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0070861_0071104 You want to integrate everything into one
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0075518_0075806 when there
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0078708_0078774 They all manage.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079289_0079360 little mouse.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079446_0080057 I was thinking of the same lines. Instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user,
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080057_0080603 Maybe have an LCD display or something like that, like a mobile? With menus. With menus.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080603_0081203 And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0081521_0081896 My granddad can answer his own question.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0094604_0094666 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095091_0095738 You don't know how much we're going to know by... It might save up a bit of space. Instead of looking bulky, it might look small.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095738_0095924 but it might have its cost implications.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0104805_0104838 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000818_0000982 Can't play.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000982_0001080 SKATE FLAT!
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003704_0003883 Alright, here it is.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003883_0003972 Action.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0005545_0005586 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0006681_0007420 Right, okay, um, this is our second meeting, and I might be a bit out of place.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0007420_0007886 Right, our agenda for today... Do you want us to give you a second?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008127_0008353 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008593_0008870 I'll go over what we decided last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0009263_0009912 We decided upon a universal control, one hand set for all to be good ears.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0010181_0011216 that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0011216_0012023 We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, we put fashion in electronics, that kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0012023_0012947 our budget would have to try not to reflect our budget that we might
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013141_0013633 I have a bit of... Oh, you can see it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013633_0014340 dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014485_0014869 wanted to look uncluttered, undaunting to the customer.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014869_0015936 We discussed a flip-open design, reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming, things like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016324_0016680 Three presentations I've got written here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016866_0017062 Shall we hear from Marketing first?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017503_0017732 No, that's fine, that's fine. Okay, yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017907_0017982 and her hair.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019400_0019512 M.S.N.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019596_0019726 Action at home.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0033828_0033873 Ouais.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0052766_0053017 Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053017_0053235 Would you like to continue from there?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053591_0053854 Maybe with that too.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0059477_0059630 嗯
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0061274_0061355 Oh, okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077551_0077886 I think we'll try to spray it at the end.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077886_0078435 Okay, so if anyone wants to write something down, they want to be at the end.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0078855_0079091 This one.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0079260_0079339 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080268_0080336 What?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080959_0081103 Let me check it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084130_0084197 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084490_0084543 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0103869_0104058 Right, um...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0104172_0104485 We have new project requirements.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0105110_0106034 We're not going to be using teletext. Partly consumers consider it outdated with the internet now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106240_0106856 Our control is only going to be for TV, it's not going to be combined control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106856_0107844 which limits all of the different things, it limits the cost for us but it also makes it easier to understand programming.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0108057_0109180 says for TV only so looks like it's just yeah I think maybe sky and things like that might be incorporated into it but
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109419_0109550 I don't know what you think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109550_0109781 It just said, for TV only.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109781_0110213 I mean general TV controls do do video as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0110444_0110888 I mean, well, all sorts of things. You get combined TV and videos, don't you?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0112245_0112700 I think we assume it's still got play and stop functions and programming.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0118844_0119020 Yeah, but I'm on time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120074_0120646 We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120646_0121783 So I think when we can take a cheaper option, which still does the same kind of thing, because it is something... It needs to be... The thing that you...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0121865_0122367 used to find it needs to be something that you don't lose. So you were saying whistling.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122367_0122886 Maybe on the TV, you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122886_0123385 You go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps and you're like, okay, it's everything.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123385_0123711 something like that but that sounds a lot cheaper to me.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123800_0124766 The third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0124766_0125253 So we want logo, we want
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125490_0125856 fashionable, trendy, I mean what you were talking about with the marketing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125931_0126371 and people paying more for it to look good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0126492_0126781 We need to focus on that as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132038_0132750 What about, you were talking about the buttons. The controls that are coming out now have
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132750_0133469 rubber buttons not tiny little big rubber buttons but want that I mean because we got to make it original
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133620_0133736 What about...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133869_0134201 You know with the touch screen computers?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0134432_0135394 So it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button, which shouldn't wear out as much either.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135518_0135840 You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135840_0137075 I think that might appeal, I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking young office people, trendy.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137206_0137531 But quite...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137531_0138564 easily labeled so that anyone can say, oh yeah, that's obvious what that's for, and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0140284_0140357 There's physics
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0145256_0146158 I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146158_0146540 or they can make it bigger or they can change features slightly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146796_0147715 It's going to be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing and not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0151286_0151974 or a speech recognition, which is extremely expensive. I think that's the only way that you can avoid
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0152084_0152177 that kind of issue.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0154752_0155002 We are talking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155203_0155496 the type of company that we're working for as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155496_0156520 that they want it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy, and you wouldn't automatically associate that with the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0156520_0157418 Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0157418_0157983 But I don't think we're focusing on that. I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0158124_0158361 business class type people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160471_0160942 Okay, so... the remote control functions...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160942_0161612 We've got the TV, we've got the video. Now there's...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0161750_0162392 I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of program details. Video plus. Yes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0162580_0163755 We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that. I always found that really easy when I discovered it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0163884_0164486 because you've got your general record anyway so if there's a program on you want to put a record on.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164486_0164979 That's fine. But if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164979_0165402 You put the number in and it's just a number. It's not a date. It's not time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0165402_0165877 It's not channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just number.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166423_0166641 You've already got the numbers for typing it anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166940_0167575 is after if you look in the newspaper or TV guide or any TV guide there's a...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0167575_0169104 six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at 10 o'clock on the 17th, things like that so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169104_0169455 And it has been around for a long time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169712_0170288 No, it's not. But I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0172221_0172299 Okay, so...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0179443_0180041 The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your TV's not doing it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0180125_0180592 taking your TV and your controller and saying, look, this is what I'm doing. It's not working. What should I do?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181366_0181542 I think so. Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181827_0181972 instruction manuals
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181972_0182307 But I mean, there's customer service.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0182307_0183125 there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charges.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0183125_0183634 Just no extra person have to walk to a shop on the high street.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0184469_0185430 But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little variety and lots and lots of pages. People love reading them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185430_0185816 It does, you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185816_0186123 So that should be something we think about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186123_0186346 What other functions?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186346_0186957 We need, I'm not sure if we need a design decision now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186957_0187714 But we should think about... because you've got the dilemma between... Oh, the batteries, that's what I was thinking about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0187714_0187922 What about phone batteries? What kind of batteries are there?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0188854_0189772 Well they last quite a long time and if you had, the thing that you get with mobile house phones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0189772_0190169 you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or at night or something like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190169_0190674 but it doesn't really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time once it's charged.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190674_0191003 and something like that should reduce the size of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0191820_0192107 Yeah, it could be on that. Yeah, on that as well. Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0192773_0192946 rechargeable with a docking station.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193074_0193261 so the recharge will be here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193952_0194291 Yes, which is cheaper in London as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194291_0194770 and the shape got trendy.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194770_0195498 I don't want a big box with lots of things. You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0195498_0196249 because then you have got the repetitive strain, no matter how much you try and make it simple.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0196609_0196676 DING DONG
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0197718_0197875 Okay, so we've got a flip screen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0201381_0201563 Because it's kind of loaded to your head anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0202640_0203026 Can you look into the company logo?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0203150_0204079 things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204079_0204130 I mean...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204322_0205260 For example, if it was a sea or something like that, you could have it in a vague C shape that opens up kind of like a shell.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0205260_0205875 or something, something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite easily.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0206040_0206644 obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that's there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0208341_0208598 Well, we need to think about how it is going to look different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212165_0212769 Or you could do different, like you get with mobile phones, different fashes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212769_0213100 You could have different kind of casings.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0213100_0213867 So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0216498_0216776 Right, I think we have to round it up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0218236_0219067 That was in cutting down the number of functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0219067_0219618 making it simpler, so instead of having lots of things to update.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0220670_0221444 It kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221444_0221589 doing a good job.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221657_0222602 Yes, it could be an advertisement feature rather than a design feature. You know, draw attention to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0222671_0223557 and also paid lip service in the instruction manual. Because it's very simple, so putting it down in words should be helpful.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0224964_0225675 We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0226198_0226844 And we've talked about there being an alarm or something, a beeping from being lost.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227005_0227308 Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227308_0228085 There aren't going to be that many functions incorporated into it, so it should be fine. And the instruction manual.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228085_0228384 I don't know if we deal with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228594_0228670 I think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228984_0229266 Yeah. And different from what's out there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0229266_0229414 Yeah, that's us.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230012_0230375 I think you might get guidance but...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230550_0230564 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230717_0230976 instruction manuals because there tends to be a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0231160_0231851 demonized thing, everyone's got a big pile of them but no one really uses them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0232414_0232555 Yes, right.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233087_0233150 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233342_0233739 I think you can email me if there's any more questions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233929_0234196 I know I'll be able to know answer.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0004768_0004918 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0008031_0008152 Uh, no, that's okay. Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0017101_0017584 Is it okay if I postpone that until later? I just want to get access to a little bit more information. No, that's fine.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0031970_0032302 Can I interject to ask a question? Yes, sure.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0032302_0032675 You think you should play it back to the sword or the cannon? I have no idea if you-
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0033595_0033876 those batteries in.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0034157_0034256 I'm just wondering
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0051715_0052358 That's a very important point, it came up in our market research findings too, so I'll confer to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060486_0060728 It's good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060904_0061000 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080309_0080569 I've got to keep this here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080569_0080653 country.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080875_0081185 I have to, I have to, I just did.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081185_0081594 I'm going to push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081594_0081740 💥💥💥
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081740_0082067 Yep.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083136_0083235 Is that okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083679_0083990 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084171_0084387 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084563_0085725 Okay then, I'm going to look at the functional requirements from a marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0085725_0086149 So that's where we started. We used our usability app.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086149_0086670 the company's usability lab. We did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086670_0087219 male and female, all age groups from 15 upwards and we observe them in the lab.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087219_0087626 Just their general use of the remote control. You can see we had 100 subjects there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087633_0088097 Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088097_0088814 The overall thing which I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088814_0089076 so it has obvious design implications there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089076_0089559 we found that 75% of users find most remote controls ugly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089695_0090332 80% would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. We were quite surprised by that finding.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0090332_0091220 But that's quite a high proportion of our international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091220_0091790 Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user overall.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091790_0092588 For example, you can see below there, 75% of users zap a lot. So you've got your person sunk back in the sofa, channel hopping.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092588_0092783 So again, there's power implications there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092792_0093454 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons, so again a big design issue there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0093454_0094252 And possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0094690_0095591 The biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier. Remote controls are often lost in the room.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0095591_0096272 was slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing. 50% were particularly frustrated by that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0096272_0097238 34% of people said they take too much time to learn to use. And I think that ties in with the previous finding of people only using 10% of the buttons.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0097238_0097521 that just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0097607_0098356 Slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0098356_0098896 You know, the small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0098896_0099689 The vast majority of the 35 and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0099689_0100431 Again, that was to aid, I think, in when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100431_0100548 Something we didn't put to them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100548_0101364 which I'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again until we find it or a flashing light.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101496_0101820 That trend reverses in the older age groups.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101820_0102050 to 30 fans and unders who would like those two features.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102050_0102645 So that kind of evens out 35 to 45 and in the older age group it kind of reverses, they're not so bothered with this.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102724_0103167 I had marvelous tables and things that I could show you but I think I'll just keep it simple
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0103167_0103614 If there's any more information I can email you extra details, is that okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0107683_0108058 Felly, a allwn ni ddifrindio fideo gyda'r cwbl hir?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0108448_0108535 is just.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0109768_0109931 Would that mean General TV could...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0110866_0111006 Is the end that you've got
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0113429_0114281 We didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about 10% of the buttons.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114281_0114818 I think that those did tend to be the basic channel hopping things that offer the video fast forwarding.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114818_0115453 so on. I think it's of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a knife.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0115453_0115669 So I don't know if that's something we need to...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0116582_0117240 I just called up that table there. We asked those two questions. The table relates to both questions that we didn't differentiate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0117240_0117928 Would you prefer an LCD screen that's a multi-function remote? And would you pay more for speech recognition and remote control?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0117928_0118404 So you can see how the yes-no sort of varies across the age group.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0118404_0118899 A substantial number of don't know in the older age group. I think that's just general fear of new technology.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0119631_0119703 It'll allow for
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0123366_0123469 So something like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0126734_0127142 Wow. Further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0127142_0127782 It's going to be different for a 15 year old than somebody who's 60. And also across the world of reaming international market.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0127782_0128591 What is attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African? I don't know. You get the idea.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0128591_0128772 that's going to vary around the world.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0128772_0129154 At the end of the day, the engineering design is one thing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0129154_0129967 It's the user interface design that may, and the sort of, you know, fashionable aspect of it, we might have to change for different markets around the world.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0137001_0137251 With appeal to sections of the Lord Adel.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0138337_0138495 generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0146528_0146951 The internal engineering design has got to remain the same. It's going to be the same, so we need to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0147756_0148224 I'm concerned when you read the RSI issue, again repetitive strain injury.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148224_0148581 I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148581_0148982 I think that is still a kind of question mark issue, how we deal with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148982_0149485 RSI tends to be caused by repetitive small movements.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0149607_0150179 I really can't get my head around this one, this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0151052_0151322 around the change of agenda that becomes...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0152211_0152875 Do we have to initially, looking at the findings here, focus on
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153020_0153426 younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153426_0153757 Do we really have to go for everyone right away?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0154265_0154787 When we're drawing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people, young people, trying to be...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158340_0158878 I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158878_0159335 you want to not waste money, not be profligate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159538_0159772 in a focus on where the idea will be taken up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159772_0160276 First, it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0166569_0167039 I'm not going to cross that function but it sounds wonderful.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0167960_0168027 Alex.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0171461_0171636 Excellent.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172320_0172808 Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me? I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172808_0173473 But just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups that occurs to majority producers on mobile phones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0173473_0174307 That's kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with their design features. Chain companies like Carphone Warehouse
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174307_0174740 You can pop in any time with a phone that you've bought for them if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it for you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174740_0175078 or the company, you can use their telephones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175078_0175985 Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175985_0176511 If they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, you know, which button is it I press for this?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0176511_0176914 That's a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180470_0180828 What should I do if it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180828_0181323 But I mean, if there were any more, or it would be absolutely definite, it's only going to be for TV and video.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0181323_0181622 Yeah, I mean...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0184190_0184550 Not with such simple functions, because we're focusing on that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185334_0185586 It puts people off reading them. It does. You just put it in a drawer.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185840_0186028 That should be something we think about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196261_0196662 And we don't want, I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196662_0197058 brown things with the same coloured buttons all crowding on the surface.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0197058_0197764 We definitely, an obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles. We don't want that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0200379_0200552 Then I'm going to keep connecting curved up units of the
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0206780_0206923 That bit
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0208703_0209017 I think that's... that sounds a really attractive idea.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209017_0209569 I've never come across anything like that before. And that opens out into your flip top.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209569_0209833 then it's nice to have, you can make it lightweight plastic.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209833_0210338 nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210338_0210880 That's going to take care of some of the additive strain injury. We've had a lot of it, I would think.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210880_0211441 I think it's a really nice idea. Plus, you can get, even though we're using plastic,
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0211441_0212121 You can still, I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic. You can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213830_0213973 less chance of it being lost to a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213973_0215162 it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's going to go down the souchra. People might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament and they're not going to lose it so much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0215162_0215553 It's easy but nice to handle. Yeah maybe they could come and do it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0216798_0217196 Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements so I haven't missed anything?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0217196_0218132 So it's no teletext, it's only for TV and by implication video. Corporate image should be incorporated in their remote control. Something about video plus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219412_0219960 I think she won't be impressed with programming if it comes up on the LCDA reminder about using VideoPlus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219960_0220091 so that they will look at the guidance.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0220232_0220665 Or is this nothing to do with the project requirements? Is this just an add-on feature?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0221346_0221738 that. So it's like doing a programming feature. Yes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223519_0223739 And they'll be chargeable batteries.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223739_0224192 Was there anything else there that we... new project requirements?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225709_0225935 That's not at the moment a requirement, it's something we're looking at.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225935_0226310 Yes, so we come around to market research at some point.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229455_0229731 What would you specifically like marketing to look at for the next meeting?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229731_0230004 Archelogist of General Ilka Ongyesi
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232273_0232423 Ops, krzyż nie wpadł.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232530_0232698 I love Star Wars too.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017650_0017791 Okay, yeah, I'll go first.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017791_0017931 Can I grab the...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019155_0019224 You can press the button.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019224_0019332 超值費
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019684_0019789 No.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0020998_0021062 You
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021250_0021849 This is the working design presented by me, the industrial design maestro in there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021996_0022501 Okay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint, see?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022501_0022885 The first thing the questioner asks is what are we trying to design?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022885_0023358 A device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change the state of the world.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023358_0023844 whether that be the power or the channel or the volume.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023844_0024692 Everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliances sending the signal to.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0024903_0025738 So I decided I'd have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0025738_0026006 but although we will want to be taking
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0026148_0027208 ideas from other people, we want to make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that, well it wasn't really my area because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027266_0027489 I'm dealing with the inside really.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027489_0028055 So yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0028055_0029482 I found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV, presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that can be used for
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029482_0029852 wireless and you don't need to send very much information.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029852_0030249 Most of them are powered by some form of battery.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030249_0030387 Now, R1
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030387_0032173 I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by AAA batteries but those can be quite bulky so I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the controller. Can I interject to ask a question?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032173_0032222 Yes, sir.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032558_0032617 I'm ready
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032617_0033253 If you look at most remote controls, they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033253_0033769 They have to be obviously this size to fit those batteries in.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033769_0034754 Yeah, well you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the detrit across the
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0034754_0035461 which leads on to the next point about being small and easy to carry around.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0035461_0036032 Now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036119_0036880 Now the main components I came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries because otherwise it's not going to work.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036880_0037334 as I said about which batteries we were going to choose.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0037334_0039212 We can discuss that later. And then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal, which we're going to use to send the information to the controller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0039212_0040149 Now these have a wireless range of up to about 5 metres which is suitable for anyone who's watching their TV unless they're in a cinema.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040149_0040724 Which not most people do, so as a reply to the most audience that should be fine.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040724_0041786 And then I just had a quick look at the external design but I left that mostly to the interface designer.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0041918_0042276 And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what I wanted to do.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042276_0042828 It's not a proper circuit. I'm not sure if it will work or not.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042828_0043307 I'm not even confident that that is the real way you'd wire it up. But anyway...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0043307_0044180 We've just got the power going to the infrared bulb, the chip and the UI interface.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044335_0044440 which would basically
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044440_0045351 When you pressed anything, the chip would convert it into some form of IR data which could be decoded by the TV receiver.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045351_0045881 Which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045992_0047240 Whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using and since that's another reason to use infrared because that's what all TVs use at the moment.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047240_0047388 And then finally...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047388_0048772 We want it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost, so all the components that I've put forward are low in cost, so that should be good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0048772_0049534 It should be different enough from the alternative products to get good consumer base.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049534_0049953 we were talking about it before, and also just something that I was thinking about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049953_0051225 Because they're small, they're also easy to lose, so if we could look into some way of... I don't know, some anti-going-down-the-side-of-the-sofa thing that you could have.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051225_0051707 Dyna'r pwynt cyffredinol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051707_0051903 That's a very important point, it came up here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0052171_0052865 Alright, okay. And yeah, that's what I came up with there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0059548_0059679 function of a value.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0060745_0061098 많이 날 죽었었어.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0078292_0078370 謝謝您的
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0082660_0082831 Oh, okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0083072_0083098 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0084009_0084398 Świetnie.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0109929_0110099 Charles. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110365_0110586 A devoir être un peu plus fort.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110905_0111510 If you've got a Skybox, one of those SkyPlus boxes now...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0111510_0112232 You can record straight off the TV anyway, onto the TV hard drive or something.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0115583_0116633 Just as an idea on the speech recognition thing, it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0116764_0116844 there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0117659_0117763 more for speech recognition.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0118863_0120080 But on that again I just thought because you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is. So I thought that could be cool.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0130630_0131204 Well, yeah, you could have a number of different designs. I mean, inside, they'd be essentially exactly the same.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0131327_0131716 The features could be same and the body could look slightly different
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0134069_0134462 Yeah, computers.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0135290_0135625 Well no, because you wouldn't have to, you don't have to press it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138496_0138917 But also ergonomics, as we were saying, of the different designs.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138917_0140603 ergonomics, there's sort of physically different things, because if you've ever seen the Xbox, they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically too big.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0140693_0142376 they're cut just generally, Japanese people have smaller hands so they can get around the controller which is... so if you... I don't know what, because obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0150192_0151305 I was just thinking about how you could combat that because without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel it becomes difficult.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0151424_0151723 Yeah, that's for sure. Which is extremely expensive.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0154022_0154151 Just say people between age
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0162240_0162351 Video plus. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0163198_0163315 Yeah. Is that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0164781_0164911 in two days time and you're not sure
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165687_0165894 Anything like that is just number.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165894_0166237 And you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0166237_0166555 Yeah. Well, because you've already got the numbers for...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0167185_0167280 newspaper, TV,
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0169347_0169912 It's been around for a long time, it's just it's not very well advertised. No it's not, but I think it's
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0170330_0171457 If you've got something like Sky anyway, you can just click on it, you can just press the button on the program once and it'll record that program. When it's on, you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171608_0171863 So, that, yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171863_0172203 but just have that function would be really good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0177063_0179451 But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you sign for a contract so the companies who you deal with have actually, they've got an obligation to help you out and also, I mean it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I'm not sure how much the cost would be.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181345_0181412 Yeah, amazing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181639_0182014 I mean instruction books. Instruction manuals.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0182540_0182649 Very well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0184229_0184510 It's such simple functions, because you're focusing on that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0185403_0185487 It does.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0187956_0188561 And they're specially made for the mobile phones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0188561_0188987 But they come with a charger, I mean you could, you could bundle a charger. Well they light, they do light.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0190909_0191734 Yeah, and if you had one of those, just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the blooper in the room, that could...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0191928_0192056 Yeah, as well as.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0192552_0192970 Yes, some sort of docking station. Rechargeable with a docking station.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0193338_0193963 Yeah, yeah, that would be fine. And also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0053624_0053899 Maybe with that too.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059104_0059321 That's a pretty big cannon.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059321_0059379 I think like
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060255_0060416 Ммм... А ты не любишь?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060673_0060814 It's good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0061620_0062515 Some of my points might overlap with what William just mentioned. But basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0062515_0063547 this took up valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think will take a feedback from the marketing because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0063691_0064255 I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064255_0064919 So purpose as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make it as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064919_0065298 To summarize, I would say it should be user-friendly by being easy to use.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0065404_0066192 rather than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering driven, maybe having 100 buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066315_0066622 like volume control or changing the channel or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066741_0067462 But we are to make it unique so that people want to buy. We will punch in these two features together.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067462_0067737 So what the concept is to have a flip-top model.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067737_0069035 The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to say program their favorite channels or whatever.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069035_0069351 can be put in the middle part of the flip top
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069351_0070654 So it could be accessed by a wider range of audience. And we can punch in new features such as added features such as shock-proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0070826_0072814 findings most people prefer user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they have not used maybe 30 to 40 percent of the buttons so it's of no use of trying to put those things on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0072814_0073649 As we saw, we have to make a profit also. So we can maybe go for an economy of higher production. Like 50 million we said? Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0073649_0074378 Yeah, with that I think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also. So we can add more features and make it less costly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0074762_0075212 that's so this is if you ask me personally I would make a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0075447_0076762 flip top with a trendy design and maybe we should look at also like the buttons whether they are like soft or little hard because there are times the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0076762_0076903 Overall its simple
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077084_0077176 user-friendly design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077302_0077469 Any comments?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080345_0080468 to keep us here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080544_0080661 You can't.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080727_0080950 This can't be pulled
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081300_0081424 we are going to push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081928_0082028 I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0083436_0083550 等下東西就做得到啦
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0103476_0103651 Is that okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0112627_0113386 programming. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0114090_0114129 I can't breathe.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0130021_0130539 So are we talking of a single model or maybe 5-6 designs?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0131349_0131665 The features could be same and the body could look slightly different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0142436_0143060 Yeah, maybe to, as it was indicated, the risk for repetitive use.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143060_0143427 the injuries maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143672_0144196 so you are dividing designs based on not only segment H2, but also
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144196_0144633 you are dividing it according to the countries also, the market.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144633_0145286 maybe for US and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and in Japan and all you need to have a small one
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0153750_0153940 We could focus on your biggest market.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0154040_0154364 I would say people between the age of 20 to 35 are the biggest.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0183560_0184036 I think it would be too much of an effort for a person to, for a phone maybe he might walk down the street.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0184036_0184327 But for remote, we will just report it as a manual.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0192253_0192616 So are we talking about concept of rechargeable something?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198282_0198846 What I was thinking of a design which Nokia came up with almost 6 or 7 years back.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198846_0199279 Basically we have a flat one, it looks like a box, like a chocolate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199279_0199946 that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up. So they come up with something like this. Curved up. So here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199946_0200218 and you don't have to bend your thumb too much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200218_0200588 So it's like a banana shaped kind of thing curved up like a boat.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200744_0201169 so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201249_0201901 so it's already curved up so you can mold it to your hand anyway
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201997_0202359 the way you hold it, it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0202482_0202746 I want to say exactly the same as you, okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0206728_0206856 We will look at that later.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207096_0207273 What we were talking is to make it more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207410_0207989 You could put a logo in the corner of the model
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207989_0208367 rather than trying to make it like a seashell or what you are telling me
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0209025_0209098 Sí, claro.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0211055_0211171 Yeah, we could have done it twice.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215455_0215628 Yeah, maybe we could commit some set files.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215628_0216163 six designs and then choose whichever appeals the most. That could be the most common design.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0216283_0216461 We can think of 5-6 reasons.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0226542_0226773 for being lost.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0229030_0229156 and different from what I'm used to.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232357_0232411 Snap out of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232559_0232680 Okay, so that was two.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232928_0232967 Go home.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0000002_0000202 I'll wait until you're out, man. Don't text.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0005239_0005447 BANG
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008008_0008387 Welcome back everybody. Hope you had fun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008544_0009352 Right. This is our conceptual design meeting. I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0009477_0009969 from the last meeting.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0010104_0011160 This is where we talk about properties, materials, user interface and trend watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011269_0011501 So I think we've touched on a few things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011664_0011891 to that already but we'll just go over it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012298_0012602 The minutes from last time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012602_0013372 We had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0013372_0014280 it wasn't going to be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0014472_0016044 We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition. We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016044_0016539 We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, just a different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016897_0017210 You are going to look into the rechargeable batteries.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017331_0017939 and we're going to think about the port and alarm for getting it lost, things like that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017939_0018862 and our market was going to be young business kind of range.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0018862_0019193 Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0019193_0019284 Yes, if you feel.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0024946_0025060 Eski bir şey konuşma.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0035729_0035965 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036149_0036391 Let's start from the inside and work our way out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036755_0036949 Yeah, I don't think so.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0037104_0037309 Yes, thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0038856_0038972 I hate those little things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0039096_0039596 Especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0049745_0049886 be honest people want
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050012_0050260 This would be like wind up radio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050494_0050799 How long can you get out of that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050799_0051223 I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053146_0053294 when you go to the gym.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053378_0053790 Is that it? No. Is it? Oh right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053961_0054086 any
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0055701_0055969 I'm pretty sure the seller is from the Sun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056054_0056835 I don't think it counts electric lines now. But I mean, you don't want to limit your market
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056835_0057300 I mean people who live in basement flats, there's not that many people. But there are people.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058059_0058272 But then it would be charging through the day.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058272_0058872 I think the point is it charges through the day and then you've got it charged.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0059540_0059632 Yes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064002_0064729 But then if you think about and watch, it's on your wrist, so it's on your whole body, it's on your body the whole time. Yeah. So you're walking around.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064729_0065014 you're doing things it is moving a lot of time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065014_0065289 I mean you switch the TV on and put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065289_0065588 and you pick it out to change it and you put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065588_0065718 then again
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0068177_0068398 So it's not the draw on it is it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0069823_0069960 Don't you dig me
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071616_0071774 Expensive as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071774_0072311 What kind of price are you looking at for, I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0074029_0074161 The sun
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075002_0075156 Yeah, practice.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075916_0076308 They don't care because they just have a battery in their mouth.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080189_0080629 Okay, can we add in an attachment to clothing feature?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080799_0080978 Can we think about that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080978_0081433 Because if we're doing the kinetic thing...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0081629_0081912 We'll add it in to think about tonight.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082370_0082509 Where am I?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082509_0084553 If it is the kinetic thing, and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape, the kinetic is something people don't do, kind of, we're doing something original and different, but if you wore it, if it's something you could just clip on your pocket, then you would have that less
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084553_0084817 you wouldn't lose it so much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084951_0085271 But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0085412_0085659 the eternal battle for control of the cosmos.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0087163_0087235 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091816_0091988 What kind of things do we have to consider there?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091988_0092807 Can we, what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size? Well, and we would have to fit the, well the,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0111147_0111276 So they flip side? Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117621 So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0117621_0118084 Like those pens that you get with a grip. Yeah, right. That you can draw with.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0118872_0119263 Although it's been really popular with my boyfriend, so I don't see why not.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0129140_0129293 Oh, it was a fetal scientist? Yes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131235_0131449 I think it would be good to have a contrast between it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131449_0132237 If the whole thing is going to be this rubber thing, it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0132237_0132764 Now how would you distinguish, if you had a bear, how would you distinguish where you had to press?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0134328_0134463 I see you can handle Al, but...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0135045_0135233 easy to replace as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137437_0137923 Okay, we'll talk about that. So, if you finish here, we'll come back to that. Yeah, that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137923_0138131 That's the end.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144155_0144495 We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144866_0144989 Well, it's a remote control.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144989_0145772 you're sitting watching TV, are you going to want to open it and say, oh, I should actually go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the TV on?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0145952_0146152 Yeah, I've done to that I think.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0148283_0148597 I'm very proud of you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0155824_0155938 ग्राफिक लिया
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0160946_0161428 Can we swap that round so that the ones that we use are on the bottom part?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161564_0161743 because if you think about holding it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161877_0162283 you would be using your thumbs to press? Just like a mobile phone?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0163533_0164442 That's what I was just saying. And then have the LCD at the top and then be able to touch that for the other keytrans.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0164442_0165203 It has the volume and the program, things like that. On the lower side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0175745_0176007 I can't see that, it's like playing stuff and things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0176145_0176343 Is that volume and channel?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0179203_0179843 I'm not sure how long I've got left, but we need to make a decision about...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180107_0180200 the things we discussed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180270_0180650 So, we agree on...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180781_0180899 Do we agree on the battery?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181306_0181831 That means that there's no function for the port.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181831_0182425 you know, that it sits in the pressing button and having... so we could incorporate voice recognition into finding it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182425_0182687 It's a gadget, it's a...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182807_0182892 point.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0184800_0184921 I think the only
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185031_0185833 I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost. That means we have to cut down somewhere else.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185833_0186520 But I think pretty much we've used cheap, relatively cheap and simple things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0186520_0186655 as it is not true.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0187652_0187765 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0188079_0188197 That would be good.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0189165_0189312 Do you want like a backup?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191274_0191588 Okay, so I forgot the battery.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191588_0192062 The inside components are pretty standardised across the board, isn't it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192189_0192592 So there's not really a decision to be made there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192808_0193128 The buttons. What did you give us as a...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0193474_0193716 The bare board LCD. Yeah, the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0194471_0194948 On the top one, okay, you've got the touch. Yeah. Okay. And then...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0195625_0195847 Okay. Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0197336_0197415 No, it's fine.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0198156_0198256 for the inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0199200_0199392 I think so.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0200704_0201858 No, I think we don't want to be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway. The material that we would be using would be cheap.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0201858_0202008 So we could make it red.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202008_0202770 We could make it psychedelic. We could make it black and white zebra stripes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202770_0203384 but that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the, you know. Lithium. Yes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0203384_0203662 So you could just pick anything.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0205521_0206423 That's just different. It's just different from everything else. I mean, I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0206423_0207105 sort of beige and black. Do you either want something that goes with that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207105_0207294 which is what's on the market anyway.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207294_0208360 Or you want something that contrasts as, you know, like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock. Because they're so interesting.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0209428_0210011 and you would just have so many different options that you could do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0210011_0210708 You could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink, glittery ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0211630_0212456 And the ones that have rubbery spikes, you know, you could just go so far with it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0212456_0213177 like a puffer fish, you could take it wherever, so I think that's quite flexible.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0215226_0215710 Okay, I've got five minutes. Um... Oh, that might have been it for a while.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0222133_0222216 Have you?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0223557_0224476 Well they do but I think we can... Because it's the only one that's kind on the market. Well it is, it is. I think you just addressed that with advertising.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0224476_0225035 you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225035_0225419 Obviously it'll have the logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225419_0226057 The point is that it's got to send out somehow differently. But I think it does without that, so I'm not worried about that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0226877_0227640 depending on how... Yeah, depending on the expense of it. I mean, we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company is looking into, so...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0227763_0228698 that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive and we'd have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0228698_0229151 I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229151_0229325 Right, I'm going to wrap it up there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229632_0230258 I've got an end meeting now!
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0230519_0231255 So I think we've probably got... It says during closing we have 40 minutes. So I think we've probably got about that time before we come back.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231436_0231523 It's either that or...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231623_0232110 We only had 14 minutes to discuss what we just discussed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0232570_0232677 Is everyone happy?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0001757_0001913 I'm a little bit tired.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019124_0019210 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019333_0019451 Just connect up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0020110_0020144 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021791_0021898 Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021898_0022800 Okay, so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0022936_0023239 The methods we use to decide on a
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023460_0023678 current trends and so on, market trends.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023678_0024933 We did our usual market research study with our 100 subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most... I'm sorry, I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0024933_0025119 It's a trick question.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025119_0025656 We decided on the most important aspect required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025656_0025849 So that was one of the first things we did.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025849_0026370 Also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0026370_0026908 We also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion design in Paris and Milan.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0027029_0028144 The general findings from that was that in market trends, the most important aspects of remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028144_0028599 rather than the current function look and feel of remote controls.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028599_0028955 They also want a remote control to be technologically innovative.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029089_0029420 And of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029420_0029974 I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029974_0030639 is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0030783_0031218 So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third. It's still important.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031218_0031695 third in order of preference for the subject that we looked at.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031695_0032413 Okay, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0032413_0033086 Rydyn ni wedi cael gwybod o ein cynghorwyr yng Nghymru a Milan, sy'n cyfweliadu'r ffasiwn a'r dyluniadau,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033086_0033505 Fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033505_0033912 So she could be thinking of using something like that in her remote control design too.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034013_0034785 There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials, again in contrast to last year.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034785_0035432 So a lot of interesting feedback there, both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0035432_0035654 It'll be interesting to see what our design people make of that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036543_0036742 If anyone has any questions about that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036742_0036901 My auntie takes care of it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0039387_0039590 Hareketçi anamın tepesindeydim.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053232_0053491 He's got TV.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053491_0053571 No.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053916_0053999 I'm so sorry.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056191_0056303 and I drink wine.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056527_0056624 Not many.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0057116_0057532 But there are people.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0068504_0069132 Could I ask a question? Referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069132_0069148 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069148_0069726 Could people put standard batteries in? They could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging. But the two things are not compatible.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0071449_0071648 identical.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0076735_0076799 And the question is.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0079650_0080160 Yeah I think it would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0081231_0081853 Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in? Well, add it in to think about.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0085715_0086369 It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market researches. It's not something that people are looking for.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086484_0086645 I'm so open to the field, you know.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086804_0087020 Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115209_0115444 It doesn't matter what you do if you let it fall.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115444_0115944 I've got one built on myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily when I drop it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115944_0116500 I was just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that's silver.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0116500_0116979 that give the spongy feel. That also allows us to have different... And you can peel them off.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0117431_0117601 I'm pretty sweet and rapid.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0118463_0118836 Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128514_0128876 Also with the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128876_0129431 If we, for example, had a show. Yeah. Oh, it would be delighted. You could have a flat screen inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0129595_0129708 But I'm just wondering whether we should...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0132981_0133449 I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133449_0133915 Is it possible, just as an option, when we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133915_0134516 Or we have inside like a small pointer thing. Yeah you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0135041_0135232 that we had to replace as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0136802_0137175 Just a thought, they wouldn't actually need one in the case anything they've got couldn't they?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0137175_0137398 pencil or pen so I wouldn't really need it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141328_0141902 I just raised another point that occurs to me that kind of applies to both our designers here, if not she her, to the ten.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141902_0142008 If we flip open
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142008_0142721 Now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142721_0142795 Do you see those?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142893_0143138 and they kind of respond to the tone of your body.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0143138_0144102 Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell, it's a little compact mirror, and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display, or the remote control display?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144533_0144638 I just look at myself.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144773_0144835 Just a thought.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145341_0145424 我以前
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145424_0146099 So there's using the ideas from mobile phones and kind of got tapped onto that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0146202_0146611 Rwy'n ceisio feddwl am eraill o ddifrifoedd y gallwn ei adeiladu ac nid oedd yn costio llawer ond efallai y byddwn yn eu gwneud ar y ddŵr.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0148117_0148530 I didn't even forget about it. That was just a very quick answer.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0155760_0155881 I'm switching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162257_0162492 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162703_0162747 Выгони!
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162747_0162868 I like the idea.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162868_0163243 If we just use the shell as an example, you open that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0163243_0163660 You've got your LCD display there and you've got the buttons there, do you? That's what I was just saying.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0188370_0188958 We talked about kinetic charging, we seem to have decided on that. Did we decide on double or triple A batteries?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0189425_0190016 One of the decisions we had to make was whether we had AA or AAA batteries because they've still got to be charged this way, haven't they? No, the kinetic batteries.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190016_0190091 sequence code.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190507_0190607 Right, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190840_0191062 Got you on that one too.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0195977_0196170 So could you repeat that last part?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0196365_0196464 Welcome to the club.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0198820_0199377 So we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0199597_0200180 And it is just always rubberized and spongy. Apart from that, we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colors.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0200180_0200831 We're not going to try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203180_0203228 Let's see.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203764_0204429 Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that? Maybe about that size?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204429_0204917 Made of plastic, fits into the palm of the hand, rubberised cover that's spongy.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204917_0205635 Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel, which was the major thing that people wanted, Marguerite? That's just different.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208230_0208684 Rwy'n credu bod y cymorth yn y byddai'n dod allan gyda pheth arall ond dwi'n cyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i gyd-dod â'i g
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208684_0209080 We looked at Ocean Works, I mean, are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0209080_0209463 This would definitely be different enough. I just wanted to come up with something.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210551_0210871 Do you think the rubbery colours are going to be so relatively cheap to produce?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210871_0211662 If in a year's time you get feedback from the design phase, it's just something else that's coming. It's so easy to produce that and be flipped on.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0211662_0211788 Больше ничего не делай
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0215644_0216382 for a while. So can I just recap there, Sarah? Yeah. The decisions that we've made, kinetic charging, the watch type batteries,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216382_0216871 LCD display on the top side of the flip top.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216871_0217586 rubberised buttons on the bottom side. We're going to use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover. The case itself is plastic.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0217586_0217853 So far we've got Wales, we have to add to our decisions here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219094_0219334 So, are you looking at voice to speak?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219334_0219636 but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0221703_0221964 and incorporating the company logo
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0222656_0223061 I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223061_0223585 It's not just a case of having little R.O. on a fitness somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's R.O. product.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223838_0224119 You could say it's kind of a market. Well, it is.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226150_0226432 Did we, I know at the last meeting we spoke about a B-PREV.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226432_0226842 Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n ymddangos yn y ffordd rydw i'n ei ddweud, ond rydw i'n hoffi'r le. Rydyn ni'n ddweud hynny'n y ffordd rydw i'n ei ddweud, ond rydw i'n hoffi'r le.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0230669_0230756 It says you're close enough.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0009601_0009826 Yeah, I was getting into Christmas.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0036429_0036582 Yep, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0038097_0038352 Скулы.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0041188_0042252 This is all about the design of the edge components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042252_0042507 First, the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042623_0042742 into the method.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042742_0043948 The main idea of the whole thing is just so you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting it should be easy to find.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0043948_0044473 Also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0044473_0045055 because some of the things that we looked at last time unfortunately are not available.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045266_0045596 findings, I've got my nice little picture there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045596_0046596 This is the chip called the TA11835, which is what's used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0046596_0047486 based on your input and it's pretty much used for all TV remotes at the moment.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047486_0047853 And then we were looking into battery options.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047986_0048454 There's actually no rechargeable option available.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0048454_0049370 So I saw the standard AA and AAA which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0049370_0050219 Dynamo charging, I thought that might be a bit silly to be honest. It's basically like wind up radio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050219_0050626 So you've lined up your remote control before you use it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050626_0050702 كوني أهل
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051215_0051688 Yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it for very long.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051688_0052412 But I don't think it's really necessary when you think of the next two options.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0052412_0053316 like the the solar charging because most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got to use it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053691_0053742 Bizarre.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053742_0053910 Alright.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055103_0055725 Yeah, it would. The dynamo would take more space because you'd actually need a physical self-handler to wind up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055977_0056085 Yeah, I can't.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0057514_0058039 Yeah, most people also watch TV in the night.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0058725_0059062 So I think the next one is the best anyway.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059062_0059834 the kinetic charging which is like you get it in wrist watches and you don't even notice it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059834_0060386 I mean the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0060386_0060805 I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaping up to make it work.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0061351_0062662 Yeah, it charges into some form of, it's a smaller cell which it charges into and the size of a watch battery
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062662_0062874 because they use them quite frequently in watches.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062874_0064041 and that would last for, well I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0064990_0065140 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0065538_0066039 Yeah, but then again, I think it is because if you think about it, then what
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0066039_0067333 although it's only a tiny amount, it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out overnight when you leave them on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067333_0067624 and for the same reason.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067624_0068678 you're only using it for an incredibly short amount of time just to send a signal and then you're finished with it. So it's not the draw on it is it? No, no I don't think the draw on it would be...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0069582_0070774 the two things not compatible. Yeah I think you could have a dual power thing but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0070774_0071499 If you, like on a calculator, they're quite big and they all look identical.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0071725_0071915 that are very expensive.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0072299_0073132 Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest, I presume that then it would actually be the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073243_0073799 I think they're not very resistant to dropping.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073799_0074827 Because if you drop stuff, yeah, if you have the size you'd need to charge a remote it wouldn't be that big, but I mean, remotes always get thrown around and stuff.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0074990_0075189 I think, yeah, practically.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0075365_0076057 I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot, whereas remotes you do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0076239_0076697 Yeah they do, they've got dual things but the batteries are smaller I think.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077618_0077833 Yeah, so it is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077962_0078479 Yeah, if you had something using the standard...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078600_0078967 batteries and the solar charging.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078967_0079783 I don't think you'd... I think that it would... well you know how long the standard double A's would last in order to replace the... It would just detract from the attribute.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0079932_0080195 Yeah, I think it would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087220_0087329 我整個都在後面說
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087485_0088899 My second part of my findings, most current remotes use this silicon PCB board, which is a printed circuit board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0088899_0089550 which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0089550_0091768 it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to different legs on the chip and so sends a different message. And that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this LED in a sequence of on and off bursts.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0092714_0093013 Well, the thing about it is...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0093157_0094354 they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print a circuit board like that. It's simply spaced like that so you can fit the size of the nine buttons in.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094354_0094603 If you see how thin the tracks are.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094603_0095211 You could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0095211_0096216 if you wanted to. But there is an option to do it like that or you could have some sort
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096359_0096753 array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096908_0097666 and then to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode while not being used.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0097666_0098463 Now what I was thinking about that was, because sometimes when you have these things they've got little lights on behind the buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0098463_0099218 So you can see what all the buttons are. Like on a mobile phone you do it more often than on a TV remote.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099218_0099999 but you could have lights behind the buttons and after 5 or 10 seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099999_0100304 if we decided to go for buttons that could light up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0100491_0101417 The case material, I've been sent what the factory can actually give us.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0101417_0102327 There's the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway as the main case housing.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0102459_0103250 The main problems with the... well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0103250_0104324 titanium, very expensive, just the process to make it is expensive, and rubber,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0104324_0105188 Well you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year so perhaps something made of rubber.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105188_0105650 but I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105785_0106024 that they've put across.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106153_0106991 are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106991_0107867 I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0107867_0108482 The problem with the casing is that there's
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0108608_0109417 quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case design.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109417_0109818 If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109818_0110496 Whereas if you come to plastic, they can be a little more... they can do sort of curved shapes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0110496_0110920 but whether or not, because we'd have it in two separate units.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0111136_0111242 So the flip side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112321_0112383 Yeah, that's it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112823_0113240 Yeah, in titanium, I don't think it would be available at all really.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113240_0113765 the just it would well you could make it available in the titanium
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113765_0114170 It was just, it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0114170_0115100 because of the expense of how much titanium is. It's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a tank.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115243_0115311 Where am I?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115672_0115851 Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116388_0116511 rubber, yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116863_0117008 As you can peel them off, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0119373_0120482 Also, just going back to the interface designs with the buttons, we were planning to do some sort of touch screen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0120482_0121957 Now what I was saying before about instead of having, you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and say just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122071_0122465 over if you had them close enough. That would be one option.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122465_0122835 The second option they offer rubber buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122835_0123831 that I thought that an LCD type of screen, because one, they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0123831_0124958 Two, you can have them in a sort of array, you could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing, you could have them like a touch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125432_0125558 Uh, what?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125910_0127015 Oh, on the LCD screen, you could fit it. The problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curved things with it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127015_0127827 but you wouldn't have with the LCD you'd have the wires coming off. You wouldn't have that with the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127940_0128210 With the LCD you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0128504_0128659 Oh, so it's a...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129264_0129906 You could have a flat screen inside, yeah. But I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129906_0130571 It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white. But there'd be touch, touch buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0130571_0131188 So you wouldn't be pressing down on them. Or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0131618_0131678 Bro.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0132839_0133139 Yeah, I hadn't really thought that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134130_0134192 Y a un XX
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134192_0135048 You could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I think they could get a bit easily lost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0136768_0136855 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0137738_0138096 Yeah, that's the end.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0138991_0139069 Ah il est complètement...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139363_0139573 Yeah, yeah, that would be fairly simple.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139573_0140740 I mean you'd actually have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0140740_0141112 Because in the actual flip, you'd have some linking.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0146938_0147093 I mean you can't, you couldn't do it, you can't.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147093_0147921 you could have a... because if you just put the full charge through an LCD display it will completely blank it out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147921_0148233 But I don't know if you can get any mirror effect on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0156418_0156912 Yeah, if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this LCD screen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0163508_0163805 That's what I was just saying.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0174354_0174537 Well, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182295_0182473 Yeah, I think...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182707_0183573 Yeah, it is quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got these parts already in stock.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0183573_0184148 then it won't be cheap to remanufacture. Or it will be cheap, sorry, to remanufacture.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184148_0184662 So, do you reckon that's a good idea about where's the remote, I'm here thing?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184662_0184793 I think that would be called fun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0186500_0187432 The LCD is not cheap. Well, it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour, because if it just got a black and white one...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0187432_0187668 And they use them again characters
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189054_0189228 Ouais, il...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189926_0190502 No, the kinetic ones come with a battery that goes in a watch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0190615_0190857 So it's a lot smaller.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0193636_0194134 Yeah, I think we're going for the LCD on the buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0194134_0194770 On the top one. On the top one, okay, you've got the touch. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0195004_0195515 On the bottom we're going to have the rubber ones, the anti-RSR ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0196178_0197020 Okay, I've got the flip screen. The top one is going to be the LCD and the bottom one is going to be the rubberised button.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0198019_0198162 plastic
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0200605_0200649 I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0212137_0212251 It just goes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0214132_0215132 Yeah, yeah, with these rubber, these rubberized, not the actual plastic outside case, just the rubber.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0220154_0220323 Oh yeah, yeah, the whistle one.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0226986_0227165 Yeah, depending on the expense of it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0227609_0227779 I've got you slaps
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0229935_0229994 It is.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0008247_0008327 You know, I could have...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0036430_0036499 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054083_0054598 Regarding the sizes, which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration size also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054598_0055216 So maybe standard AAA might take less space and Dynamo might take more space? Yeah, it would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0060854_0061353 And what is the life of the kinetic battery? Does it run for a long time?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0064027_0064066 This is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0071528_0071765 Expensive as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0072058_0072205 We're seeing the normal background.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076724_0076992 And the question is like, sorry.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076992_0077461 Which one would last the longest? Because we don't want customers to be charging their mobile phones everyday.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0077596_0077934 or remote control like. So, you can just look at the light also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111124_0111763 So it's a flip side. And second question is like mobile you can change the cover. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111763_0112363 So in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the color like from green, barret green to chili red or something like that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0112363_0112923 Is that feature available in Titanium or it's only specific to Plasma?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117608_0117718 Yeah, I get it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117973_0118068 That could be a good idea.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0118192_0118395 It could be comfortable to hold on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125060_0125310 so i just rewired the last part
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125566_0125997 just what you said, I didn't get the meaning of it completely
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0134989_0135328 I believe I'll give the recap to you because I'm ready for the close video.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0135328_0136485 A person who switches channels very often or does reuse a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use it. And he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0136485_0136741 if you keep punching me then point towards the wall
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138042_0138503 I have never seen a small machine before like this regarding the circuit since we are having a flip top
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138503_0139147 We have customized the two circuits for different type of buttons. Like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the complex buttons on the other side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0139147_0139304 so we can divide the circuit like this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148592_0148738 Okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148998_0149237 I need to share something which I did here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149237_0149677 First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149677_0150290 especially for the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibilities.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150290_0150802 Second is we checked into competitors. The picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150802_0151570 So you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy, they are bored of black and white.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0151570_0152116 So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152292_0152729 and second thing is there is too much of confusion here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152729_0152905 No particular remote is standard.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153118_0153286 like some people have
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153441_0153591 Here you see this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153591_0153741 This is on iPad Pro.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153858_0154292 I found that the only common feature is the channel control and the volume control.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154292_0154798 Rest other buttons are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154928_0155214 and second as already discussed with William
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0155214_0156212 We are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the middle of the flip top and a graphic user interface, basically which is what we do in computer.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156212_0156505 have icons or touchpad over the... which is...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156891_0157538 like you have on icons or something you have is a good example of GUI, Graphic User Interface.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0157634_0157921 so basically a person need not point or click on a screen
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158012_0158431 press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158431_0159281 and on the top, repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing could be on the pointing device that means user button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159281_0159776 so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent sub-boot
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159878_0160312 So we are having a combination of boards. So on the simpler board,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0160312_0160780 On the top, we have these rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164344_0164499 the cake translucent to the glass.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164949_0165076 On the lower.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165076_0165165 O que você está fazendo?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165562_0165774 So the findings are too many cluttered buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165863_0166384 repetition of certain patterns which I already explained example the volume and channel control buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166384_0166613 All are confusing and inconsistent.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166613_0166912 Okay, we had a latest finding of voice recognition. There was a male voice.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167049_0167557 which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167557_0168273 We have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at low cost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0168273_0169125 But for like we had a response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169125_0169527 So it could be like, where is the remote? And the remote answers, I am here. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169527_0170446 some kind of thing or it gives a blep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170446_0170664 and technologically innovative also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170898_0171243 So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0171623_0172153 My personal preferences would be like, as already highlighted by marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172153_0172555 they want something to do with fruit. So I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172555_0173179 But yeah, we can take inspiration from fruit colors, like the vibrant colors, red chili.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0173301_0174236 tomato red or whatever and second thing is certain standard buttons we should have like for example if you see the previous slide
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0174609_0175151 I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0175151_0175720 So we will not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176016_0176429 This is the central one. Volume and channel.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176429_0177106 So keep that standardized because that's the most common feature across all models. If you look at all the models, it's here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0178082_0178157 Voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0181014_0181081 I've had it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0187746_0187925 Maybe we could start with black and white
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0188073_0188307 That would be good. Yeah. Upgrade later on up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197144_0197260 and further the same
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197709_0198266 For the body design I think plastic. Plastic? Yeah. For the inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0198266_0198782 for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0199172_0199264 just right there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0205544_0205727 It's different.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0212288_0212491 so far we did not take cupricion
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213084_0213742 and finally the body should be detachable, you can change the body of the case
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213742_0214102 It should be molded with the design in such a way that you can change it at any time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0214919_0214966 وعلى ترابط
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0218025_0218991 We are talking about voice recognition also because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate a remote control if it is lost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219083_0219306 So are you looking at a boyfriend?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219578_0219981 Or maybe like William was suggesting last thing, some devices you put on keychains
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220136_0220425 Oh yeah, the whistle one.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220425_0220813 So we can financially voice recognition is not feasible, we could go for a vessel voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0222260_0222540 so I am making it, but purely incorporating the design
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0230257_0230355 Again a question now.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0232171_0232396 I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0000368_0000686 If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0001995_0002074 사장님
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002393_0002526 and three apparently
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002738_0002856 Okey, az geçti.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003272_0003390 You're good to go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003390_0003552 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003664_0003952 minutes. We decided to use a kinetic charger.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004093_0004564 standard chip because it can come in various different sizes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004709_0004997 That can be a problem factor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004997_0005194 We wanted a standby function.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005194_0005672 The case interior is going to be soft, rubbery, changeable.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005672_0006122 Buttons with a combination of LCD and rubber according to the design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006122_0006812 Bright, funky designs inspired by free, keeping with the hip kind of feel.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006812_0007631 and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0007631_0008203 and the rubber buttons that we use will be anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0008858_0009029 Prototype presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0009260_0009381 I think that would be you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010325_0010586 Do you want to hold it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010901_0010995 Yes, yes you can.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010995_0011086 Okay, I get it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012537_0012988 She has one of those things and you can just take it off.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012988_0013135 Ah!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0014172_0014215 Oh, there's a guy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0020953_0021050 and the puns at the back.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0021493_0021601 Oh right, I didn't know that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0023326_0023877 So put it in the top section rather than the bottom section? Yeah. Because it's the top part. Yeah. Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027237_0027350 I'm so sorry
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027464_0027593 I like that if you tickle.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0032909_0032972 I hate you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033289_0033662 I think it would be interesting to see. Yeah, the front side.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033662_0033840 Oh right yeah okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033980_0034152 So when you actually got to open it...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0034235_0034335 Yeah, that makes sense.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0039904_0040303 But not interfering with the product.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041343_0041510 Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041653_0041912 Rapping and all that? Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041912_0042199 I've now got evaluation criteria.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0042707_0043170 I can't. I'm so sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0045226_0045415 It's quite similar to what it was before though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0058297_0058533 Just right smiling.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0060141_0060204 I'm dating him.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0063692_0063765 I would agree.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0064951_0065004 I'll see you too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0069602_0069659 A tear.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0072117_0072286 Just 2.5 for that one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0075853_0076076 I would say a 2.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0076076_0076158 and feel too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077244_0077443 1.7 billionth of our listeners.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077443_0077562 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0087136_0087889 Well the type of button that we're going to use in the bottom half, the material, minimizes our assignment to.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088191_0088855 Maybe because it's like with the size that we've got, it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088855_0089231 So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around to an
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089313_0089572 Okay, accurately, the button's in between.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089572_0089900 It's quite obvious, just big buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0095822_0095902 stand or stand
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096148_0096209 Everything.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096383_0096845 And if you didn't hear it in the room you were standing in and you realized it wasn't in that room, go into that room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102140_0102218 I don't think so.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102431_0102558 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102558_0102627 at a recital.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0103784_0104040 too much apart from having a huge big
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105024_0105081 Two things up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105433_0105566 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106383_0106722 Okay, I've got finance here now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106722_0107058 I'm going to flip this so you can all see it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111261_0111373 Now I presume
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111556_0111672 Let's scream a goodnight.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111791_0111963 that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0112668_0113201 We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113201_0113484 So, are we still on for kinetic?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113715_0113995 See, it would have been handy to have this at the beginning.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113995_0114217 It might have influenced our choice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0114509_0114789 Right, what's happening with the electronics?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0115794_0115886 Onlar ölüyor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117120 Oh, right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117520_0117628 So would there be two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117973_0118028 One chip.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119130_0119210 One double curve.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119730_0119868 So what's a single curse?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0120288_0120438 So just one travel.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0121644_0122034 We've got plastic and rubber, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0123290_0123329 You think?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0124483_0124648 It would be like saying we're using...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125074_0125261 See it says case material.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125385_0125843 So we're not actually using plastic in the case? No, no, that's it's a
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125843_0126008 It's in greeting.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0127840_0128124 Okay, we'll just put it in his hair.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128357_0128636 We should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128938_0129220 We don't stop at any other troops.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129220_0129394 Okay, special color, do we need that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129643_0129734 to improve.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138235_0138315 Those products suck!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138315_0138673 Oh no, it's 75. It's changed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0139863_0140057 It's not calculated yet.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140280_0140355 Okay, there we go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140434_0140639 ¡Que no hay...!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0141642_0141956 We haven't been dealing with dollars though, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142112_0142400 Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142723_0142945 If we add the interface
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146296_0146349 Rest in Peace
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146444_0146567 Where's the voice recognition?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146864_0146956 right okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147212_0147361 Well, a kinetic is three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147361_0147641 If we change it to batteries, that's minus three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148023_0148079 Alright.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148079_0148241 Keep singing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148868_0149309 We can do it some other way, it doesn't have to be voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0149309_0150037 We could do voice recognition for business class or something, like an upgraded version.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0150037_0150218 You could choose to have them or not.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0151326_0151659 So should we just change it to a high specification thing?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154493_0154605 Okay, we can...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154748_0155625 make the price fit and then say if we had our budget we would have had this because it also sets it apart. Because we've done all the background.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0155625_0156026 They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156026_0156347 It's something completely different associated with your company.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156347_0156467 Right, okay, so...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157505_0157721 Was it 12.5?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157721_0157907 No, it's 12.25.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158190_0158482 Yeah well 2, 12.25 times 2 is...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158669_0158815 25.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0160463_0160841 The gentle one was where the price was, wasn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162262_0162338 12.5
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162645_0162720 Now jump here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163089_0163418 So, is that got us covered for the electronics then?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163418_0163680 We don't need something else to take that place.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0165733_0165921 Right, so we've done that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166372_0166561 project evaluation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166692_0166948 We've done Room for Creativity, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166948_0167513 Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't, didn't feel able to make.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0167748_0167997 I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168536_0168736 in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168915_0169188 Um, did you feel like a teen?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0169188_0169806 Or did you feel like... I think you were nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173184_0173296 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173296_0173446 How did you find it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0176832_0177869 I like the fact that we could say an idea and it be suggested that it wasn't the best idea but no one felt like shot down.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0177869_0178399 You know, it didn't matter saying what you thought because if it wasn't something that was that relevant.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178399_0178669 And it didn't matter because it was just another idea in the field.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178669_0178828 I'm not that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179060_0179486 Well, you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179596_0180250 I think that was the best part of the film. I'm still not caught up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0180250_0180551 That's nothing to do with teamwork at all.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181444_0181597 That was quite fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181597_0182055 Means, whiteboard, digital pens, etc. What does that mean?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0182055_0182133 Und dann kann man die hier ausziehen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0183562_0183667 had time to kind of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184151_0184614 Yeah, because we could just sort of say, sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184614_0184842 I would like to email you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184842_0184984 but it was nice having it there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0185103_0185350 and like the whole picture of the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0189996_0190296 Yeah, I think it's the change from other areas.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191575_0191709 Yeah, no. Yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191709_0191888 Well, they have to come from somewhere. Absolutely.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192020_0192299 I do. I swear, sorry. Good. Sorry guys.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192299_0193197 As was shown by your presentation with all of the other remote controls, no one's thought about it particularly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193197_0193678 I mean they're slightly different, so if someone's been shut in a room and said, my car is a bit different from everyone else's.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193678_0194216 I guess that's something we should think about. But obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196176_0196984 But then when everything is really smart and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196984_0197713 I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0197713_0198494 I mean they could even go into, you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0198494_0199206 You'd pay a lot extra because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199206_0199556 but people could have anything that they wanted.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199712_0199792 present, and future.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0203973_0204308 Well, it's innovation for money's sake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204308_0204544 that people have to keep forcing it onto people.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204806_0205290 And you can't get, you've got your handset that works fine, but you can't get battery anymore for that type of phone.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205290_0205582 because the phones have moved on things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205778_0205904 It's madness.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206223_0206361 In closing...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206460_0206619 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206619_0207514 and our costs are below budget with recommendations that the budget be increased. But I think, I don't know, what do you think?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0207514_0207752 I think that takes into account
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208156_0208471 like us being well paid kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208471_0208983 and the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209312_0209994 So it looks like it's going to be 50% profit. You've still got all of the overheads to come out of that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209994_0210623 So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price they sold it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0210623_0210881 I think but you were saying that that's quite
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213317_0213646 Sushi never ever get me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213646_0213744 Maybe the island.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213744_0213984 Yeah, except for the other fella.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214271_0214736 The project has been evaluated well and truly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214736_0215214 And you've got the meeting summary in question.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215214_0215890 Alright, so we've got about 50 minutes to catch up to everything that I fell behind with.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215890_0216450 So I'll be delegating my role as project supervisor. So good luck.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0216954_0217203 I think the celebration is the 25 crownies.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0217288_0217464 Lara will be dancing on the dance floor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0218479_0218677 And yeah, just the last...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219181_0219500 I think I've got minutes for two of the meetings and then...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219619_0219703 last thing you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0222167_0222225 Chodź, dziecko.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0001511_0001599 Sen sana nasıl?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0026214_0026708 And then yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0041713_0041806 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0042882_0042934 BOOM
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0042934_0043055 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0045600_0046975 This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0046975_0047249 So this is the first stage of the evaluation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047249_0047547 The collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047547_0048158 was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048158_0048619 So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting. Are we actually meeting those trends and requirements?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048836_0049116 Now the findings that we came up with, just to recap, are here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049116_0049991 The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049991_0050845 It should incorporate current fashion trends and those, the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0050845_0051764 The design should minimise RSI and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0051764_0052317 Ond mae hynny'n deimlo ei fod yn stratega ffavoreig, ond roedd hefyd ar y rhan o'r ffyrdd o gael ffynonell bach.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052504_0052880 Okay, so we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052880_0053466 I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053466_0053913 We're going to use a 7-point scale, where 1 is true and 7 is false.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053913_0054337 We'll look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned and pull that slide back up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054337_0054894 and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054894_0054982 Does that seem clear?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054982_0055080 Are there any questions there?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055241_0055377 So we're going to look at these.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055519_0056226 Yes. We're going to come to, we'll discuss each one and we'll come to our consensus rating of 2, 1 and 7. Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056226_0056304 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056304_0056520 One is true, seven is false.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056932_0057098 So what would my son look like if I had a gun?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057098_0057436 We'll just do criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or A, B, C, D.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057436_0057767 to confuse it with an operation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057767_0058075 You'll see a day in your life.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0058075_0058416 This is where everyone's like, turn around, I'm gonna kill you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0059099_0059204 Oh, no.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0059577_0060022 Actually, it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating, we could take an average at the end.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0060022_0060152 Yeah, I see.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0060278_0060896 So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques and if we go 1, 2, 3, 4 we know who's who.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0061753_0062147 Criteria A. The fancy we can feel.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0062147_0062660 How do you feel about this prototype model?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0062660_0062886 One has achieved a sudden slow descent.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0062886_0063141 My own raising the lamp would be a tool.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0063252_0063448 One is true, seven is false.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0063880_0063962 Now I'm just...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0065410_0065609 before I'm gay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0065609_0066132 Adding those up, we've got 6 and 5, 11 divided by 4 is what?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0066132_0066551 And... 24 hours? No, 23.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0066551_0066618 저요?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0067192_0067463 2.75, there we go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0067463_0067945 Okay, criteria B, Criterion B, Technologically Innovative.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0068080_0068370 I would give that a 3.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0068895_0069292 Not that you want it. No, no, not at all.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0070532_0070718 Yeah, I just thought it was funny.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0070718_0070863 No.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071037_0071182 Is that what you're saying?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071496_0071665 Bis bald.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071665_0071800 It's a very slightly altered.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071959_0072177 Okay, I'm recording for you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0072303_0072420 Do you want to fight? Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0072755_0073010 J'ai risqué de le faire, mais c'est pas grave.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0073099_0073313 So are you voting for this one? Two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0073313_0073405 새롬
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0073581_0073734 So that is eight.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0073734_0073991 Two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074155_0074366 Okay. Ease of use.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074366_0074483 Easy to use.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074599_0074946 Based on what you said there, I would say one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0076023_0076113 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0076642_0077076 I should have said two to make the difference.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0077076_0077483 We'll just put almost two because one point says silly death by alesis. Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0077566_0077898 We hope we won't. So if we can bring it down, we can do this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0077898_0078492 And here we are looking at it incorporates current fashion trends.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0078492_0079300 And that's particularly in relation to our migrant research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0079543_0080152 So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0080152_0080387 Is this actually going to be the colours that you are going to use?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0081861_0082312 So it's fun sometimes, that's one thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0082405_0082585 I'm the one she feels like.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0083501_0083683 In that case, it's got to be a one for me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0084388_0084676 That part was nice, wasn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0084803_0085294 Moving on to, does the design minimise the feel of strain injury?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0085499_0085694 Aradığınız için teşekkürler.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0085694_0086008 We've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086156_0086309 Por qualquer fim, foi o que disse a ela.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086309_0086708 We talked about pointage but very use it without control if you're someone who's that thin.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086708_0087178 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0089981_0090294 I think I'm gonna have to do a new trick.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0090814_0090958 I'm gonna see you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0091194_0091503 뭐야?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0091763_0091965 傳奇 羅漢的傳奇
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0091965_0092202 So that's 4.75
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0092561_0092947 And finally, last but not least, is it a cage?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0092947_0093561 Yeah, it was
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0093733_0094033 Voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094033_0094237 I'll never have you as a ghost, or not.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094237_0094433 Yeah, yeah, that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094546_0094641 That's it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094641_0095029 I'd go for... we can adjust the volume on that just as we can for your TB.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0095216_0095536 There's something slipping out there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0096324_0096449 And if you didn't
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0097072_0097157 That's the one thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0097280_0097564 Bye.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0098073_0098582 So, how do you feel about this?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0098582_0099508 We've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications, that is definitely true for two of the six criteria here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0099508_0100102 That incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0100102_0101119 The lowest rating we've got, which is really, it's not terribly low, it's closer to neutral, is for minimization of repetitive strain injury.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0101119_0101757 Do we feel on the basis of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and produce this as a product of time and marketing?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0101757_0101958 We have to make a real application.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0102343_0102440 Yağmur.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0102690_0103123 I think the most important thing is that it's high enough that the upper end of the skin is to an extent.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0103123_0103201 I really don't.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0103308_0103946 on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities we can actually do much, much more.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104035_0104199 I'm in.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104279_0104500 Well, I hope that's, uh, clear to the-
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104500_0104817 Is there anything you would like to ask me about the findings before?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104928_0104965 I'm not.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0105269_0105357 I'm eating.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0105357_0105464 See ya.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0107225_0107291 Yes!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0119481_0119693 but it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0119693_0119769 So what's the point?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0119933_0120168 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0120168_0120283 I think it's...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0121063_0121404 The other curbs at the sides but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't go all over.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0124069_0124247 What does it mean if you put .5 here?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0125948_0126093 in Grede.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0126728_0127172 But it is going to be part of the total cost and there's nowhere else we can put that in, is there?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0127172_0127484 There's nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0127484_0127676 So do we not have to account for it in the course somewhere though?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0129433_0129934 Might do. I figure if it's something more exotic, aubergines and such like.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0137735_0138224 If you click off that square now, does that not make any difference?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138224_0138383 What's that one going up?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138626_0139126 It's uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing is not going to make a difference.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0139563_0139785 That's not me or Danny's friends, is it? No.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0140346_0140507 Go ahead and slide it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0141636_0141773 We haven't been dead.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142747_0142880 if we add the enter
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142988_0143645 If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0145029_0145509 People are used to me. If you take away the voice, I don't know what to say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0146166_0146338 Do we see what difference it makes?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151180_0151459 But we're still working to... So should we just change it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151568_0151710 In our recreation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151710_0152186 If we're looking to head off as specifications, this is what this project team is working for.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152186_0152756 We can put in our recommendations for what we've found and the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152756_0153037 But we need to work to that specification to start with.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153037_0153309 I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153309_0153981 But our object is so distinctive that that in itself is going to make it easier to locate, as in our first instance.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153981_0154491 Fel y dweudwch, gallwn gynhyrchu'r cyflwyniad llai i'r cyfnodau byd-drawethydd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0155506_0155799 because we've done all the background work.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0156540_0156796 So if we take voice recognition out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0157258_0157321 Very close.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0157989_0158071 응, 싫어
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0158071_0158261 Sorry, not meaning to doubt your work. Yeah, well, to...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0158747_0158964 Are they going to really quibble about NP?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0159145_0159456 I'm quite similar to one of you, though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0159456_0159566 Just listen to me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0161453_0161534 That's today.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0161940_0162069 I hate that. Me too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0162501_0162618 Rüya anladığımızı duydum.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0162791_0162873 So we're okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0169656_0170315 I think we had a really nice time. There was so much interaction, so much that we needed to find out and get to know each other.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0170315_0171238 I've certainly felt heard, listened to and that in relevant areas we've been able to give and take and adjust our remit whenever necessary.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0180677_0181283 Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys. Maybe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0181283_0181419 Your fate, Laura. See ya.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0182059_0182550 I think I just discussed which ones.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0182690_0182872 Could it have been better? Was it adequate?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0190085_0190483 It's evolving from other areas, it's bringing things from other areas in.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0190483_0190922 I mean nothing is new, it's applying it to a different area.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0191831_0191944 Absolutely, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0196007_0196202 video
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201108_0201817 I think it's really good that this has been very market research based because just going back to mobile phones
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201817_0202407 Dyma'r cymryd newydd mewn deunyddau cyfansoddiadol y gallaf ei ddweud, mae'n amlwg a'n gweld.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202407_0202851 We see it in mobile phones a lot and that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ideas from.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202851_0203137 There are innovations in that that people don't really want.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203137_0203687 I see people wanting a model of the phone they're really happy with and they can't get it anymore. It's innovation for innovation's sake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203687_0203961 and I think it's wonderful that our company is so R&D based.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204421_0204579 but forcing it onto people.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204579_0204892 things that you know they might want to buy the thing they want.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205457_0205662 That isn't a cover to fit it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205906_0205983 and
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0208960_0209296 I think it was just the production.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0210855_0211119 I think in the reading that we were given it was very specific.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211119_0211269 I think we've done what we're required to do.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211269_0211781 and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at those kind of things.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211781_0212244 I don't think that's something we have to look at to find a way of raising the cash for.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0212398_0213152 We've done very well to get within budget and still make such an innovative item that I think people are really going to want.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213477_0213648 Ewww.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213648_0213692 May I be the only one?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213692_0214036 I'm a DLM fella.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0219792_0219958 See you in two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0220084_0220492 Well I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221077_0221151 I'm right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221151_0221379 But do we not sometimes evaluate them in these meetings?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009137_0009262 It's that for us.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009949_0010093 Yeah, should I show?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010093_0010200 That's it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010200_0010830 Oh, do you wanna hold it? Do you wanna hold it? Yeah! I'll take the presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010830_0010982 Can I just make it? Yes, yes you can.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0011655_0011774 I'm a crazy man.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0012076_0012140 看電影
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0013863_0014453 Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, our final presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0014453_0015093 And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015277_0015894 It's going to have a plastic body with a sort of standard colour like this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015894_0016555 we're thinking something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0016555_0017582 This is underneath the rubberised outer casing, which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017582_0017838 but we can count on it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017838_0018731 the wide choice of colours and patterns so you've got a lot of customisation with it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0018731_0020259 It's obviously in a sort of clamshell design. The top LCD screen you can see there would be sort of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020371_0020670 The black and white touch screen?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020670_0021549 It would be inset into the top and the barns at the bottom would fully close flat.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021549_0021771 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021771_0022666 And working on the inside with, as already said, decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0022666_0023422 thinking about it now you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get some put it in the top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0023993_0024362 We decided that the voice recognition system
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024362_0024997 It did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a hold of.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024997_0025272 So we presume that they'd also be quite cheap.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025272_0025780 So you have something like where you chat at, where is the remote, and...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025911_0026127 It'll shout back, I'm here or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026345_0026723 And then yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026723_0026955 It won't shout out I'm here or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026955_0027532 It'll just turn on him. Okay. Or something similar. I'm under the surface. That'd be too good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0027532_0028157 Yeah, if it was getting there. Well, that could be something for next time. Maybe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028157_0028476 You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028476_0029174 There will be a standard transmission with the TV using all the standard chips that we've talked about.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029174_0029767 It would have, obviously because it's split over two different layers,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029767_0030462 it would need two separate PCBs that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0030462_0031657 And because obviously all TVs use this same infrared medium, we'd just be using the same thing to transmit the data.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031657_0031836 and the infrared
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031988_0032552 The sender would be on one of the bottom layers.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0032552_0032972 I just did the front of the... I don't think we have to put it on.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033080_0033210 Yeah, yeah, so...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033420_0033651 Yeah, I mean your front, your front side.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033990_0034391 So when you've actually got to open it, it'll be facing the TV. Yeah, that makes sense.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034391_0034801 And then finally, the interface.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034801_0035814 The top screen, as we said, would be an inset black and white LCD touchscreen, which would
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0035930_0037058 have all of the available functions for the remote on it, whereas the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0037058_0038061 like the volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off. And things to that effect.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0038061_0039089 And now we also decided on the inside we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezel
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0039240_0039783 Logo on it or something insert or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040004_0040229 No, not actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040229_0040867 No, not interfering with the whole look of the product when it's out on the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040867_0041709 And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics. Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0042881_0043105 I can't. I'm too young. I'm so sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0060100_0060169 Yeah, I saved it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0063870_0064567 Yeah, I'd probably put it... 2... Yeah, 2 or 3.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0064567_0064642 Night 3
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066278_0066375 I'm pretty
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066839_0066952 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0068639_0068737 I give it a 1.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0069005_0069175 네, 네.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080119_0080264 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080340_0081046 No, the base colour was white or a light blue.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0081046_0082045 But the changeable facies would allow you to get basically any one of the number of colours that you want.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082154_0082482 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082589_0083208 No, no, that's the spongy feel would be in the rub that you put around it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083208_0083491 but otherwise it's just a sort of hard plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083801_0083950 Yeah, I'm getting a little hot in this one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0087592_0087662 y me que más les guste
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0090559_0090965 Yeah, I'm going through five actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0093454_0093931 Yeah, it was voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0094276_0094535 Yeah, yeah, that's... Yeah, that's crazy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095126_0095345 I think...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095602_0096244 I think it would probably be a standard. It would be quite loud. It would be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0096244_0096449 And if you didn't
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097153_0097308 Yeah, bro.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097680_0098250 I do realise that a lot of people are fairly biased towards it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0102290_0102604 I think yeah I like it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0114834_0115187 There's regular Chetik on print and...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0115809_0115964 Han är en helt igen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116133_0116678 Yeah, it's... you've put in 3 for the number of kinetic cells, so it should just be 1.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116802_0117113 in the top it's the number. Oh right okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0117466_0117955 So would there be two? No, one would...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118064_0118366 Yeah, one of them and one sample sensor and sample speed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118818_0118949 Ne, da haben wir schon was.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119293_0119443 Teşekkürler.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119850_0120257 Yeah, I'd say it's just the flat bottom with one coat. Yeah, I think it's
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120464_0120574 One double curve.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120693_0121171 and what no because one yeah one's double curved and the other curves are the sides
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0121776_0121846 Price Guy
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0122318_0122413 Maybe a bit blank on that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0125714_0125931 No, no, that's... it's out of the next door.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0126045_0126679 So that shouldn't be actually on there because that's not incorporated in the custom remote.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0128633_0128764 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0130421_0130825 Yeah, the push buttons one and LCD display one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0131134_0131227 But...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0138203_0138312 Those planets suck.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139752_0139857 It's gone up again.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139938_0140207 You've got to click off
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0140518_0141065 It might... you might be assuming that that is in Euros.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141065_0141279 It's a kid being a daddys.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141279_0141927 Then we'd be fine because the exchange rate would be good. We haven't been dealing with dollars though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0143648_0144016 Yeah, the standard. We would make one difference.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144016_0144324 The biggest one would be taken away if you took away
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144543_0144579 Hayır, neylesin?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145099_0145444 If you take away the voice, I don't know what to say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145444_0145718 If you take away the voice recognition then you've got it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146347_0146418 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146418_0146869 Where's the voice recognition? It's SampleSense SampleSpeaker
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146869_0147206 Right, okay. Take away that, that'll make it 12.35.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0147540_0148015 That's minus three. Yeah, but minus three plus two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150154_0150760 But they... But I mean... In... I don't see why we have to sell it for 25 Euros now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150760_0151132 because they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0152684_0152856 meetings but we need to work to that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0153005_0153128 Yeah, I think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154713_0154772 Yeah, I think-
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154997_0155203 We had our kids.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0156794_0157060 Prends-en deux.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157060_0157389 Ja, wykluczyłem.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157389_0157688 Is it 12.50?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0163776_0164224 Because that was just a bolt on X-ray, you could just take that out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0164377_0164535 I'm definitely fine.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0165505_0165598 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0169504_0169624 I would say it's tape.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0170117_0170307 find out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173464_0173955 Yeah, no, I thought it went really well and I, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173955_0174893 I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0174893_0175366 Though we didn't quite make the voice recognition there, but that's good. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0175366_0176275 I think it would have made it into the final product if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0176275_0176799 I think maybe it would have come out a little different.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0179518_0179601 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182025_0182333 I think I've discussed which ones
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182963_0183503 Yeah, I think we probably would have used the actual email system more, had we actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0183706_0184183 had more time and if we'd been separated more.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0193972_0194451 No one's put any great deal of thought into it. I don't think the companies are really concerned.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194451_0194929 They're just like, we've got a DVD player, does anyone remember their own control?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194929_0195222 Can't you get the one that we used for the last one?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195222_0195447 Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195447_0195953 They don't really think about it because normally the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195953_0196277 They're trying to ship the DVD player, the video player, the DVD player.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0209117_0209327 I think that was just the physical.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0210588_0211064 Yeah, I was going to say that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0212327_0212444 Yeah, it worked out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213821_0213994 I'm gonna sell it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213994_0214279 What is this conspiracy going on here?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0214279_0214376 I'm gonna miss you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0216025_0216367 in my role as project supervisor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0218350_0218423 E sabe a gente.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0220460_0220881 Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your life?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221156_0221346 but do we not sometimes evaluate when these may come?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221346_0221542 Yeah, there it is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221542_0221919 I think yeah, question seven was the one I did just before the meeting.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002299_0002344 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002906_0002963 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0009468_0009897 Me and William worked on a prototype and I think William is going to make a presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010362_0010480 I can hold it like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010605_0010822 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0011596_0011657 Oops
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0012565_0012623 Ha ha.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0013210_0013453 Oh man, the hinges.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0015304_0015388 It's gonna have a...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0020479_0020798 black and white touchscreen yeah yeah it would be so insane
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0027429_0027532 I know, it would be too cold.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033228_0033450 I thought it could be a church.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033450_0033533 They affront you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033648_0034164 Oh right, yeah, okay. So when you've got to open here, it's the same when you've actually got to open it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0035666_0035739 This is from right here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0039896_0039971 but not into fear.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0040482_0040557 Look up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0042426_0042675 This is the last one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0044834_0045037 I think this is a good shit.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055079_0055182 I'm so tired.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055336_0055621 Is it everybody is going to evaluate or just the ones?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0060095_0060228 Yeah, I see you didn't notice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0065308_0065495 Eu vou ter fome.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066323_0066378 I'm just freaking out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066756_0066816 Take care.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0069892_0070123 What does it say? Anybody talk?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070123_0070298 The first one reading I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070298_0070429 Can you just make it two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070543_0070603 That's the best.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070603_0070757 Yeah, I just thought it that way.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070898_0070995 N.A.N.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0071117_0071242 Yep, I just got it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072069_0072130 뭐래
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072878_0073085 Ama iyisi gözüküyor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080695_0080800 Wine pool!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080800_0080861 All of you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0082600_0082771 Nie, nie, nie, to jest...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0083007_0083114 In the rough
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0093601_0093754 Войс, прикольный.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0107878_0108004 You want me to unplug that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0109655_0109698 Don't tell me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0115001_0115080 Take my breath.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119093_0119208 Sing one level higher.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119371_0119432 Just because.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120299_0120367 To jest łatwe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120773_0120865 because one another.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122178_0122445 That's Ticu 1 and maybe a special encounter.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122756_0123099 I think rubber since it's being used just as a casing we can put 0.5
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123349_0123443 Yeah, cause it'll...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123549_0123800 I think it allows it from something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123800_0123894 you can use that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124252_0124459 means we are not using lot of rubber actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124459_0124535 It would be like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124679_0124956 a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0130211_0130272 Push button.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137174_0137358 You could change the battery also
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137358_0137594 instead of going for kinetic, how about going for a standard factor?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139161_0139263 and go fly
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139789_0139960 It's gone up again.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141567_0141760 We haven't been dead yet.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141989_0142114 I think it's in your room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0143373_0143511 I'm going to a video about it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144422_0144689 But I feel these customers never said anything about the battery and all that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144689_0144939 It's internal, nobody looks into the battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144939_0145209 but shape and curve, that's the only way to show it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0145866_0146022 where is that special form?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0146133_0146305 Shall we see what difference it makes?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0151558_0151753 We're putting our recreation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157223_0157350 Ja mówię kluczowy wojtek.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157501_0157589 Go fuck.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0158800_0158933 to really quibble about it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160150_0160473 I don't know but it's 50% is the cost
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160473_0160647 I'm not gonna change everyone's words.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0161295_0161388 I think that is the first one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0162472_0162610 Kır yağını.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165317_0165375 Seems fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165580_0165807 I'm surprised she didn't mention everything else
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0169703_0169821 I think it's quite nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171331_0171714 I think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171714_0172027 It's not like people trying to cut each other.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172027_0172218 it is more of a cohesive teamwork
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172218_0172557 We came to a very pretty creative design
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172672_0172761 يا أهل النار
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172892_0172964 Yeah, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172964_0173137 and Sara you coordinated the work very well
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0179596_0179920 I think that was the best part of the book.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185416_0185717 Yeah, I'm pretty much moving around the room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185717_0186263 I think it's good, like we spend time individually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0189474_0189743 anyone thought of remote control with a flip top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191020_0191204 Ha ha ha ha ha! That's mine!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191664_0191739 Yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192004_0192079 Prepare to hatch.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192175_0192251 and sideburns.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0199681_0200613 Surprising thing is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every month you see a new launch or something like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0200613_0201118 and new television products coming up but nobody giving much idea to this
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0201118_0201302 I think it should be good that this has been
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0210559_0210707 Maybe people are thinking
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0213665_0213719 YAHTLFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJHFJ
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0215140_0215234 Das ist aber ein Tröpfchen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0216751_0216948 Celebration, you didn't talk about that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005586_0005769 Okay, everybody ready?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005769_0006085 I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006200_0006547 and with name and what your function is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006547_0006729 so maybe we start with blue
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0008798_0008859 And your name is?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010788_0010851 매이크업 끝
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010851_0011071 And as you already know, I'm Betsy.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011071_0011307 I'm the project manager for today.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011307_0011817 So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012134_0012611 Opening acquaintance tool training valve
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012611_0013238 The tools, I think we already, I guess the tool is really the computer, as far as I can see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013287_0013804 Each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013804_0014097 project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014097_0014616 I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014944_0015168 here is what this thing should be
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015168_0015754 The thing we are going to design is a new remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015754_0016232 should be original, trendy and of course user-friendly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0016519_0016699 So maybe you can make some notes of that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019638_0019744 Alright.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019744_0020164 Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0020378_0021157 That is, it's going to be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021157_0021820 The same goes for the conceptual design. There will be individual work and then discussion afterwards.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021944_0022212 detailed design. Same thing with...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0024394_0024545 I can't drive Mrs. Sutter.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025468_0025736 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025736_0025774 Alright.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026002_0026470 Then tool training, try out the whiteboard, person can draw their favorite animal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026470_0026872 Does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026872_0027252 so that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027468_0027612 You want to go high lean and...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027758_0027986 without hanging yourself
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0028810_0029082 And remember you have to press so it works.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0030752_0031064 Oh, I got that fact.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032052_0032258 and you're front team, right?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032258_0032750 Would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033022_0033083 Co to?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033083_0033153 No, that's okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033357_0033549 I didn't get to that race.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0036725_0037272 is a project finance, which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037272_0037593 Selling price is supposed to be 25 euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037725_0038609 Profit aim for the company is 50 million euro. The market range unlimited, meaning international
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0038740_0039364 and production costs should not exceed, hopefully should be less than 1250 Euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0040381_0041267 So these are all things of course to remember with the budget and when you design to materials, cost, etc.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0041916_0042758 Now the discussion I guess is, does any one of you have experience with remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0042895_0043324 We use them, right, every day.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043324_0043499 and um
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043656_0044399 Now, having used the remote control for years, does anybody already have like an idea, like things you didn't like with it?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0044399_0044923 things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing, any first ideas?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0045037_0046058 Do you like it to be smaller, bigger, have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons, you know, things like that?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0046515_0046621 small right?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0048672_0049526 So it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines, basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051311_0051812 It should be something new. It should do something different than just what we have.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051812_0052107 Now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052422_0052829 Like trendy, you know, like earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052829_0053345 Maybe different colors or materials.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0053345_0053873 So yeah, shapes, right? You know, like kidney-shaped fills better in your hand or something, you know?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055123_0055827 That is true. They put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or you know whatever.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055827_0056564 And suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the TV off and say, where the hell is my remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0056614_0057317 Or if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a sound or a signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057471_0057593 Be flustered.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057674_0058145 if lost, signal with me, throw signal, you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058567_0058790 Exactly, I mean just that's why I say
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058790_0059260 I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beam or light
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060567_0060957 Okay, my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060957_0061646 in other words if it's like in a dark spot, meaning you know like a newspaper is on top
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0061646_0062032 sweater is on top or it's behind a plant.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062032_0062575 At that moment, it's like, what do you call it, the light sensors, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062575_0063003 In that moment it has a center, it gets a certain darkness.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063003_0063476 it has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063476_0063721 I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064129_0064224 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064224_0065078 you know, it would be, right, you have to have some kind of sensor. And I think voice or clapping, that's not specific enough.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0065078_0065848 I know there are the lamps and stuff, you can clap on and off, but I think they only work to a certain degree.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066408_0066480 what goes with it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066770_0067159 Oh yeah, well, but then we can't help everybody.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0067808_0068395 We have to move along. Yeah, we have to move along, but I think we have some good points to start with here.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068584_0068849 Ok, the next painting will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068849_0069212 I think you'll... Did you get notices on your computer for this?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069212_0069545 Okay, so you've got the notice.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069545_0070163 The working design, I guess that's the function ID, which is this one.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070163_0070398 industrial designer. That's you.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070746_0071113 So we're looking for working design when you come back.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0071572_0072011 and then you are the technical function, so you are the working design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072011_0072439 So you have the working design and then a functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072439_0073430 And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness and what we just discussed in general.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073430_0073594 That would be your idea.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073594_0073824 And of course, price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073824_0074169 That's it. That's it. That the price is a good price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074169_0074465 I mean the price is given but that with...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074633_0074679 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074944_0075008 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075138_0075610 and you will get specific instructions for that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075610_0075784 I think that's the end of the show.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0076472_0077087 So we have, well, we have time, two, three minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077087_0077357 Any questions at this point?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077357_0077595 or suggestions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077780_0078716 I think basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions, I guess you can...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0079796_0080194 Then we see you in about 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0080194_0080361 and see what we can come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009185_0009269 I'm Janabee.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009269_0010740 I am an industrial designer and my responsibilities are to deal with technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0042869_0043119 I just...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0048170_0048273 temperature inside
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0049278_0049524 Machines basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0051779_0051874 Now of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0052783_0053265 different colors, material shapes, or even colors.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0053809_0053924 thing you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0057201_0057472 or a signal or something.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058148_0058588 Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can just recognize where it is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058588_0058634 Exactly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058700_0058795 That's what I'm saying
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0059086_0059303 people are polite
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0063430_0063763 I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066398_0066528 What?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066611_0066715 because you're silly because
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0068207_0068311 Good points to start with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0069165_0069233 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0070461_0070773 Yeah, it's functioning. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071171_0071568 Working design, yeah. It's maybe technical functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071725_0071875 technical functions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079125_0079260 About two people.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079260_0079395 Yeah, I think.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079652_0079781 Alright, well, we'll see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006739_0006909 My name is Franzina.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006909_0007661 and I'm a user interface, my role is the main responsibility is user interface
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0007661_0008083 And my role is to design a television remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032223_0032416 Yes, I'm dancing it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032416_0032508 and answer.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033158_0033336 No?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033747_0033963 Should I?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0034799_0034978 I'm going to go to sleep.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0035586_0035895 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0045394_0045442 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046146_0046571 Yes, I feel that all the remote should be very compact and small.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046571_0046979 Those which we get here nowadays, it's very long.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046979_0047276 and it should have multi-purpose.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047276_0047914 like the remote control which we use for TV it should be used for some other purpose also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047914_0048673 like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating system.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0048848_0048946 Yes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052105_0052326 Yeah, design should be, yeah, it should be different.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052326_0052544 almost all the trainees
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052790_0052882 Yes, maybe I should-
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0053067_0053246 the sheep also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057312_0057325 you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057704_0057778 Just
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057858_0058016 signal basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0063866_0063918 I need a swig.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0066540_0066638 because
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0005725_0005770 I think so.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0006154_0006257 That's a good end.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008339_0008533 and I'm a marketing person.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008533_0008694 I want to figure out how to sell them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008882_0008969 My name is Aileen.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022046_0022155 I'm saying things.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022276_0022645 We have different types of design that we're going to be concerned with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0023611_0023838 Conception.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024101_0024250 I'm not.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024812_0025104 Maybe we should redesign?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0025279_0025469 After we finish the remote control, we'll get to that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027623_0027852 Okay, I'll see what I can do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027852_0027889 We did.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0028008_0028551 See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029006_0029219 So I'm still in pain.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029219_0029775 Um... um... um... traditional... yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0030798_0031573 I'm very soft.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0031573_0031812 And it likes to sit like that. Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0032877_0033282 Am I supposed to wipe off? No, no, no, that's okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035732_0035806 Ow!
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035999_0036482 The kitty cat is hungry so it'll like sneeze.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0039523_0039851 Okay, that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0040286_0040648 So these are all things of course...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0049614_0050276 I had 12 50 euros per hour.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050378_0050675 Who knows, if we get a really good signer, maybe we can do that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050780_0051357 We certainly can try to. I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0051736_0051776 That's hot!
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0053853_0054232 Yeah, friendly shape. Yeah. That would help.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0054232_0055025 I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap. Because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0055025_0055113 They can't find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0056602_0056712 Well, or yeah, or you-
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0057264_0057676 email or something. So if lost...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0058039_0058091 signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0059225_0060571 I think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond... What should you have to do to make it beep or blink?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0062554_0062623 Okay, and that...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0063909_0064125 And so the light sensor would activate the signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0065819_0066177 It could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066522_0066689 Well, because you're silly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066689_0066793 because people are so-
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066866_0067777 And those can be... we can't help everybody. If it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0067777_0067999 You know, maybe we have to move along.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0074525_0074986 We have to justify that by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0078758_0079163 I think I will have to think about our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079163_0079283 About two people. Yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079650_0079774 Alright, well, we'll see you in the rest.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0080380_0080453 Okay, please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0003732_0003865 Okay, celebrate. Are you ready?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0004717_0005869 I take it you all have received instructions as to what we were supposed to do? Yes. And
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0006079_0006733 I think the marketing manager probably should come first, addressing the needs and desires.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0007843_0007903 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0009559_0009705 participant
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010096_0010373 Okay, kill him, face him.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010629_0010753 Uh oh.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034130_0034686 one other appliance or maybe a lamp. Can I at this point interject something?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034686_0035355 We have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0035355_0036262 The one thing, for example, something to eliminate, maybe, that's the teletext, because that's sort of outdated. Okay, the internet.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0036262_0037062 And according to higher management it should only control the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0037062_0038107 Mostly because they feel that it's too complex a task to include other things and they're concerned with the time to market.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0038285_0039112 And the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039112_0039508 and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039508_0040221 so that it's easy, that they can be easily identified as a product of the company.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040221_0040704 and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is paying this ad.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040704_0041353 So I just wanted to check this here so we're not getting too much off track here with the things we want to look at.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041353_0041995 These were instructions from higher-ups, so we have to eliminate these things. So it's only going to be TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041995_0042510 But the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0042638_0042729 All right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056303_0056460 and uh
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056599_0057157 Who would be next? I guess that would be you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0057229_0057449 You want me to get your signature?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058082_0058319 And you are number three. Number two.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058319_0058366 Now what?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060454_0060526 Yeah, I have to go.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060798_0060871 Zack!
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0071692_0072250 That's already been eliminated by management. So off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0083585_0084194 I think it's possible. Yeah, well, I've already written it. So that's a pushing you to a point now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0085700_0085744 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086748 It just build up to be basically young. Yeah, yeah. It's just...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086928_0087468 It's what you'll be looking at if you build one wall that's going to make a big difference whether it's going to be square or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088357_0088405 Oh yes!
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088531_0089146 I think we'll have to look at the budget on that, but I think in principle that would be kind of fun.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089146_0089183 Because we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089549_0089661 Silly fool.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089733_0089875 I can't help but shed a tear.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096671_0096935 a little elderly, a little arthritic hair, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096935_0097875 and it's a small button and they don't press it exactly you know something else happens not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0100099_0100191 I'll get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102284_0102486 Because the clock could be really fast.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102808_0103154 You know you're seeing this in Korea, Korea, no other.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0108556_0108634 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0111613_0111738 shoulder.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0115161_0115274 Oh, you don't have to.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0117944_0117979 This one?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0119741_0119918 And... one more time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120040_0120160 You are. Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120306_0120341 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0121071_0121245 What you wanted, full of pain.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0127901_0128111 on the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0128111_0128168 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0130485_0130598 fire up suddenly
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0149375_0149515 Timer, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0150288_0150602 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0153384_0154275 On my slideshow, basically we have already done the agenda and on the closing, basically there will be a lunch break and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0154275_0155070 However, the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155070_0155734 and what function, working design, how does it work.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155734_0156064 So these are the two things we should come up with.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0156064_0156654 So the first thing is maybe a little easier on who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157093_0157263 I guess in many ways everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157448_0157621 everybody who has a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157798_0158314 Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158314_0158496 There are a few but in general not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158673_0159520 Now, talking about the target group, which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0159520_0160519 We have earlier, it was mentioned about, for example, elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160519_0160975 So I think that's one group that's certainly important.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160975_0161845 Then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0161845_0162455 and I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0162455_0163223 I mean, that's a question, whether that's important that children can really use it or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163447_0163714 So these are just some thoughts I have on it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163714_0165367 And I don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're going to design this one thing. Or whether we're looking at what we like, we're talking about different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0165367_0166225 Whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0167876_0168847 a lot of marketing pull. That had a lot of appeal but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups of people.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0168847_0169322 I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0169322_0170178 You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent banana color or whatever. You know. You make a banana shape one. Yeah. For example, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170178_0170467 But the question is really, who is our target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170623_0170867 Do we look at one target crew?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170984_0172090 And with the 25 euros, you know, can we afford to have, I'm asking the technical people here, whether to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0172297_0172966 sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group, how much would that throw us
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0173074_0173490 out of the cost we are supposed to respect.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0175538_0175628 We'll have to see.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0176298_0176399 well that's the family
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0179785_0180380 The question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0180380_0181272 And I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons, you know, within the target group or subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0181272_0182218 The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182218_0182431 I mean the basic design I understand will be the same.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182431_0183428 But the question is, how much will that set us back if, let's say, 40% we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons, for example?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0183533_0184353 So that remains to be seen, but the charge group as a whole is basically everybody with a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0185553_0185747 Yeah, well that's the question.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0186847_0187426 Well, maybe there's an idea, you know, for example, new portable phones.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187426_0187816 they have like removable plastic cases.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187816_0188477 So you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0188477_0190040 that in each package you have, for example, you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it, but then you have another color or stripe or whatever that already comes in a package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190040_0190371 And then if people really want more colors, they can buy it separately.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190507_0190650 mobile phones
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190927_0190982 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190982_0191694 But if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0191694_0192696 and they can go to the store for a few francs or euros, whatever, they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it, you know, for example, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0194549_0196111 Well, I think the idea here is to design one remote and the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics, if you want to put it that way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0196111_0197066 Having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people, either for children,
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197287_0197556 I've been a cyclist, I guess that's the old message.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197828_0197944 Viel Spätsommer!
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197944_0198241 Um... Yeah...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0198892_0199452 but I think we do some more research I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0199452_0200023 If money permits, we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200145_0200247 I think it's really sad.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200474_0201028 Do we agree on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201207_0201447 So now I understand it's lunch break.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201548_0201631 and um
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201778_0201922 So that's what we will do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202220_0202324 So thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202439_0202690 and we'll see you after lunch.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0011039_0011117 I'm calling for aid.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0026483_0026554 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0037439_0037582 to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057119_0057188 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057335_0057454 Yeah, sure, I'm sure.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057454_0057498 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0058247_0058379 Number two.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059092_0059158 I'm sorry.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059376_0059594 Can you move it off the screen please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059841_0060125 Na, mae'n dweud y gallwch chi ddweud.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060245_0060521 Przybijaję wędrówkę.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060521_0060592 Tote, tote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060771_0060994 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060994_0061373 Today I am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061373_0061644 Can I go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061832_0062592 The method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0062592_0063941 It takes the power from a battery, say battery, it can't be an electric supply like you have to like switch, connect your remote controller to a power supply from the electricity or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0063941_0066293 it should be a battery because remote control should be like you should take it to wherever you want and then this integrated circuit takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into infrared bits and it sends it to the device
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066293_0066601 like a TV or air conditioner something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066643_0067027 A remote controller is specifically designed to a single device.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0067027_0068629 If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency. Like the remote controller it sends some bits, some waves like with a particular frequency. The device should know what the frequency is.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0068629_0070147 it should recognize the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote controller will send a signal
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070147_0070757 and the TV it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070757_0071600 change the volume control. So I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0071851_0071905 management.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0072628_0073653 So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user interface like a switch pad or something like that. Buttons should be there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073653_0073867 so you can control whatever you want
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073867_0076040 you want to change the channel, you want to control the volume, you want to mute the TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations, there should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and TV can perform the actions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076111_0076315 So can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076382_0077721 I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller. I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much of the investment also.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0077721_0079412 It's like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller. Those we can make like fluorescent. They'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0079506_0081211 and there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed. If suppose a child is playing with the remote control and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that this is not a action.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081211_0081515 there can be no action taken to that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081515_0081690 and there should be a child lock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081690_0083182 like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like if you have kids and all then they will be playing with remote controller so you can lock the remote controller
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0083182_0084080 Make it usable for more than one device. It's hard but it's possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084080_0084245 Yeah, you'd point me out.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084245_0085364 and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and so that's good for
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0085488_0085806 fun fun shade and colors also
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086009_0086577 No, I don't think it will be. You can have it if you want. It just builds up to the base.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086627_0086683 Yeah, I hear it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086683_0086926 It's just as cheap so it doesn't matter.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088300_0088570 Yeah, that is also possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088713_0088792 Yeah, that's about it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089120_0089205 Because we had to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089635_0089884 I can't believe for children, I can't believe I don't make shit.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089884_0090028 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090210_0090371 I'm just kidding.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090440_0091106 And the buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091106_0091392 if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091392_0091748 If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091748_0092561 so I think we need to make some buttons which are intended for two or three operations
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0092561_0093299 Like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel. If you press the other button in another mode it will change the color.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0093299_0093901 So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0094196_0094311 Uau!
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0095879_0096045 something.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0096256_0096337 time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0097647_0097780 and everything else and the favorites.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0098176_0098450 You don't feel the mood change.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099002_0099208 Yeah, shapes also different.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099208_0099290 triangle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100079_0100646 But we'll get to that with you. And also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguities. That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100706_0100788 That's a good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100893_0102201 and display clock if you want more features then we can display a clock I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102313_0102440 because the clock could be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102753_0103119 You're using a radio, because you have no other answer.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0103811_0104056 Can you go to the next frame, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104056_0104880 The main components we need are buttons and underneath that there should be switch.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104880_0105030 and bulbs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105030_0105851 We can have a bulb whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on, suppose.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105851_0106265 then the remote controller should automatically have a light on.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106384_0106796 then it will be like if you switch on your TV through another source.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106796_0107456 not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107456_0107578 Maybe we can have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107578_0107880 Whenever the TV is on, remote controller will have a light.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108020_0108277 and then in florent bulbs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108277_0108576 this is like when it is dark
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108668_0109143 and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109143_0109521 which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109521_0110074 and wires connecting all chips, switches, lights everything so there should be wires
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110167_0110652 and of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110652_0111183 you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to give a shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0111509_0111579 Hold up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112017_0112192 Jag har ingen ljusklapp.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112286_0112464 Next is little crease
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112611_0113850 I have referred the site, the homepage of our website from where I got few points.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0114021_0114147 That's it. That's it from me now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115275_0115370 It's not like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115370_0116172 I have referred the page to get new ideas of what can be the working design to how it works in all cases.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116450_0116514 if you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116568_0116646 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0117636_0117926 It's actually there on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137491_0137642 Yen or Tishya?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137642_0137890 if there is a clock then that can be a alarm clock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0149124_0149678 later and use it. Okay it's like a timer. Timer yeah. It's like a lock. Yeah and then you can use it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0157482_0157685 who has a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0158170_0158348 don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0175767_0176417 we can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0176666_0176809 and middle aged but younger
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177578_0177728 Yeah, of course that we can do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177728_0179020 but specifically if elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a remote controller for elderly and for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179020_0179123 What about the electronics?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179295_0179446 It doesn't cost.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179728_0179872 doesn't matter.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186614_0186661 person
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186661_0186947 industrial. I don't think no. Well maybe they still
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186947_0187015 There's an SP
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0190462_0191133 Mobile phones have different covers
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0194588_0194668 I think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198668_0198931 Maybe to our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198931_0199144 I think we need to do some more research.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200029_0200753 70% is a unique... Do we agree on that in principle?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200825_0200991 We will be able to do that on our own.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0202280_0202326 much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0026925_0026998 Somebody take a look
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0027570_0027685 Sejam...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0071586_0071643 나한테 불러
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0085727_0085777 I'm just saying.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0086714_0086806 You know, just as
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0089813_0089969 I said don't ruin it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0097699_0097754 if they ever
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0102334_0102375 it just
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111068_0111184 C'est qui, Vimote?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111410_0111519 a case holder.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111519_0111649 Holder, remote hold
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0119903_0119972 to spend too.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0120208_0120273 Nodal M3
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121036_0121146 What do you want?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121146_0121371 Full screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121442_0122422 As a user interface designer, I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122422_0122697 Can you please go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122697_0123822 So I found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance, at remote distance.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0123988_0124081 Now for that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0124081_0125332 A remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the TV and it can control the functionalities different functionalities of the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0125332_0126793 There should be a signal, something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television. If the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume, he can change it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0126978_0127965 Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user choice.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128388_0128951 So if we want to view a particular program, let's say 9 o'clock, he can set the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128951_0129389 and the TV will automatically switch on at that particular time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0129389_0130658 So he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0130658_0131316 then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0131316_0132153 And one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0132383_0133347 The remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV, television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0133347_0134209 and this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T in alphabet for more compactability.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134353_0134816 and and and there's one more point which I noted it down
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134816_0135989 The material which is used for remote should be human friendly. It should not cause any skin disease or something, some allergy to either children or to an adult person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0135989_0137124 and it can have an alarm clock. A person if somebody wants to get up at around 8pm and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137124_0137523 and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a limo.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137830_0138232 As Janhvi said the buttons can be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0138232_0139184 can we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139184_0139773 So even in the dark, the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139914_0140886 and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0140886_0141138 He should not be harmed in any way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0141528_0142412 and findings. I found out different sites that there are different remotes which can be used.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0142412_0143443 There are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities. There are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0143608_0144513 So you have different types of remotes with different light source which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145325_0145407 ねえ、すいません
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145632_0146151 and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for multipurpose use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0146201_0147193 no like it can it can be used as a TV control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing and it should have a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147193_0147988 and then to save electricity there should not be much more lots of circuits and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147988_0148961 And if a person, if parents want the television to be switched off by 10 o'clock, then it should be switched off at 10 o'clock automatically.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0148961_0149228 so that nobody else comes later and uses it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0149547_0149771 Yeah and then you can use a timer as well.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0150148_0150198 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0157657_0157792 TV, televizyon gübüsü.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0169295_0169374 You know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0173696_0175737 Generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from 10 to 40 and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people with who have nervous problems
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0176300_0177029 In a family there will be an aged person, children and a middle aged person but they cannot buy three different remotes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0177029_0177625 They would like to buy just one which can be used by all the three.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0179221_0179323 I'll step into the light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0192775_0194536 But I have a doubt like will it be cost twice effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0195575_0195659 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0199939_0200079 within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0003972_0004279 Do you just put on my microphone here and I'll pay right with you?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007539_0007703 Okay, you want me to start right now?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007998_0008644 Well could you put my slides up because I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009682_0009830 for a long time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009830_0009886 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010847_0010963 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010963_0011958 Okay, well, I think we've introduced ourselves, so the functional requirements is part of my goal, but why don't we pass right to the second slide?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012069_0012334 That's where my discussion starts.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012334_0013030 Alright, well, since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013030_0013619 I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013619_0014672 And the reason I just put that there like that is that in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0014672_0015069 You know, you can say anything you want, no matter how silly it sounds. You know, it should run your car.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0015069_0016531 it should heat up your motor, it should turn on your CD or whatever you want it to do. And then as we go on, what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0016562_0017633 So I'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's going to be to add a feature or how expensive it's going to be or if your time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0017633_0018011 It takes five years to develop this. It's just something we can't do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018011_0018921 So in the beginning, you just have a big puddle of things that we... anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018921_0019778 And then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer, we'll try to then prioritize those.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0019778_0020047 So that was what I meant there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020047_0020887 And as I said on the slide there, consulting the industrial engineer about that. And the other thing is time is really going to be as important as money.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020887_0021322 because if we're going to sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021364_0021801 25 euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021801_0022222 We want somebody to see it and think it's, I just gotta have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022222_0022406 and take out their wallet and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022406_0022828 So it's got to be really attractive, but it's got to go to market by September.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022828_0023485 because anything that you don't have already out there in September, showing it around isn't going to sell for Christmas.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0023485_0026102 And then I'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color. I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026131_0026563 So we're coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026563_0027101 And I'll be coming to you to tell me what's going to make somebody take out their wallet, you know?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027101_0027851 what's going to really be what they call a sizzle, because we've got to sell the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027851_0029054 A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just going to take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029054_0029206 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029486_0030625 I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at, the whole house idea really isn't going to be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0030625_0031175 So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we could suggest anything.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031175_0031708 I'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031708_0032924 not something like whole house control. And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0032924_0033501 at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work, the TV, the VCR, the
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0033501_0034381 the stereo set, maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034381_0034459 I had to wind up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034568_0034638 something
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038132_0038212 Of course, Senna.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038308_0038440 Bye! End it!
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0041820_0041895 I'm only gonna be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042700_0042838 Alright, thanks for that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042838_0043738 Um, alright now, other things that I found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0043738_0044093 because a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044093_0044900 And that was 34% and even more important, the thing that we did address in our last meeting, that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044900_0045388 So those are two things that we definitely do want to address.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0045388_0046099 We want to make it as simple as possible. We want to make it obvious and intuitive to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0046099_0047160 and then the things about finding it, we talked about the light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047160_0047734 And I think that those are things, after my research, that we definitely want to try to incorporate.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047734_0047873 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047965_0048737 Okay, so my personal preferences in this project are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0048737_0049169 That is the selling point, the thing that's going to make it an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049169_0049802 because once there's no be back, well in sales they always say, you know, be backs don't come back.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049802_0050107 If somebody says, oh, I'll come back and get it next week, you're dead.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050107_0050250 They're never gonna come back and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050250_0050983 You've got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now, now, now. Now is a big word in my book for selling this thing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051054_0051832 And in order to make it really saleable, we've got to shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051832_0052603 We have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion. So that's why I'm saying simplicity is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052603_0052895 Finding it's important obviously. You can't use it if you can't find it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052895_0053566 So, you've got to concentrate on the features that help you find it. And I've already said this several times, but I put it down in writing here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053566_0053911 should be an attractive impulse purchase at 25 euros.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053911_0054476 So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it, they say, ah, 25 euros, I'm not going to take that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054476_0054921 That's to be so great that they're gonna say, oh, 25 heroes isn't much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054921_0055696 And then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0055696_0055895 Okay, that's about it for me right now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0071650_0072292 Yeah, that's already been eliminated by management, so off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0075399_0075459 Integrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0083710_0083926 Yeah, well, that's been it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085300_0085700 So it's good for marketing and fun shades.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085700_0085982 I can say that won't add too much to the budget.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085982_0086172 No, no, he said this.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0087557_0088267 Do you think there's any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088416_0088504 I'm not gonna miss you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088504_0088682 I think we will have to do it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0089144_0090328 Because we had something sort of sexy for adults, we could have something sort of silly for children. Like an animal shape. Or an elephant so they can remember where it is.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0093904_0094930 I think that's something that we'll have to discuss with the user interface person because I think there's a lot of arguments to be made for one button for one feature.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0094930_0095705 I think one of the things people were complaining about when I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0095705_0096316 The changing modes was something... I mean you and I, all four of us, we work with computers all the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096316_0096672 changing modes is nothing for us, but people who
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096845_0096954 You know and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0097752_0098520 It's the kind of thing people learn by feel. You don't feel the mode change.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0098520_0099118 So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be helpful. Yeah shapes are also different.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0099118_0100076 You know, like a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100076_0100251 but we'll get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100587_0100676 That's right, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100676_0100766 Now that's a good pause.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0102143_0102905 Yeah, that's a good one, because the clock could be really friendly. When is your favorite show coming on?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103084_0103293 Yeah, and a lot of times there's not a clock on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103293_0103559 and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103559_0103774 Yeah, that's good. The cock is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0114715_0115075 So we should visit this site and have a look at what's up there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116205_0116375 So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116540_0116634 Okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0117284_0117607 Did you go back to that slide where she had that dust slide up?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0118011_0118110 Yeah, okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0135833_0135885 I did.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0137802_0138030 and alarm clock and as Janhvi said
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166276_0166737 Well you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166737_0168094 So if you design something that's very attractive to children, the mommy please, mommy please, we want it now, we want to go to the store and see it, that has a lot of marketing pull.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169274_0169314 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169762_0169980 We make a bit of a shit plan.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179007_0179132 What about the electronics?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179132_0179323 That's not really going to change much, is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179406_0179688 That won't change much, will it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179808_0179911 The question...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0184362_0185216 That's right. And can we, is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185216_0185658 or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185658_0186120 The question. The same electronics and basically all that's going to be different is the plastic case.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186120_0186575 and in that case we could probably... molded plastic isn't all that expensive is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186575_0186754 Oh, and there's an industrial facility.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0188725_0188880 There's a real idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0191056_0191112 If they're never
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0192228_0192322 An alternative package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0194615_0194841 I think the idea here is to do this
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0197756_0197905 Finish making that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0198506_0198918 Well, we may have to come back to it at our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0200114_0200201 ok
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0201029_0201159 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004216_0004299 Hello everyone!
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004479_0004718 How are we doing?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004927_0005625 First we're going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0005625_0006870 In the last meeting, the marketing manager had presented her method of working, meaning gathering suggestions
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0006997_0007904 from everyone to see how she best could market this product within the budget that was given.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008138_0008820 In general, the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008975_0009457 It's also an item that people lose a lot.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009457_0009814 So we should address that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009814_0010097 And of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010196_0010416 that is very simple to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010556_0011343 In addition to that, to make it sell, of course, the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011343_0011676 or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011777_0012321 so that the people are buying it now because in particular way smaller items
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0012321_0013004 That's a very important fact. Because if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013079_0013750 Also mentioned was it should have a very short learning curve.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013868_0014315 and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0014486_0015156 Our technical manager has then said that he feels it should have a chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0015303_0016034 that has infrared bits and it has an interface that controls the chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016141_0016636 Therefore messages will be controlled in the same manner.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016636_0017055 There should be extra features like lit buttons, maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017055_0017265 If too many buttons are pressed,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017385_0018387 child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018493_0018818 You could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018818_0019144 Also mentioned was maybe different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0019338_0020355 So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infrared bulbs, battery, chips, wires and maybe some kind of a holder.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0020468_0020854 for the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0021026_0022213 Francina, who is our interface designer, has mentioned that the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0022213_0022856 of course should have an on-off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023009_0023561 particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't watch a channel that is undesirable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023561_0023683 It should be compact.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023683_0024093 Her personal favorite was it should be T-shaped.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024093_0024326 and maybe having an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024326_0024794 and the material should possibly be of non-allergic nature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025022_0025699 The different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025804_0026480 Maybe it should have an electricity saving feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0026583_0027722 and even possibly a timer so that people can program their favorite program right from the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0027908_0028452 Are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Yes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0028659_0029094 Okay, then we are looking for three presentations.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0029094_0029975 and I don't know whether the order matters much. I don't think so. So whoever wants to start first. Yeah okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0030610_0030733 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0031419_0031552 Hmm, what's that?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0032145_0032361 And that's number two, right?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037338_0037392 Nein, nur das.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037392_0037633 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037796_0037911 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037911_0037995 Yes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071148_0071367 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071367_0071681 Any comments on her presentation?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074229_0074411 I don't think I've ever done that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074936_0075179 No, I think these are her presentations.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0075179_0076320 but as far as the decision making we have to come back to that later. I just wanted to know whether anybody had anything to add to her?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076418_0076442 Merci.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076735_0076947 Who wants to go next?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077090_0077226 Okay and during this
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077711_0077778 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0078760_0078872 components design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0098452_0098489 Oh
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130408_0130522 And you have more pictures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130522_0130739 We have five minutes to the end of the meeting.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134033_0134113 Okay, well thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134248_0134577 Any particular comments by anybody?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0137498_0138269 We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her. Okay, you're right. My first question.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0138383_0138486 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0151820_0152029 uh that's
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152200_0152485 concludes the presentation of everyone.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152485_0153203 And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0153362_0154015 So what do you think on the concept?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0154112_0154194 Afternoons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0156370_0156455 That could be our...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0158654_0158929 well you teach you have to teach to get it right.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0161998_0162607 Okay, before we get too far off here, the components of the concept is the energy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0162607_0162897 what kind of energy do we foresee.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0163699_0163926 okay then chip on print
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164176_0164267 and the case.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164267_0164756 And I think we all agree on the case, we want to have something maybe bright, colorful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0165479_0165739 Jenny designed compact and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166028_0166645 User interface concept, interface type supplements.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166960_0167250 I will be your area, I think.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0167951_0168227 I guess for yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0168722_0168921 I'm not sure what they mean by supplements.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169317_0169382 I'm like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169701_0169802 speech recognition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169802_0169923 Right, right.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171259_0171654 Our next meeting will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171654_0172685 And the ID is to... This is the individual actions to be taken until then. To have to look and feel design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0172871_0173724 And the UID is supposed to come up with the user interface design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0173847_0174301 and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0174301_0175288 In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay. It says here.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175288_0175809 You will receive specific instructions, will be sent to you by your coaches.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175954_0177111 If you have any questions, you can always contact me or your coach, I suppose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0177327_0178398 So I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in 30 minutes according to our timetable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0178752_0178832 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0004829_0004877 Good
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0040287_0040407 Gut. Es geht weiter.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077014_0077070 more handy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077209_0077282 This
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077830_0078010 the next one. So...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0078010_0078122 It was the one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0079698_0080715 This time I am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0080715_0080945 Can you go on to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081013_0081722 I have just briefed down few components which we require for the remote control construction
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081722_0082429 The first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit, battery etc.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082452_0082974 It can be a plastic one, hard plastic so that it can be strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082974_0083549 even if it falls down then it doesn't break.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083549_0083753 So it should be strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083753_0084199 and there are no harmful materials used in that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084199_0084349 and it should be recyclable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084523_0085230 and also using of colouring compounds like if we want to have different colours
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085230_0085823 blue, red, green. So we have to use some colouring components.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085884_0086444 and the second important thing is integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0086444_0087057 We can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087057_0087957 If it is not efficient then everything is going to be less efficient. So we should have a highly sophisticated one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087957_0088348 and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088348_0088688 Suppose if it is 38 degrees outside, 40 degrees outside.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088688_0089579 it should be able to resist the temperature high temperature and low temperature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0089579_0090048 And it should be equipped with a timer and alarm facility.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0090140_0092106 And the other component we have in the remote controller is a resistor, which is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor, which is a battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092199_0092360 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092605_0093019 a diode, a transistor, a resonator.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093019_0093692 These are all the technical electronic components which we have to use in a remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093692_0094109 battery, I would like to suggest one thing. If we
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0094162_0095016 If we will be able to make a rechargeable battery, then we need not go for a high performance battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095016_0095434 Even if it is a low performance battery, it can't charge much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095434_0095628 it's not a high voltage battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095628_0096094 then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096094_0096748 So in that way we can cut the cost but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096832_0097215 and we have a circuit board in a remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097215_0097446 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097446_0097754 and how it works how the remote controller works
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097754_0097852 when you press a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098639_0098714 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098714_0098982 When you press a button, when you do that,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098982_0099792 You complete a specific connection. That means when you press a button there will be a small circuit underneath the button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0099792_0100604 and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0100604_0101397 Suppose you have pressed channel 1 button, number 1 you have pressed, then the chip will know that the number 1 button was pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101397_0101770 it produces a more score line signal specific to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101828_0102181 Every button, every individual button has its own mode score.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0102181_0103151 suppose the user has pressed button 1 then it will have a specific the circuit will generate a specific Morse code to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103151_0103896 and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the LED which translates the signal into infrared light.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103896_0104247 You have got a signal by pressing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104247_0104633 that Morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104690_0105088 Now that signal that MOS code has to be amplified by the transistor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105088_0105449 that is the use of transistor V which we use in the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105449_0106205 It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the LED and which translates the signal into an infrared base.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106205_0106914 The sensor in the TV can see the infrared light and seeing the signal, it reacts appropriately.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106914_0107871 that when it sees the amplified Morse code signal then it will know what action it has to do.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0107871_0108100 then it will do the appropriate action.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108100_0108406 so this is how the remote controller works
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108608_0108739 Can you go to the next slate?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108818_0108950 Yeah, I have few pictures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108950_0109602 when you look at the remote controller, this is a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109602_0109775 and do next 3 pcs
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109916_0110176 and we had a few buttons and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110176_0110781 and if you open the remote controller you have this circuit board and few electronic components
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110781_0111206 Like you can see a chip there which is having 18 pins.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0111206_0112252 and also a capacitor, three resistors and also resonator and the diode transistor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0112409_0113165 the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode transistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0113411_0114156 Yeah, you can see the TA 11835 labeled chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114274_0114940 You can also see the green, two green things are, they are resistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114940_0115695 and just beside that you can see a transistor and cylinder shape that one is a capacitor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0115695_0116236 and also there are resistors, sorry there is a diode.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116236_0116386 and you're good. Go on to the next.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116498_0116663 so this is the circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116663_0116861 the green one is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116861_0117506 Actually building a circuit board is pretty easy and also it's inexpensive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117506_0117850 It costs less than what you print on a paper.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117850_0118489 because when you are building some circuits and also wires
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0118489_0119311 it's better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a bulk and it's just printing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119311_0119607 nothing like you know you don't need to use wires and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119607_0119842 It's not exactly wires we are using.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119842_0120132 it's just printing something on a board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120132_0120531 Those prints will act as wires and circuits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120671_0120979 So that green thing is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120979_0121709 And also you can see there are access for buttons like when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0121709_0122749 the circuit under the button will be activated, it will get some signals from it and it will send the signals to the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122749_0122929 integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122929_0123067 in good things.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123124_0123528 These are the circuits underneath the buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123528_0123781 Can you see the black round marks?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123781_0123904 They are the circuits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123998_0124113 Excuse me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0124113_0125076 and we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0125076_0126004 A push button requires a simple chip underneath it whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126004_0126666 Like for roles we have to go for a sophisticated and full, complete ship.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126666_0127306 And as energy source we offer a basic battery, more engineers a hard dynamo.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127306_0127968 a kinetic provision of energy. Modern watches that you shake casually to provide energy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127968_0128534 so that also we can have in a battery or we can use solar cells.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0128993_0129358 The product can be delivered in different cases.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0129358_0130124 Usually the case is uncarved flat that we see usually a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0130672_0131029 Yeah, maybe I have just one more slide, I think.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131214_0131805 Like we can have materials such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, but titanium we can't use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131805_0132583 and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the print.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132583_0132975 It includes the infrared sender.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132975_0133592 and for the movie just to develop a sample sensor, sample speaker.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133716_0133830 Hmm, yeah, that's it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133922_0134042 or from now.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135352_0135967 No, no, no, the scrolling was different, like you can go for switches, like buttons or scrolls.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135967_0136326 which we used to do 10 years before, I think.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136326_0136783 now nobody uses it because you need a sophisticated chitin doll
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136783_0137172 so I think it's better we go for ordinary buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0137172_0137325 Push buttons. Push buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0155951_0155980 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0156682_0157287 I agree with that. But I am very much doubtful how far it will work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157287_0157809 because speech recognizer has its own issues.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157856_0158196 It's not distance problem, it's recognizing a person's voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158196_0158744 like maybe different people will be having different voices so it will be like everything is so different.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158875_0159324 So to get a good recognizing system it's a big thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0160727_0160814 Yeah, but I'm not.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0164914_0165021 I'm not trying to
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0165087_0165205 history.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167428_0167885 like the switches like we use buttons for user interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167992_0168050 Push buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0169896_0169937 Oh
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0178831_0178919 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0021374_0021488 Interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0029733_0029926 We're going to link in the description.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0030545_0030674 on my stomach please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0032580_0032667 Back to spin three.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0033756_0034196 As an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034196_0034711 how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034904_0035003 Next, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035170_0035689 Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035689_0036777 This message could be a switch on off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching on to a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0036777_0037125 like you can have the numbers 1 2 3 4 up to 9.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037733_0037769 But if you need it
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037914_0038091 Yes, nine numbers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0038297_0039313 And then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0039580_0040685 then it should have a next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0040685_0040793 Next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041040_0041593 Then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041810_0042459 Then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0042459_0043076 For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0043076_0043969 Then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044193_0044767 Then there should be some buttons which can control features like the color,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044767_0045303 color of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0045677_0045873 Now there should be a memory switch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046272_0046472 There should be a mute button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046472_0047301 Suddenly if a viewer he gets a telephone call and if he wants he doesn't want to switch off the TV.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0047301_0048236 but he can reduce the sound, he can bring the volume down and he can watch, while talking he can watch the TV.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0048236_0048884 Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049045_0049572 It's an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049852_0050709 So remote can be can be designed which can have the voice recognizers. You can record your own voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051039_0051517 which can be recognised by a voice recogniser in the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051517_0052189 If you want to see the 9th channel, just say 9th channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052189_0052811 the remote will automatically switch to the 9th channel
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052811_0053586 So the TV will have some recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0053586_0053930 So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054117_0054527 So this is one of the interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054720_0055229 a very simple interface which has all the important features.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055337_0055442 Please next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055573_0056263 These are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056263_0056861 So sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056861_0057360 So you can you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057360_0057596 Even a kid can use that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057596_0057810 So can you go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057900_0058505 Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0058505_0059282 And this has multi-purpose use it can be used for TV it can be used for cable satellites it can be used for VCR DVDs and audio.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0059519_0059766 And this has inbuilt voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060165_0060335 getting marked at the next line.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060335_0061014 Yeah, now this is an interface for a child for a remote which a child can use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061014_0061664 This is user friendly, it's very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061664_0062022 and this comes with different colors, different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0062692_0063723 and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0063815_0064076 attractive child interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064655_0064779 Excellent piece.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064779_0065694 Now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066114_0066729 We could lose that in a minute. This is a very big enough...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066729_0067250 This is a Jumbo Universal Remote Control and it's impossible to misplace or lose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067389_0067648 this is one such interface which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067837_0068986 and the personal preference would be to incorporate speech recognizers which will respond to users voice for a particular function
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0069197_0069294 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0072873_0072896 R.I.P.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0075564_0075593 por que
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0108382_0108416 X
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0113958_0114005 I'm going to go ahead and get started.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0137241_0137310 or is there?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0154766_0155184 Yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0155994_0156254 This could be a one feature which could be sellable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159121_0159844 It's like you are recording a question already.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159844_0160229 and then you are expecting an answer from for example you have a TV system.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160229_0160992 I am the user and my family members are the user. I will already record a question like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160992_0161438 Good morning, like around 8 o'clock I want to see the news in the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161438_0161756 So I'll say just good morning and the TV will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161756_0162029 it will recognize my voice and it will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0164881_0164970 Forgotten locals.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0165119_0165290 and it is strong, compact.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0167885_0167954 Verspäten.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0168978_0169657 some people use different types of features buttons. yeah like mute buttons or like Christmas
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0178837_0178885 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0028468_0028599 I think that pretty much is it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065632_0065748 You don't know me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065748_0066286 I could lose that in a minute.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072037_0072494 Well, looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072494_0072892 Um, what? No suggestion is bad.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072892_0073178 but we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0073178_0074006 I don't think that we can get... The T-shape is good, the child one is good. It's a too big to miss place, I think it's just funny.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074006_0074814 I don't think that's going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074814_0075047 It's gonna be a little bit. No, I think
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075159_0075207 Yeah, but...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075476_0075617 I have to come back to that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0076254_0076643 No, I think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0084611_0084654 Good point.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0128530_0128654 It's interesting.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0134648_0135275 On the scroll and the push button, you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0137109_0137442 We'll just go for push buttons. For the interest of cost.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138188_0138348 We're right to my first and my next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138641_0139591 My method is, I'm interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0139591_0140222 So I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140222_0140793 I spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140793_0141346 And then when I'm out in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141346_0141886 I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have, and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141886_0142148 And I would encourage you all to do the same.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142148_0142685 And my findings from this is that small is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142685_0143016 People like something that really fits in their hand.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143016_0143144 Simple is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143144_0143839 They don't want to have to squint at small print. They want buttons whose functions are obvious.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143839_0144355 and they want as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144355_0144558 They want each button to do something.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144558_0144676 And eye catching is important.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144676_0144923 It's gotta look cute, it's gotta look appealing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144923_0145145 Go ahead, I'm trying to finish fast for you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145145_0145782 And our preference is, as far as I'm concerned, we've got to get to the market before the competition.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145782_0146250 Ours has to look really great and it has to come out before the others.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146250_0146840 so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146840_0147354 and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0147354_0148032 If we try to sell people it has too many great features, the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148032_0148872 So we've got to narrow our selection down to two things I think that we're going to say are really great about our new product.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148872_0149481 And I've been looking around at what designs, every year different things are popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149481_0149939 And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149939_0150324 And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150324_0150982 They're more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150982_0151470 So those are things we want to look at as far as saleability of the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0154519_0154897 You wanna try to come back to yours? Yes, I would like to...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0155631_0155945 So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156276_0156529 Yeah, that could be our star feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156529_0156793 That would be really good. Yeah, I agree with that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0157714_0157817 distance problems.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163036_0163363 I think battery. I think we all agreed on that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163363_0163659 That's going to be most cost effective and the best thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0164816_0165230 bright, colorful, trendy, trendy design and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0168945_0169070 So I was like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169264_0169694 Yeah, or like Christmas tree, which would also be a supplement.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169694_0169928 Our speech recognition feature is something.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0170012_0170726 Okay, so why don't we put down speed-tracked ignition if possible, pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0176912_0177406 Where were they hiding?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0003938_0004133 Well, hi everyone again.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0004324_0005440 Like before, I have to read you the minutes from the last meeting. And so, here we go.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0005591_0006464 It was discussed in the last meeting, which was opened by the presentation from the interface
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0006567_0007903 designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the TV.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0007903_0008979 It should have 9 channel buttons, an X button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, color, contrast, sharpness, etc.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009020_0009435 We have a memory switch, a mute button in case the telephone rings or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009435_0010653 Speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to be integrated in this new remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0011091_0012013 It should be child-friendly design with few buttons, colorful, maybe with star-shaped or other shaped buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0012013_0012926 She presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013217_0013332 It's a hate.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013485_0014410 But her very personal favorite, really, she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0014410_0015315 The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0015315_0016438 She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colorful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0016564_0017116 It should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0017284_0018010 She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated in the system.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0018010_0019144 Technically, this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode, transistor, resonator, and if possible, a rechargeable battery.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019263_0019471 and of course the circuit board.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019599_0019852 and how it would work, so you press the button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019852_0022001 the chip is Morse code related, relates to the generator amplification. And the circuit board is very inexpensive to build. And so she thinks this is a great feature to consider.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022216_0022696 She would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022804_0023264 The scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0023384_0023891 should be battery operated and of course you would have the special cases.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0024040_0025146 The marketing expert who has to finally come up to market this product has been watching the competition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0025146_0026273 has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0026431_0026654 Easy to use and it should be eye catching.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0027036_0027745 From her point of view, of course, one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0028058_0029057 To do that, maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on, or in other words, on which our campaign could be built on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029213_0029697 Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029697_0030149 So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030288_0030916 It should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030916_0031126 She feels that's really what people want today.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0031293_0032097 The decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0032218_0033189 The energy should be battery, should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong and should have buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0033325_0033798 And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes, from the last meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0034072_0034535 Now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0042922_0043023 You don't sulk, do you?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0046331_0046436 And eat, eat.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052178_0052253 what kind of button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052399_0052600 a menu a one one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064279_0064480 Yes, the buttons are all raised, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064566_0064651 race and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0065317_0065522 We'll have two hands to open it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0067081_0067808 Yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you really, you don't have to first go like, oh yeah, here it's all in.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0069570_0069806 So if you're left handed or right handed.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072255_0072883 I have one question. Will there be anything written on the buttons?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072883_0073380 like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0073933_0074457 will have symbols so that the user really knows it doesn't have to...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0074976_0075613 But anyway it has to have some kind of symbols, text or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075772_0075805 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075924_0076155 Okay, I just want to make sure of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0076927_0077000 right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079005_0079329 What are our special features for the marketing?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079329_0079718 that's really the voice recognition, that's really unusual.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0080276_0080937 And then the other thing would basically be shape or practicality of use.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0081109_0081159 I will.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084293_0084575 Okay, now, having said that...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084864_0085297 No, this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0085297_0085576 Now we're going to talk about financing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086184_0086437 Bo to jest produkcja i nie ma właściwej informacji.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086485 that you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086604_0086809 But that's after the financing. Oh, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086872_0086929 You see?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087539_0087996 Okay, we had looks and voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087996_0088686 Okay now on the financing we bring up the... there it is.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0088686_0089440 Okay, energy source, we say that's battery, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0089637_0089762 Okay, now...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090085_0090281 So I guess we use one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090983_0091358 cellar chart you are trying to change the proximity
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091358_0091446 Oh, that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091530_0091813 I told you I could just change it in one night.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091913_0091984 Doesn't work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092731_0092979 Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Let's see.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092979_0093328 Okay, one. Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093328_0093443 I'll go away.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093443_0093918 So that's in the energy source, that's all we need.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093918_0094226 electronic simple chip on print.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094226_0094356 Is that what we're using?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094356_0094432 one of those
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094559_0094685 Come on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094685_0094872 Okay, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094872_0095121 Regular chip on print.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0095286_0095859 That's all we need, the one case, uncurved flat, single curved, double curved.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096704_0096864 double curved
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096864_0096935 one of those
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097223_0097444 Case Materials Supplements
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097444_0097645 plastic we said right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097826_0097962 wood rubber
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098268_0098462 But yes, but...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098722_0099264 That's just for the case material. Special color, so we're having that, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0099509_0099901 And then we have the interface push buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100368_0100500 scroll wheel now
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100500_0100770 integrated screen with LCD display.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101319_0101533 button up them in special colors
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101770_0101856 special form
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0102276_0102552 and special material rubber wood yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103051_0103417 Total 7.6, whatever that means.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103665_0103782 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104079_0104235 8.2
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104683_0104824 Let's fight!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104967_0105054 8.2 right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105236_0105427 So we look like we are
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105564_0105656 well within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0106093_0106272 I guess I should save this I suppose.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0107999_0108108 Ha ha ha ha
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108661_0108807 I just try again
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108807_0108969 I don't need computer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108969_0109144 I hear it, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0109683_0109836 Okay, fine.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110140_0110431 Okay good, so that's the good news.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110431_0110834 You gotta be popular.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111164_0111424 So that, I think financing was pretty simple.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111535_0112165 Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0114600_0114759 You want to go to the next slide? Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131419_0131783 I just realized one thing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131783_0132180 In the financing there was no room for our voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0132429_0133181 And I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0133554_0133711 820 yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134116_0134616 I mean maximum we have another 4.3, I mean 4.3.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134767_0135522 But we have no way of presenting that to management as a finished product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0135522_0136083 as a finished product and saying, okay, we said voice recognizer that costs so much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136202_0136654 So we just have to be aware of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136654_0137085 I mean and know whether the 430 will really cover that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0139488_0140779 I'm sorry to interrupt there, but I just remembered that there was no room for any special features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0140907_0141086 So beware of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141086_0141328 You want to go to the next slide? Marketing Expert?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141540_0141654 I don't know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141654_0141780 Yes, it was my last song too.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0144286_0144428 I ended that up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0145622_0145736 I think you can make it there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0148505_0148664 Yes, I think shape is one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0149756_0149886 You gave the full...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150247_0150389 Um, I don't know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150516_0150699 I think I would give it at least a 2.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152596_0152725 Call it right here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152988_0153157 I like the colors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0154776_0154971 I think I will give it a 2.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0156922_0157788 Well, it's also you can't really try it out. The other things you have more, are more tangible. So from that point of view, but...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0158088_0158204 I'll give it a 3.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0163765_0164417 Here is what we are looking at. Satisfaction on for example room for creativity.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0164981_0165391 Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0171858_0172740 Yeah, always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still, you know, we probably can't...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0172740_0173341 With this particular item we probably can't just add a whole lot of more things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0173341_0174395 We need to leave space, money-wise, for the voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0174986_0175438 So the question really is how do we feel with the project process?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0175438_0176658 Are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0176806_0177143 I think personally I'm pretty happy.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177258_0177401 It's a good question.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177613_0178216 And then the next question is, are we happy with the leadership of this project?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0178586_0179168 I think teamwork was very very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179398_0179899 and I think we are very happy with the means we used
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179899_0180315 We used whiteboard, we didn't use digital pens against all these things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180745_0180864 Yes, we could.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180927_0182201 It's maybe not in the best position in the room. Sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody. And I think from that point of view, we sort of ignored it a little bit.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0182303_0183135 because it was better positioned? Yes, I think so. I think absolutely. And fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183135_0183441 Did we find new ideas?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183441_0183527 So I think we did.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183727_0184471 I think we did in more than one respect and so I think we did very well here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184719_0184848 are the costs within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184848_0184947 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184947_0185232 Is the project evaluated? Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0185367_0185861 So, cheers!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186464_0186776 So I thank you all very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186776_0187153 I think this was very good and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187272_0187669 I think we did come up with a new product that's feasible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187669_0188086 feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0188280_0188412 So, thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0189421_0189660 I always get it on her, but getting it off is super hard.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0190479_0190598 Oh yeah, we have time-
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035625_0035939 So this is what we have made.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035939_0036376 This is a model of the remote controller which we are going to build.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0036376_0038147 This is in a snail shape, so it is attractive and it's a blue in color, bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons, so it is look wise it is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038147_0038429 and also compact in shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038429_0039128 and also it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039300_0039665 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039828_0041301 The material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and which is strong and also for the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0041445_0042426 The material is plastic and for the buttons it is a soft rubber. Oh that's good. Yeah that's nice and fresh.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0042426_0042999 Yeah because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043039_0043332 and then for the lead.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043332_0044239 for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0044413_0044878 and the buttons part will be explained by Fafsina
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0062030_0062128 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 50, 51, 52, 52, 53, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60, 67, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 74, 75, 75, 76, 77, 78, 78, 79, 78, 79, 79, 78, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0073522_0073605 These buttons were
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0074614_0074775 Going into an international market
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075161_0075253 It has to have somebody.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075541_0076079 that we can have on the case itself. It will be printed on the case.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0077042_0077318 The snail shell. He goes right back into his shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0078699_0078921 Oh my god.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0094238_0094352 that's what we're using.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0096277_0096347 This is the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0098501_0098936 I think that is for the case material.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103508_0103763 I think that's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103915_0104042 Beards.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0108986_0109101 I miss you. I love you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133675_0133765 I think as
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133822_0134090 We've still got four year olds to go to spend.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138186_0138315 Maybe that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138953_0139031 Yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0140240_0140346 included.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0148666_0148936 Okay, yeah, she was.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151175_0151364 Even I think it is fun.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151364_0151441 explain some more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0153266_0153342 Yeah, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0155570_0155756 Maybe two.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0158869_0159019 Three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165533_0165606 We get nervous.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165682_0166106 Yeah, include some more buttons and features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166106_0166342 we can make the buttons few buttons smaller
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166342_0167206 I think they are quite big. So I think we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0167206_0167460 if we want to have more features in that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0168404_0168517 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0169338_0169663 Instead of having two mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0177249_0177331 um
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0178437_0178646 No, don't do it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0180636_0180757 Yeah, we probably can.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0183540_0183677 레니!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0188433_0188521 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0189656_0189882 I think we still have some time left.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190111_0190291 You have
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190908_0190969 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0034881_0035112 This is the look like the button part eyelash.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0044970_0045542 Now we decided upon including certain features in our remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0045542_0046564 Now these features includes the signal emitting signal, it's the LED or LED, the infrared
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0046564_0046958 Now we have included the switch on and off button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0047312_0047703 Now we have included another feature that is the mute button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048112_0048363 on the side of the model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048363_0048767 Then we have included 1 to 9 buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048890_0049190 for controlling the programs, the different channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0049751_0050264 We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0050738_0051294 And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0051690_0052136 Now our model also contains a button which is called as a menu button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052259_0052337 मेनु बेट
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052416_0052502 menu
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052613_0052695 at the center.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052836_0053649 We have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color, sharpness, brightness
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0053896_0054005 of this picture.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054300_0054709 We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054854_0055307 Now this is a special feature which we have included.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055307_0055379 This button is
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055525_0056591 is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible. So if it is turned towards the right, it will take to the previous channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0056591_0056916 if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057045_0057353 to take the user to the previous and the next channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057662_0057755 swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0058428_0059316 Swapping is if for example you're watching the second channel and then you go to the 10th channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059316_0059420 Disrespected. Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059919_0060901 And at the end, this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and then it will act accordingly.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061477_0061773 So this is a proposed model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061773_0061987 Now the marketing expert has to
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0062120_0062796 give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0063532_0063628 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0067684_0067788 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0068745_0069236 No, these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons. On both sides?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069236_0069323 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069916_0069948 button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069986_0070147 the menu. Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0070404_0071261 These two are to increase or decrease the volumes and these two are to scroll the program channels
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0071408_0071569 PANDA
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0073384_0074001 Yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0074001_0074203 so that the user really
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076128_0076730 And one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076730_0076808 a shell shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076928_0077026 Right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0077093_0077224 He goes right back to the beginning.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0078678_0078822 Or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0096360_0096459 Sim, deu cão
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0098878_0098991 Oh, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0101930_0102129 Yes, we do have special phones.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0103669_0103947 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0104663_0104891 9 points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0108498_0108598 In the test
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0123878_0124032 That's what people are going to get.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0138250_0138356 Buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0140728_0140766 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0147847_0147931 Hello, I'm Suki.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0155305_0155381 I'll get three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165536_0165724 We can always improve.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165869_0165978 is features
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0171906_0172054 always bearing in mind that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0178402_0178668 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0180493_0180786 a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0185498_0185849 Celebrate!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0188429_0188486 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0190292_0190402 They say it's 40 minutes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0013037_0013522 She was challenged on that point.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0039502_0040024 You used to have all the buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0042228_0042451 Oh, that's good. Yeah, that's nice and friendly.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0046289_0046397 और एनी टी
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0052441_0052514 Is that your brand new?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053828_0053902 of the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053902_0053969 I'm this and I'm that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058041_0058417 the next channel in a numeric pattern or
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058778_0058833 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0059376_0059485 Okay. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0062821_0062982 Okay, well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063112_0063579 What I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063579_0064261 You can really hold it in one hand. You don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0064511_0065246 The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand, you can even reach it over here. So you don't have to turn it around.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065246_0065653 Turn it upside down. Move it up and down. I really like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065653_0066194 You really did a good job on that. My little designers.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066194_0066948 I like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066948_0067118 That's a really good...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067220_0067346 So that's been really fun.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067786_0068008 The color is very attractive.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068008_0068633 These buttons around here are the mute,
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068759_0069052 These the front buttons which are here are the main buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069159_0069314 on both sides of the wrist? Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069314_0069519 So you can push either one? Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069703_0069948 And this brings the menu up on the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069948_0070393 This brings the menu up on the screen. And the orange ones are...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071210_0071387 It's so often.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071387_0071489 Aapu aapu skruti
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071589_0071843 That looks like something I could sell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0072104_0072410 Okay and now I'm supposed to... I have one question.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0074373_0074971 Good point, because we need the symbols because we're going into an international market. We can't have anything that's language dependent.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075356_0075447 Symbol.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075447_0075544 text or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076158_0076217 One more feature
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076855_0077167 for the snail. We have the snail shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077167_0077358 He goes right back into his song.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077358_0078888 Well, you know, I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail was known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that, you know, that would be fun.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0078888_0079032 That would really work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0079632_0080257 I think voice recognition is our big selling point because nobody else seems to have that in this price range.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0080981_0081579 Yeah, well I think that everybody's going to say that remote control is practical.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0081579_0082128 I think we have to dwell on appearance.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082128_0082331 You're really gonna have the bad thing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082445_0082708 cutest remote control on the block.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082708_0083555 So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image, play with the visual, and then the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083555_0083713 And I think those are the two things to push.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083713_0083762 The look.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083897_0084011 and the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084011_0084185 They're going to be our two selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084556_0084761 I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0085663_0086259 Ah. But in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086517_0086566 Jasne.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086744_0086822 아오, 오케이
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086822_0087076 Sorry, sorry
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0087076_0087088 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0089556_0089598 insert
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0092477_0092677 Can you just fill it in the yellow boxes?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0096533_0096673 I guess it's still a curve.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0097975_0098164 because we're gonna have to soft buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0098936_0099082 Okay, that's special
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0100797_0101105 No. But we didn't put the clock in it after all.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0112217_0112448 Okay, I'll take my file down so you can bring it up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0113791_0113889 que je veux en demain.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114272_0114502 Okay, let's go just to the next library.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114688_0114846 Yeah. Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114846_0115717 Okay, well, obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first ask the big question, will it sell?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0115717_0116800 And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine-tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0116800_0117268 We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117268_0117552 and show the prototype to consumer research groups.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117552_0118356 We don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118356_0118628 So we have to get some input from those people.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118628_0119064 And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition. And, you know, we like it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119064_0119388 We think it's good. We're going to get behind it and sell it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119388_0119535 Next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119781_0120514 Okay, now the things that I was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120514_0120928 I wanted the shape to be biomorphic. I didn't want anything with angles and all square.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120928_0121283 I wanted to be comfy and roundy so I got that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121283_0121644 Size is small, the color is bright and warm which is what we wanted.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121644_0122239 We want the feel to be as soft as possible. We'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122239_0122686 even though it's going to be hard plastic it feels good in your hands so that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122686_0123207 And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0123207_0124124 So paradoxically, the other features, in other words, the look, the feel, and the shape, that's what people are going to get in the store.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124124_0124344 They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124378_0124658 So, they'll be our main selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124658_0125417 So those have been fulfilled by your prototype. And go ahead to the next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0125417_0126043 Okay, so the shape I think is a 1
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126043_0126301 It's really, really excellent shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126301_0127341 The size is small and these points are in the importance for the marketing. These aren't in how I feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127341_0127967 I think that it's plenty small enough to sell, but I think we're sort of right, the scale is one to seven.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127967_0128408 I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128456_0128620 and our color I think is great.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128620_0128975 The colors are bright and warm and really do a great job there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128975_0129552 And given the constraints that we had, I think we got it as soft as possible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0129552_0130090 And then functionality, I think you did a really good job on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0130090_0131014 Obviously we could have added different functions but then we disturbed something else. So I would say that we got to a 5 out of 7 on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0131014_0131379 So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133143_0133582 Well, um, we had what, 8 euros 20 as our cost?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133730_0134107 And so we've still got four year olds to go to spend.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0134602_0134830 Well, um... That's it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137150_0137939 Well as we know in today's technological world you can do just about anything at any price. The problem is quality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137939_0138351 So we're just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0138351_0139103 And it may not be the greatest quality, but it may sell anyway.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0139103_0139488 As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141252_0141534 Well, isn't this my last slide?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141607_0141656 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141656_0141844 Yes, it was. That was my last lockdown.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142274_0142365 I'm gonna kill you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142596_0142934 and I'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142934_0143589 and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now. So if you'll put my last slide back up there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0143817_0144241 I'm sorry, I forgot to do that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0144660_0144894 Well, because I can't remember what I put on there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145310_0145611 Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145761_0145853 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145937_0146050 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146050_0146395 So, now we're all supposed to say what we think.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146395_0146789 Um, okay, so, um, shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147227_0147341 I gave it one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147480_0147945 What would you rate? One being good and seven being the worst. It's okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147945_0148244 What do you think the shape is?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148244_0148497 one okay um that's it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148683_0149060 Okay, and yeah, she was one. Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149060_0149273 And how about on sides?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149676_0149785 on
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149863_0150178 I give it a 4. I feel it's just average.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0151479_0152066 You're the designer, of course you want to do that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152066_0152323 And then how about how we do it on color?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152668_0152819 I gave it a 1.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152819_0153059 I really like all the Sunsprite one-touch.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153405_0153617 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153617_0153839 And how about a single?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0154126_0154680 taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155051_0155410 Okay, I'm gonna do three, two, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155687_0155789 Czego? Nie wiem.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155919_0156691 And the next is functionality. Where I admit I was a little hard on our team here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0158686_0158775 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159432_0159557 Well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159803_0160156 Looks like we got ourselves a pretty good product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0160156_0161362 Functionality is the only place where maybe after thinking about maybe having another meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0161362_0161910 But otherwise, I think we're ready to go with this product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0162068_0162501 Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that you feel we should evaluate?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0167642_0168775 Well then again if we're going to do the speech recognition thing, there are going to be some buttons that are going to have to be added for that for the recording of the speech.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0168775_0169598 So that's where we're going to have to do, maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0169598_0170293 and then maybe we can do something with the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170425_0170535 the volume control
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170535_0170789 We can put that all on one button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170918_0171804 and consolidate some of the usage and see what we can do with that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0177170_0177576 I'm pretty happy with it. It's something I think I can market.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178213_0178697 I think you've done a good job. Yes, yeah. I definitely enjoyed it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178981_0179274 I think we work well together as a team.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0180322_0180811 Maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182205_0182421 and we used the slide because it was better positioned.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182537_0182670 I think absolutely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0183545_0183798 I think we should
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185190_0185260 Yes, yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185896_0186554 Today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them we have shampoo.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0188646_0188930 Watch out, I have my cord behind me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0190501_0191179 Yeah, we have time, but we don't have to... We were told we could end the final meeting at any time. Okay. Whenever we felt we were finished. Yeah, we didn't have to finish.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0191856_0192197 ...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0192517_0192575 There we go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447 Mom's gonna draw a cat too, so...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812 Let's try something else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060 Something different than Garfield.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246 Mine is a bit more skinny. Yeah, skinny.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553 I
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971 Well, it's supposed to be a cat.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118 I like it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106407_0106456 Error.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0107490_0107525 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0109049_0109083 destroy
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0126778_0126843 Yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256 They were all mentioned.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673 Morning. Morning.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955 See you all in your places.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125 Are you really sitting on the right place?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629 Yes, sir.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003264_0003336 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809 I guess I'll introduce myself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274 Everybody knows me. I'm a heartthrob.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415 아... 그렇지
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801 Let's start off with a little presentation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834 First I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037 You can see the photons there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797 They'll record your actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416 There are also some microphones there, but you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014 Because it will despair in you. Then it will die.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424 This is our project documents folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919 There are some notes in it already I see, documents.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145 I'll start with the presentation kickoff.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968 We can go to 5-bed and the mute is triggered.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227 Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for Real Reaction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529 It's a company in electronics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476 We put a lot of effort into the design of the product itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865 I'm Bart Buit, I'm the project manager, so I'll direct you through the project.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177 This is our agenda.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771 We have an open-air restaurant and a stall training and magic planter sketching class in.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902 Maybe I can sit down and take some notes or... Let's see...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442 Maybe you can take the maze? Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136 I don't know, it's not a lot of work, it's just, if you hear something, let it down, just let it down.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525 As you can see it's the opening, I'm going to do a stool tray.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917 I think this is point 5 done a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314 Have you all seen the corporate website already?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701 Have you seen any flaws in me?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949 I think I fucked one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019352_0019396 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753 to the Braxtons.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054 This is where I get it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335 Okay, not a problem.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274 But on the corporate information side there was real remote instead of real reaction. Oh yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934 Real Remote is not really the company we are, but...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335 Okay, what are we going to do?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735 our project AIM, which as you can see is a new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113 It has the original, trendy and user friendly.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811 So these are the points why we also hire June.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629 We hebben een marketing-expert gekozen voor de trendvolle en gebruikvriendelijke look.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214 And industrial designer, that's also user friendly and original.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776 And we've got our user interface design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899 It's what's up.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206 De mensen buiten de remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089 Project META is the three phases we're going through.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568 First inspection is done on a design, we fetch it over at meetings.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992 Na de visuele design, dan de conceptuele design en de detail design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683 I have some little indications on here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177 But I think you know it already by yourself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124 The industrial designer is going to work on the working design, components design and a bit of the look and feel design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102 The user interface designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept and user interface design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0031102_0032189 and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements specification, trend watching and product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473 That's a bit what you're going to do.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816 But that will be all worked out. All the amazings.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524 There we've got our first tool training.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263 We are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here, so it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870 As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here and the whiteboard.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579 In the whiteboard here is a little toolbar on this side.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682 Here are some questions.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790 you can save
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251 These features we don't have anything to do with, only undo you can undo a little.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563 piece of drawing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897 A blanking document for each person.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144 Select Pen Eraser
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423 Gotcha, we don't have to do anything with it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867 Then we've got our pen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005 This bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928 It's really funny because you can draw with it on this plate. In the... I think it is... Form of...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305 You can also select the current color and align it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673 But first you have to select the PEM function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011 Which we're going to work with in a minute.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261 Ok.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873 It's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings in there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081 Then
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513 Sure thing about documents
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935 We've got our shared folder, project link, project, that's it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279 Porque é que estou aqui nisto?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895 But you all found it already because there are a lot of documents in it already so you'll be okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697 And these are available on the smartboards as well. So if you have a document you want to show, you can just open it from the following.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097 Here is the sample toolbar.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751 So as I said, save, print, move back or forward one page.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947 Let's switch between the different colors.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479 And then we're going to try out the whiteboard
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119 So as you can see, Rego went to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785 Just to get a bit familiar with it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932 No, it's because you're running away.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351 Is everybody playing with the mouse?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721 We're going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367 and just some of the few of its favorite characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213 The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607 I can start from there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177 You can use this pen by holding it like a little child.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801 Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366 Another thing is you have to be a bit slow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895 If you want me to draw really fast then one is all up.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051895_0052898 We choose format, current color, I think grey is appropriate.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052898_0052990 Then the line went...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502 I think 7 will be nice
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863 Now you'll see my drawing capabilities.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193 That's very nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579 You have to go real slow
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800 He's trying to blow a dolph on his nose.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204 Sorry, I did it this way.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330 I am the light
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775 Now we've got another function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063 Okay, ready?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197 and I can't undo.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576 This is it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878 아 진짜
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429 I have to write down a few of his characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744 UGH!
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469 Ik heb een tekstil.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677 This is typically a new action, I think. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107 Maybe I should hold it a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408 That's the same thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073 I think that's it because if you want to do it like this, then you have to get a stripe.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319 I don't know. Just wait.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182 This is not mine.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320 Hayırlı geceler.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068929_0068980 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319 This is for the friend.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319 My characteristic about the door.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477 This way through.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194 So now I'm gonna hand over the pen to you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407 Go ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838 Maybe it's easier to draw with a smaller line width I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126 Because this is going a little better than I did.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669 It's a real Dutchie. Yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081 recognition.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551 Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084551_0084628 Чисто.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666 Ja, vielen Dank.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351 Yeah, yeah, I think...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283 Is it your cat or did you find him on the street?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495 That's it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818 So everybody knows how the whiteboard now?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508 If you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the whiteboard just ask and go ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677 So we're being helped. Helped by us.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990 So we've got the tool introduction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506 Move along to the project finals.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430 As you can see, for a remote control, the setting price is 25 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648 I'm so impressed
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946 Our profit aim is 50 million euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775 That's the least we have to get from our remote controls. So we have to work together to reach our aims.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717 We kunnen het internationaal doen, dus we moeten ons focussen op verschillende soorten gebruikers, verschillende soorten cultuur en verschillende soorten trends.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143 But that's all in the later stadium
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933 Our production costs can be a maximum of 12,5 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883 So that's also a point we have to keep in mind. We won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060 Go for it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394 So just try to remember these points.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393 Standard price 25, profit age 50 million. But more important is the international market we're trying to focus on.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770 and production cost maximum 12.5 euros
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275 So this leads us to our little discussion.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783 We've got about 5 or 10 minutes left for this cushion.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140 So I'm gonna sit down and say hi.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442 以上、アニメーションの話でした。
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622 I've got a message.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120622_0120698 Faggots
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118 Okay, that's a good time. So just on a side note
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952 Maybe you have to say the magic word. Yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208 Is it doing?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553 Maybe you have to just clap it down.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122828_0122914 Like up again
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568 and select you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123733_0123799 itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948 I need to spray it back on her.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102 What was it again?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649 And let's go to laptops.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124998_0126251 But some... Everybody has experiences with remote controls. I mean not the ordinary remote controls but also a little bit different ones.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555 I can use for other... No, wait.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0127905_0127958 BLEH
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777 Yeah, I've got one at home.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653 You can program, I think, eight different devices in it. You can use it for your television, anything else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326 and it also operates on infrared so you have a little device inside your room
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868 And you can operate it from the third or second floor. Oh really?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716 So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs and you've got a link to your TV on the second floor. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893 So that's pretty handy.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460 But I would need a
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401 I think if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, that makes it a lot easier as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133401_0133481 Let's see how it is.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757 It's good to remember.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250 Yeah, it's nice. Thank you. Thanks, Jerry Joel.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482 So we want different functions.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420 And we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720 But I don't know if that will exceed the production cost.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021 So this is something we have to find out, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893 and other functions for remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329 You can make it!
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137725_0137806 Show proof.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500 So these are a few things you can think of.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030 I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040 I can see the red stairs.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726 That's not usual.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142726_0142792 رأيي
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142928_0142988 Foi cariso.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680 Any questions about this presentation?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793 Kickoff presentation
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790 Okay, then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048 And then I can all work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405 Finish reading now
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955 En we kunnen allemaal werken op onze eigen projecten.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639 for a bit of help.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0076704_0076747 Shit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595 I'm just gonna drive it's head off.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089790_0089839 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352 You know what that is?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097503_0097536 Oh
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097650_0097761 I love you, Ben.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097848_0097894 You suck.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0098652_0098803 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099099_0099154 R.I.P.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539 Uh, who's the red blood?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802 Look at her, it's so good to see you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126436_0126474 НОВЫЙ РЕКОРД
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126779_0126875 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580 Okay, yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751 Now the second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137604_0137671 True.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110 Waterproof, alright.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494 Eh, she never had a lover like I do. I mean, uh...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0141037_0141123 Okay, roger that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004079_0004149 My life's fake.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004810_0004844 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353 Okay. That's interesting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0018307_0018353 What?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267 I guess I didn't pay much attention to it, but...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0021216_0021268 Oh yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0046928_0047006 That was interesting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892 I'm thinking about a sword fight.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0071206_0071246 What?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250 You
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613 And we're gonna draw a black line.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584 Okay, I love watching the lightness, but here we go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833 This is my, uh...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163 I'm yours.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320 My new dog names is straight in my butt
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084648_0084705 R.I.P.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084935_0084977 Oh
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049 This girl really slows the rate
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144 I really am.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316 And that's just a little thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191 Guys...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667 Garfield
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700 Она может это сделать.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0110215_0110298 Ruby
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120296 I need to get a lesson.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414 So just on a side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0123611_0123667 It's off now.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159 Well it was, huh?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124708_0124779 There we are.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126746_0126820 BALL IS
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508 kind of brought TV at home and a DVD player so they got like a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030 One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442 And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0130808_0130852 I live.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967 So I think you can definitely not see anything.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0134155_0134240 It's Geron-
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478 But that would be really good, if we could do that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534 I think it has to be shockproof.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045 My remote control tends to fall off.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381 Yeah, one other little thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763 I thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140875_0140940 So you can see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213 How much is left in the battery?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994 But they'll also really drag up the production costs. So we'll have to see about that too.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437 but maybe just a little bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0144083_0144179 I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0145529_0145582 this in a little while.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0147202_0147250 MAH
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232 Well, I think if we're gonna use a touchscreen, we're gonna go way above the 12.5 euros.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266 So it wouldn't be very robust
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531 It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777 Okay, I've got a presentation about the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003 First, about how it works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099 It's really simple of God.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285 Everybody knows how the remote works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468 You should press this button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999 The remote determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send a signal to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301 the TV switches to the frequency are not functional.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811 So, we've got the plate.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206 It's got conductive discs for every button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983 When the user presses a button, a signal gets sent, goes to the lab and transmits it to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340 It's a very simple device technically speaking.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614 So this is a schematic overview.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802 We've got the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017 Power source
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468 and when a button gets pressed it goes to the chip
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059 The chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324 When you press a button you can actually see if you pressed a button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094 Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441 Keep the inner working simple so it's robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841 I think we should focus on aesthetics, design and the user interface.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301 Because if you're going to use high tech materials, the price is going to go sky high.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105 You only have to design a remote once and if you use high-tech materials it comes back in every product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046 So it's, in my idea, it's gonna be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250 That's it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073 I think that if we put our marketing right, we can sell this just like... I don't know if you've heard about it in the news.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281 the elderly mobile phone.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249 If we make a remote control, just with that idea in mind, we could make tunnels along.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872 We hebben geen zin in het ontwerp, maar in de functionaliteit.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940 We just
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346 We changed our focus on the project. And I think...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636 We can sell this.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330 That's good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275 And besides that, if we're going to focus on elderly people, they'll have to adapt.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548 they're not used to using scroll buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860 So perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426 It should be possible, yes. Good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604 It's not too fancy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913 And if the remote stays rather small with you, Bubba.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902 So we're just gonna focus on the extras.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548 Like with your D-chain if you play so in Guinness.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974 I think we'll have to choose between the docking station and the screen, cause...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187119_0187191 So let's go back.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094 I don't think they have different television sets
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344 Na hivyo kwa hivyo kwa hivyo.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002 Everybody finds place again
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370 That's nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777 Okay, so this is our second meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100 and still fading
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726 And now we're going into the functional design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007726_0009245 The important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719 so that we can move on to the second phase.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959 The first is space.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273 Uh, first announcement.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705 There is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288 There's our ghost mouse again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018 That means that you can have a little trouble with air conditioning, that's because of this.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339 That's in ways V and E.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853 So it should be over in a couple of days.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438 It's going to be cold anyway so... I don't think we're going to need it. No.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584 Then our agenda.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747 That's pretty opening.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911 This time I will take the minutes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375 You're going to have a presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502 I love you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365 And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentations.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769 So I suggest we take about 7 minutes per presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354 And then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291 and then the decision on the control functions which you want to include.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511 A good 40 minutes for all of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947 So I suggest let's start with the first presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134 Who wants to be first?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337 Maybe it's easier if you... yeah, I think you will tell it in your presentation as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787 which function you have and what you're going to talk about.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054004_0054103 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516 Anybody have any questions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829 Let's finish our requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054829_0054905 Okay, that's clear.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160 Yeah, after the second.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571 Yeah, you can take your time.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860 We got the... Blamir Slimes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0058229_0058319 There it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638 on this world.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610 You want to ask questions about the technical functions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654 Well, we'll see.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727 Yeah, it's true.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130 Maybe we can first listen to your presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669 And then we'll have a little discussion about the requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351 I think it's going to... ah, it's not.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0102358_0102401 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926 Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we're doing right now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724 Ik ben projectmanager, dus ik ben hier om dingen op te messen en nieuwe behoeften te stellen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739 We've got to design a remote which is only suitable for a TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0106739_0107827 Dat is omdat het te complex zal zijn en de tijd om te markteren zal te groot zijn als we het voor meer functies willen hebben.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096 So it has to be simple.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600 Another point is we have to skip the data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108600_0109601 Omdat in de wereld van het toekomstig internet denken we dat datatext een ding van de verleden is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069 And it's a function we don't need in our remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739 Internet is also mentioned, just go in a function you can use
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063 Maybe also on televisions it will be available as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672 Another one is the customer is 40 plus.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578 Dat is de markt die we moeten beoefenen, want we gaan een nieuw product ontwikkelen die voor de jongere klanten is ontworpen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257 This is a bit pity for the marketing expert.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682 Because he was aiming on the younger persons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200 Dus we moeten een markt vinden die boven de 40 plus is, maar die ons gaat aansluiten.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648 remote control and the other way around
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449 And we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026 So it has to be visible in our design and the way our device works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572 And we have to be very clear on this point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721 So I suggest
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215 Let's have a discussion on the control functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0117632_0118925 We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091 against the no dead text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559 Yeah, it's a rush to get it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107 It's dead. Pretty.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383 I think we can not...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238 Ik denk dat we veel kunnen doen met het ontwerp en de gemakkelijke knoppen die ook worden genoemd.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970 Als we er veel oefening in doen, kunnen we een remote-controle maken met 2 of 3 knoppen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577 or just a remote which is suitable for the market you want to reach because it is 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305 And if you look in Holland, the whole generation of 40 plus people
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992 50 plus is de grootste deel van de hele populatie nu.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668 Don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456 People think that's the device I've looked for, although I didn't realize it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604 So, let's try it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136353_0136447 It's a big success.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731 Make a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367 We moeten ons niet focussen op de
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011 I simply think...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830 that the new products we're gonna make specifically design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726 are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0140860_0141918 Ik denk dat we moeten kijken naar de beperkingen die we nodig hebben voor die remote controles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419 Because what you told, channel selection is important.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809 Volume selection, power and tater text. Yes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055 No, we haven't voted yet. I think data text can be...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587 And the function as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776 But only if you don't.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134 higher the cost
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705 Because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well, but I don't think that will be a problem.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019 Where is the artist?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751 So I suggest... I think it will definitely...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374 Is anybody really against data tags?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956 and snap. We just keep the data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477 That's a good idea as well, especially for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786 Maybe we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123 make that, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725 Another point of advantage in our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587 If we make a button for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173 Voor ouderen die denken, ik wil een subtitel, dan drukken ze op de knop en krijgen ze grote subtitels.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064 So I think that can be very useful and our advantage.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617 Functionality should be few buttons, you said.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239 I think that's very important, we have a few battles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701 So to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318 But do you need a way?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219 You don't need it. Do you need the buttons for 1, 2, 0?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339 Maybe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911 Maybe you can use it if you want to switch from
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797 Maybe we can implement the scroll button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154 or a joystick like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450 There are other ways to...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649 If you look at telephones
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168 the Sony telephone as a scroll button which was very useful in searching names or...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0163536_0163590 Yes, sir.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236 This is the knowledge there.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076 We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display and if it's too much we can reconsider it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328 I think that one of these are in each button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493 or they're done.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813 The number of bovens. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082 I think it's very important in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763 You can make a very fancy design by putting the buttons in the right places.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041 If you have less burdens you can do a lot more with it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339 To operator jest.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393 So we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172982_0173031 PULSE RAY
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434 So you suggest we could better focus on, for example, the docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717 Like other functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210 instead of lesbians.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671 Do you think the docking station will...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115 is allowed in the budget we have.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504 It's not too far
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153 Because I think that's...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456 That's a good advantage point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363 If we have a fancy looking docking station or... That's a nice requirement
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0179483_0179580 against the ship.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0180046_0180112 I think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259 That's a good point.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868 You said they easily get lost as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939 so maybe we should implement the audio sign or something.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706 So you're gonna wear this audio signal. Should be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126 I think it's not too expensive.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279 uh another
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692 Oh and the LCD screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591 I don't know if that will raise the cost too much.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291 Still a bit too much, you know.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015 This is the LCD.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170 or just a normal screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190317_0190417 Small screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679 to some extra info.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060 I think that's a good idea as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584 It's the smallest thing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580 I just feel a bit unbeenful.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270 I think it should be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639 Let's see what did we say
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233 It should be fancy design, easy to learn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469 few buttons without like that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768 Documentation LCD
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087 General functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280 Default materials
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196452_0197489 Ik denk dat dat ook een goede idee is, want de mensen zijn niet bezig met een titanium cover of gewoon een plastic.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688 So, it doesn't really matter.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944 So, big problem.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316 and let's specify the target group
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966 Are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from 40 to 80?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687 Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above 60, maybe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201043_0201135 What do we want?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925 If we want to provide this with, for example, the telephone for elderly people, we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252 Target the real elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905 So it's still able to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535 And you're talking about 6280 for example.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642 and different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205642_0205713 Barbie?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008 We've got 5 minutes left.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0207008_0207094 and with
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360 in different languages.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085 Or you have to put a language that will be better understood.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464 It's better to put it on different markets with...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880 So that's the target.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323 Uh, then... A few... small things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808 Eh... che?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226 I will put the minutes in the project documents folder.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102 What we're going to do for the next meeting is the initial designer will do the components concept.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432 Here's interface designer using face concept and trendwatching
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212458_0213492 So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group, the requirements and the trends which we're going to go over now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955 And specific instructions will be sent to you by a personal coach.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385 So, thank you for this meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656 And I think me as a linchpin now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936 So that's a good thing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139 Okay.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775 Ehm, af en toe kun je het... Usual interface of iets.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117 for the techno function of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658 Um... Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215 I think we have used general functions of the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0059215_0060963 I've done a little research on the internet, not much information about it, about the interface.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113 I've been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844 Dus je hebt veel apparaten zoals DVD, televisie en stereo.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317 But it must be user friendly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041 So you can put a lot of functions in one.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353 Yeah, I'm just...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588 Everyone, remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064588_0064676 But...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479 Umm... Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318 Ik heb veel functies in één remote control, maar zoals je kunt zien is dit een vrij simpel remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014 Een paar knoppen, maar deze remote control heeft veel knoppen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502 People don't like it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347 What I was thinking about was keep the general functions like a yard
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665 Like the on off button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974 Keep it like a red burden
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596 Iedereen weet het, dus je hoeft niet te veranderen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183 My personal preferences.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706 Gebruik het display voor de speciale functies van de verschillende apparaten.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070706_0070792 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491 What I was thinking about was... You've got...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217 This is the remote control. You got here the general functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145 Zoals de on-off-knop, geluid, ik weet het niet Hier heb je een soort display
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438 There's a touchscreen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074438_0075919 Je hebt de function software voor je DVD speler. Voor het spelen, veranderen, etc.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452 We've got here real buttons for selecting a device.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0076586_0078034 So this balance for DVR. For every device you got a part display of buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621 Dus je hebt nooit alle knoppen op één apparaat.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045 So that's my idea about it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323 Umm... Yeah, and...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809 Yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945 So, that's game.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395 En de echte knoppen die we moeten gebruiken
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994 We better use quite large patterns for the eyes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294 Everybody has to use it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664 Of oude mensen, of jonge mensen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268 Dus je moet de battens heel simpel en groot houden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082833_0082896 Yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237 Dit was mijn karakter.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427 Yeah, I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751 You got quite a cheap touchscreen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069 It's not a quarter or something
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648 It's just one more... yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683 Ik heb iets gezien op internet, niet vandaag, maar een paar weken geleden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961 You got, yeah, quite a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685 kind of a touchscreen for
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287 20 euros or less.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515 So, it's possible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0089662_0089761 Yes, forever.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395 Deze deaf mensen hebben een teletekst nodig voor hun ondertitels.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506 So it's, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0150585_0150660 Poor Ellie.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617 I mean if it's only for TV, you're not
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713 We can't skip this place, so we don't need it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000 and it's left me so sick.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0018276_0018355 I think I'll go first.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813 My name is Frank Van Polen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965 and the market experiment.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091 Jó, rájön még nevesztek.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426 I've done some research
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302 We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556 We let them fill out a questionnaire
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822 We had 100 of these test subjects.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220 In addition we did some market research.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526 see what the market consists of
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664 what ages are involved.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460 Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753 Remote is being considered ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963 75% of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633 People passing indicated that they thought the remote was ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285 And an additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733 In addition, remote are not very functional.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332 50% of the people indicated they only use about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939 And 50% of the people indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028233_0028307 some things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894 Then we did some research to do most relevant functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664 Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867 The power button got a line.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117 En tøndertekskål er 16,00 kr.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222 So these are the most
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700 most important functions of a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927 Then there are some one-time use functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087 That's what I like to call them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550 There are the audio settings, video settings and channel settings buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074 which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702 Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943 168 times per hour
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502 And this is the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115 16% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874 The main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285 They like to use new functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438 but they also are very critical.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637 They won't spend their money very easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423 The users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731 They are not really very interested in features.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997 But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811 Well I think this indicates where...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336 I think we should make a remote for the future.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480 And this means we would
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984 I have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938 This also makes up most of the biggest part of the market, so that would also be where our main profit would be getting all the money.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342 This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614 The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioning thought that remote control caused errors high.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217 This is certainly something to take into account.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921 And 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate a new remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379 So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672 Besides of course that the remote must look very nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933 functionality
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727 As a lot of people indicated they only use about 10% of the buttons I think we should make very few buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175 This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670 I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162 Especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539 because they are used most and so they should be robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695 they shouldn't break down easily
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851 Then, as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, it might be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678 And I say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985 But it might be a good idea to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629 And this could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890 so you know where it is in the room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392 And in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0050571_0051711 Then, a surprisingly great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826 This was...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436 Mostly people in the age of 16 to 25.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805 but up till 45 it remains feasible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574 This will also greatly increase the production costs, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0053859_0053925 That would be awesome.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0054420_0054490 Questions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050 I think I should go to the... the spinning
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058050_0058150 Slide show.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058150_0058187 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837 Well, we certainly make a fancy design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089544_0089606 That is true.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819 Yeah, we can do that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796 So is there any discussion possible about any project requirements?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896 Yeah, because you're saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used anymore anyway, pretty soon.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197 and new TVs will have internet access on them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863 But I think if you're targeting people of 40 plus, the chance that they will have a DV with internet access
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278 within the next like 20 years is very slim.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133 In addition, people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543 So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840 I'm pretty much against it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878 Besides that, I think the market for 40 plus is like...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123983_0124063 Пришло
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873 But if I see this, I think we're just gonna go for another.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439 I think we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125565_0125638 I think we can do it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298 Yes, but it's not the biggest part of the...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973 Besides that, they're not very critical, so... I mean, they don't really care.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315 what the remote control is like.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688 They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961 I think that would be the case in the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414 16-45 age category
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077 Because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605 People of 40 plus... I mean... They wanted to work, but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976 As soon as it works, it's okay with them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610 if we make a
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275 But obviously the board tends to disagree.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146351_0146443 Das ist so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971 I think it would definitely be a bad idea not to include the text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038 I don't think that's really an issue anymore.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154163_0154263 Well, might be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858 I mean if it's only for TV, you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329 We need that 1 to 0 button. Next channel, previous channel.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821 up, volume down and some tether text buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360 Do you need a wig again ?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508 Thank you for that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740 I think many people like to use that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506 If you want to switch from channel 1 to like 35, you don't want to push the next channel button 35 times.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525 That is true but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089 I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238 and so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899 The TV would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220 I don't know if many channels would
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162420_0162508 Do have them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612 If any TV's out of that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063 But I think if you're gonna make remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497 having as few buttons as possible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313 Because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV. Which already only have the minimum number of buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540 I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001 That is true, but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you're making a remote control only to operate only the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897 Because if you have a remote control only to operate a TV, there's simply not a lot of buttons required.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553 There's not a lot of functions required, so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184 So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602 That would cost them a big marketing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173040_0173099 which was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663 one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845 Yeah, I think, I mean, we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153 But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428 Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research into
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733 what other people like to have in a
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039 like to have x-ray and remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443 Yes, well, 50% of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188 Yeah, that was what I suggested.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919 You have it on some phones too, which have a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252 and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0184328_0184403 so you'll know where it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701 I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn,
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355 And we're focusing on elderly people here, which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928 It might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, which would explain a button if you press it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068 which would tell you what it does.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747 And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen, but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469 Just a small screen of two.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307 I don't know what that would be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635 Those two fit into the...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437 I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0201108_0201183 I think if you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807 I think that would be, if we should do something like that, it would be...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198 I think it would be really good for the image of the company.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681 And I think there would be a good market for it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211 So we're able to really bring an innovative product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648 Yeah, do it again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196 I have to look into it a little more.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517 and with the little screen in it which explains the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794 I think it would be a lot easier to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113 adapted to different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0214713_0214775 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673 About the components design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321 For the energy source we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829 kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360 but if we choose for that option the docking station could become obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601 so I don't think it's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583 De fabrikant kan een vlakke casing leveren, een enkele of tweehoek casing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859 And it's really up to the design that we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347 This doesn't imply any technical restrictions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153 As a case supplement we could add a rubber bell, like an anti-slip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677 For the buttons we can use plastic or rubber.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326 And the chipset, it says simple here but it should be advanced because we're using an LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026 And as the TreadWatcher presentation shows, people like wood.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725 but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image unless we would start two product lines.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913 Fogsott falat, felső ábról!
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554 Well, the kinetic energy source is rather fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817 But, depends on what we want.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047 I think we should discuss that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706 For the case, the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523 And the chipset really should be advanced, because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0091523_0091576 That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992 Yeah, there are four options.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273 You could use the basic normal battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436 A hand dynamo?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719 But I don't think that's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113 You don't wanna swing before you can watch television? Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261 Solar cells
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667 But not every room is very light, so it's not a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099667_0099767 or the kinetic energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754 You basically shake your remote and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101742_0101816 That's true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402 I don't have any information on pricing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632 So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810 That would also go for the LCD screen then I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165 a bit higher percentage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714 And that's the best choice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947 Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100 so it's got to be advanced.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061 I don't know. You didn't learn?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305 I'll have to research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060 Well, the general, like most older remotes are flat, just straight.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699 And our manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved cases.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622 It would just only affect the form for as far as I know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003 So it's really just up to the design department what we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236 It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537 Pick one you like.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534 I think we should start by choosing a case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785 Because that's the basis we're building on.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445 Joo, ruotsalainen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151 Got this flap case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358 From the side so it's right along here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993 There's a single curve so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like but I think it's something like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632 So this type should be better for you or better should prevent a better stray injury a bit.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274 And the double griff... Something like this, I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600 Those are the three options we had.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185 It's more logical to have it on top as well, because like on your mobile phone it's always above.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030 Maybe you should just start on a blank page.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425 Good afternoon.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837 sweet. This is our favorite meeting already.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093 I hope you enjoyed your lunch.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346 And it's a good way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602 Uhh... Let's do it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309 Three.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844 Okay this is the second phase we are going to discuss today.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162 That's the conceptual design needed.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095 A few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409 conceptual specification of design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622 and also trendwatching
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580 These are hopefully the points you addressed in your presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215 Um, first, I'll show you the agenda.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404 First open
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621 Then we have three presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142 After that we had to come to a decision on the remote control concept.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383 Are you going to make it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600 And then we're closing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800 About 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221 So, let's get started.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747 Did someone encounter any problems during the operation?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182 25
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011182_0011256 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177 Then a little thing about the last meeting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469 These are the points we create on.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758 The requirements and the target market
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012758_0013769 The requirements are a teletext docking station, audio signal, small screen with some extra button information.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987 And we are going to use default materials.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661 Does somebody have any comments on these requirements?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611 These are just things we thought of, so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else, just let me know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755 Maybe you can work it out?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334 And we're going to target the 60 to 80 year old customers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402 So now everybody knows what we're doing. I suggest let's get started with the presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012 so you keep the same line up as last time
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452 Good luck.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736 Any questions about the trends?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365 Okay, I'm going to the nearest...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0091739_0091784 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432 So that brings us to the discussion about the concept
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825 So these are the points we have to discuss.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318 First
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021 I think we can talk about the energy source, since that's a...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908 has a pretty big influence on production price and image.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011 So
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927 I think first of all we have to see, it is possible to introduce kinetic energy, Richard?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077 Well, I think it's true. Elderly people just like to have everything in place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773 And I don't think they like a remote just laying everywhere in their rooms.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157 So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369 And also what you said.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186 You can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964 But I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441 So you have a button on your docking station that you can push and then it starts beeping.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214 And then we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the channels.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396 I'm wondering
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198 That's how I feel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438 Yeah, make sure you knock that board.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477 Good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791 G's here to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961 No, I think it's a good point.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054 I personally think the LCD screen we want to use with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507 It's just some extra information and it's easy to ignore as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757 But if you don't want to use it, you just don't use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889 and yeah I think maybe we have to discard the voice recognition
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431 Omdat het kosten zal vergroten.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946 And I don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372 So that brings us back to the energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126 If we don't have voice recognition, it won't use a lot of energy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356 So in that case we could use kinetic energy, but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466 that much cheaper as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353 Okay, I will just choose for the battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484 That brings us to the chip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847 We're using the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465 Okay, that's it for this trip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455 And then we get to the point of the case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119 Which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652 If you want to choose for wood or black and grey.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732 Удалось?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723 As we saw, wood is a lot more expensive to produce.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033 Maar ik denk dat het andere mensen zal aantrekken als ze iets exclusiefs hebben, wat ze op hun ouders kunnen laten zien.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275 Luke has got a new remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399 That's fair.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850 Redwood color was a lot more expensive.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038 Yeah, man.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515 I think really because...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064 It's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896 In certain cases.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413 I need to sell the case. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794 I think that's a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768 Because then you can advertise as well with give your grandfather a new place for his remote control or whatever.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796 Because it's something extra, it's something other remotes don't have. Which we can get a great advantage point.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959 So and then you can make him with color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145 black and grey on the canvas as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770 So you suggest we should design two different telephones?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830 on which you can apply different case covers. Well no, I think we should just...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767 So everybody is okay with the changing covers?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059 I think that's a good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555 It's a ninja in case call.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318 But the forum has to be... It has to.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677 It has to be possible to stand up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912 Oranges, I need to know just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416 En de beeld van de documentaire is ook...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749 Mam to w oddele, wyśmieniam.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158749_0158792 Allo ?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180 Yeah, you can do that. Yeah, keep hitting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369 It's okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722 So the interface
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048 Wat voor interface willen we gebruiken?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709 Maybe we can make a little drawing of it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144 on the board
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381 Does somebody have ideas for a forum or...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252 Yeah, use of humans will be a lot more difficult than that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349 But you have extra buttons.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495 so people can get confused
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086 Especially if they have the same writings on it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234 Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173340_0173417 on the same
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789 functions as the normal one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194 then yes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398 What?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748 Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr r
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292 Ummm... Yeah, we're good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482 There's the ice cream.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107 Uh... What's he think?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553 It's a close one, isn't it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069 No, it's not very handy I think.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520 Because the Pleasant Moon will be opposite of him.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813 No, it's the finger.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100 I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349 Maybe not. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117 But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262 I think the functions are
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981 that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589 Sam chcę.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961 I think we can just leave it the normal shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365 But maybe we have to
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783 Make it a bit more fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988 Well, I'm going another way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404 Zoom, tak... jo, rohadneme
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709 I suggest the single curve because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514 so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759 Because it's a bit of an angle.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0197954_0198030 I think so.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198497_0198586 Now it's...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153 Do you have it upside down? That's top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581 So get your buzz.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961 C'est quoi ça ?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386 But I think it's better to put the screen on top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339 So I just flip it 180 degrees around. And this plate is going here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592 If you can have this one, you turn it like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761 y la pide a usted acá
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490 Because maybe your hand is in the way if you get out of here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207860_0207900 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208151_0208188 What the?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288 Start out with a black belt.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838 I'm scared.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509 Here at this bay, I'm doing good things.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175 and then we can a little bit of here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421 Just that's for less than a minute, thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958 and then the rest of the business.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498 Yeah, it's still in here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344 I'm a bit more friendly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215951_0216031 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423 It's really nice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512 We've got a general idea of the concepts and materials we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081 So now for the next meeting we'll have to look at the look and feel design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575 It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819 So check out the Corpus website maybe.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286 The user interface design is the same, sorry
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527 and product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198 So the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771 but you're going to get your instructions I think, send by the coach
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642 I will put these minutes in the folder
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0221860_0223007 En dan gaan we proberen ons project af te zetten en een goed design te maken voor alle ouders en ouders.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394 Me too, right? Let's see.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233 I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or... I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361 And then you'll get a message.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778 Солидно. Без пьес.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026 Maybe this one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240 Okay, safe as well maybe though.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225592_0225685 Full nose kid.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653 好 沒事 沒事
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788 Smart boy. There it is.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235 So if you want to have a look at it, it's over there in the project folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764 And then I guess we'll start in 30 minutes again.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227926_0228011 Thank you good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943 Mm-hmm.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820 Um, okay, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237 Ik heb een beetje onderzoek gedaan in de ontwerp van Interface.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969 Last meeting I read about using a few builders.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534 So that's what I want to...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088 to do in our design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675 Een attractieve manier om de remote control te controleren
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406 Ik heb iets gevonden over spreeksreconisie
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725 so maybe we can use that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241 Yeah, and using a little display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584 Thanks
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263 Just to focus on the primary functions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0052279_0053386 So only buttons for sound on off, shifting up a channel or down shifting a channel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0054053_0055076 We hebben een aantal nieuwe en aantrekkelijke functies nodig die mensen aantrekken door het te gebruiken
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904 So, I like speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247 Just as we mentioned last meeting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736 And yeah, overall, user-friendly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079 Dus gebruik grote knoppen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127 Het is mogelijk een goedkope systeem te maken voor spreeksreconisatie.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078 Je kunt denken aan, als je je remote-controle verliest, je kunt het een gegevensignaal noemen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059355_0060394 And for shifting up a channel or for putting out the sound or something.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972 you can just give a sign, say sound off or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248 and uh...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666 television uh... the sound of uh... the sound of
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061979_0062017 That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062017_0062107 Yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754 Ik dacht aan een speciale button voor Subtitles, maar er is alleen één, om het eenvoudig te houden.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187 Met 1 druk op het knopje krijg je kleine asset titles
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204 Dus je krijgt grote ondertitels voor mensen die het niet kunnen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965 Hoe kan de reedsmal sweptijzer werken?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167 So, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977 En we moeten de generele buttons blijven, dus we moeten de buttons gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608 De on-off, sound on-off, sound higher, lower en de numbers 0 tot 9
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499 The general button, more general, one button for shifting up, shifting down, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0067499_0068547 We willen ook een klein display gebruiken om de functies van de battens te laten zien.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546 En we kunnen een functie bouwen die het kanaal of de televisie aanbiedt
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161 So, little picture of a...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219 Uh, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824 Just put the on off button over here in this corner.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571 Bijna alle afstandsbedieningen gebruiken een afstandsbediening op die plek.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271 zodat mensen de knop herkennen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416 So.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043 Een display, of eh, een kleine display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312 You can put it on top of
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615 So most
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199 De meeste mensen kijken vaak naar de spelen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041 A special battle for shifting up and down a channel
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585 Om te lezen waar de dame of de...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038 Dus je kunt gemakkelijk omhoog of omlaag schakelen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404 這...快這...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077560_0077623 any place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316 En andere functies voor de subtitelen, 1-bit voor geluid
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304 En het overige ontwerp, daar moeten we over praten, de vorm van het.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573 And that's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0103973_0104066 What's the function?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374 Ja, om de batterijen op te laden.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104502_0104541 Леб!
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864 Maar ik denk dat ik niet veel energie gebruik
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811 Het is een klein display, dus ik denk dat het op één batterij zal dragen voor 6 maanden of meer.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293 So I believe one battery is just enough.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0107293_0107332 So...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0109111_0109182 Nice
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0122010_0123074 Maar het is een beetje een groot lcd display of een klein lcd display die we willen gebruiken
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359 all that. I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497 Is het mogelijk om een veranderingsgevens te maken?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140497_0141783 Dus je kan met mobiele telefoons, zoals de Nokia, als je de kast kan veranderen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143 Mungkin itu kemungkinan
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0142143_0143382 Je hebt dus alleen nog 1 standaard remote control en je kunt een paar...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139 Je kunt het gewoon gebruiken, maar het is niet heel fijn.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0162139_0162213 So, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324 For left-handed users.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165576_0165671 Yeah, wait, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715 Het is mogelijk om het programma te laten zien, dus je hebt aan de linkerkant of aan de rechterkant een schakelaar voor het schakelen op en uit.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669 En aan de andere kant, knoppen voor het schakelen van het geluid
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929 Um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0168784_0168851 is a fuse.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0171079_0171166 Yeah, but...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417 Let's see, here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825 Of je moet links...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980 I mean, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0174074_0174165 Hey, you...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0181030_0181088 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486 Just using a thermal paste.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832 Yeah, building on it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195579_0195663 所以在現場
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040 You say this, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430 Oh
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266 You got a good server, yeah?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849 So you want to put this way over here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953 Oh. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945 Now it's... Do you have it upside down?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055 ¡Y eso es todo!
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194 被死的機頭人
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199194_0199283 Peace out.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043 Maybe it's possible to make this side like...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428 Oh.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425 to make this side
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850 Black Cod.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217 a bit like so in the form of your hand
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202217_0202304 So...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202446_0202545 That's funny.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157 So the remote control I have to lay in your hands.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536 So it's possible.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151 and the buttons for
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620 Changing the channel over here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644 So I just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150 about this place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060 What the f... I don't know man.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061 Like on your mobile phone or something.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875 Life means much more.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463 But on off button, still on the top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0002409_0002464 Хорошо.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300 I'll start off with pretty much
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995 Ok, I'm gonna inform you about the trend watching I've done over the past few days.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224 We've done some market research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610 We distributed some more of Keshe questionnaires.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021670_0022728 And besides that, I deployed some trend watchers to Milan and Paris to, well, get all of the news trends.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525 I've consulted some additional trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088 The best design would be...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509 Okay, these are some overall findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960 The most important thing is the fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462 The research indicated that that was by far the most important factor.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239 Innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776 By innovative this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839 About half as important as the innovativeness was easy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0027839_0029193 For our group, we're focusing on the people of 60 to 80 years old. These factors are slightly more equal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830 These are some more group specific findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102 The older people prefer dark colors.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533 They like recognizable shapes and familiar material.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093 Our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633 need material for older people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031633_0032764 This image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that a remote should have.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520 This leads us to some personal preferences.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933 The remote control and the docking station should blend in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226 In the room.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797 So this would mean no eye-catching designs.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557 Just keep it simple and well, the docking station and the small screen would be our main points of interest.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270 because this would be the innovativeness in the remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896 So this would be very important that we at least include these features.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036896_0037901 Well, the TreadWatchers, I consulted, advised that it should be remote control and the docking station should be telephone shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470 So you can imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085 This is pretty much a new shape to older people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958 so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170 So it would be kind of more telephone shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0040266_0041314 Besides that we would advise to bring two editions, one with a wood like color and maybe feel and one with a grey black color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809 We would like for the more exclusive people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998 people with more money
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227 The great black color for well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730 People of Lush, means to me.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203 There would be... all.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043635_0043711 the dress
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370 and how exactly does the kinetic energy work.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100370_0100424 Just...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747 Use it and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706 Well, personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499 And besides that, you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267 And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559 get great popularity for our product.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007 And what's next?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196 Yeah, you could load up batteries, you could insert the... find the lost remote control function in there.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720 That's true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954 I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557 Because in our earlier market research, if you would allow me to, we can have that board. Go ahead.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235 So, it's open.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594 We also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369 if people would pay more for speed recognition in a remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827 But you can see here, our target group would not do that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229 So that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667 I would greatly advise not to do it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175 I think it would be better to insert another product that is meant for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0118321_0118391 younger people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924 Um, well this is, yeah, but this is, here the question was would you prefer it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250 So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970 And on top of that the LCD screen would help in making the remote control easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773 And I think the voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744 Well this was for like an LCD screen like you would have on most advanced mobile phones.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971 So pretty large.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803 Let's control all that. I think the most important factor there is the wooden color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136 So it would actually have to be wood.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0138485_0138558 Wood color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574 you get a great advantage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670 We would have to look carefully into the design though.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517 Because we would have to make one more control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a cover.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798 plastic cover
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153 Yeah, more original one. More standard one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355 Yeah, I don't...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184 I'm trying to telephone but...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094 Well no, I think we should just design one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867 One remote, but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305 So, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151 I heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curve. Yes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312 Could you explain that a little more?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954 And what would single curved and double curved mean?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539 So you can pretty much just pick one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156788_0156823 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967 No, just to lay down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229 the cover of the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889 Bu harbi şaheser.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200 You said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you can...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156 So your thumb would be easily... Well, I think that's a very good point because I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause RSI.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342 So it would be great for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900 I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355 For left-handed users also.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985 Well, look.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721 Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the ease of use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0169396_0170527 But if we would make a changing channels and volume button on both sides, that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940 Because it could be made all symmetrical and stuff.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0171552_0171617 That is true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0183930_0184002 That's true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919 I prefer the corners to be round
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215101_0215191 Kim yalancıdır bilmiyorum.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215435_0215516 I'm young yet.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0227946_0227988 오케이, 끝
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318 Well, this is what me and Richard came up with.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630 The default spot for the on off button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914 The mute button just loaded.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143 Then there's the volume and channel selectors.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651 Simple plus minus button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832 We thought of a help button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459 If you hold it and you press another button, the help goes to the LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006 Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210 A button for teletext.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412 button for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547 and the company logo.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108 So it's a rather simple prototype.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509 And we'll have to see from testing how the users take it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603 Sure, we'll play that anytime.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857 Myślę, że jeśli patrzymy na...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312 most controls that got more buttons than this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651 Well, the on-off button is a necessity.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827 Yeah, drop that one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305 Volume and channel buttons you need you obviously need those
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014 The mute button can be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295 So we could cancel that one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198 I think the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796 No, you don't.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107 without the number buttons I guess.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775 So it's rather basic already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707 Yeah, they're... It's my fault. Yeah, they're on the white water.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038707_0039817 They're supposed to be equal sized, rather, with a little logo on it for the volume, the triangle. Just to recognize you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922 That's just recognition.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860 So for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160 With a different color than the case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326 So they jump out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672 Okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531 That's a big cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589 If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402 De docking station is niet zelfs in deze schematiek.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799 No, it's not even taken into the prize.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439 We could save money on it then.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909 But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432 My mother can't even send an SMS message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716 This is the top of the school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859 No, any other remote?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608 You can just not scroll for half a second.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041 If you want to use an LCD screen you need an advanced chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942 If you click just click on one more button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104845_0104933 再見
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706 That is not right. What if you have to scroll to page 88?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015 888...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125 Anda bisa menunggu 2 bot keluar dari sana
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299 and just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820 If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160 So that would save two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291 if you do the same for the challenge.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0125541_0125614 more obvious
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0127499_0127588 Shall we create a thread?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190 If we leave our builders buttons pressed we can go with the flat case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350 And make it smaller overall.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493 So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button. The screen right under that, then the scroll button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801 you get a much smaller remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131028_0131056 Oh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171 Richard argument with all these changes are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0173211_0173289 The other five.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147 Du, du er den vorek, er du vorek.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014 I think that's a free.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412 I still think it's too fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585 to think flashy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806 Is this, like, after this it'll be done, or...?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0199991_0200038 That's a shame.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434 Yeah, there wasn't enough room for the finance and the rest.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207148_0207215 That just wasn't good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687 The tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step and it's very easy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414 The smartboard, the drawing is just a pain in the ass.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773 The dental plan is very nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110 Flip over for more precise
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0214261_0214361 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0217626_0217690 I'm not gonna work.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023 considering we are not going to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0002698_0002756 Not a problem.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551 It's close to home and it's time to die.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665 Start at 3 o'clock.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450 Our fourth and last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004774_0004870 Oh, there he is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801 Ok, this is our last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236 In this meeting we will discuss our final design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073 and we will do some evaluation about not only the product but also the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473 And then we're going to close the project today as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027 So after this you'll be a free girl and you'll spend all your money.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951 Dit is een detail design meeting waar we het over hebben.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616 the usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053 In order to go to this agenda.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431 We will have the prototype presentation first.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847 Then we will set up some evaluation criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128 Then we will look at the finance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851 We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264 Everything costs money and the more furniture you want to have, the more money it will cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897 So we'll see if it fits within the 12.5 Euro per month.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106 We will see that later.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608 Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797 I've got 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313 So we will be finished at half past three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458 But first,
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059 We will do the prototype presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536 to some aspects of the fort.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033 But I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364 Just a few buttons and large buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914 Maar ik denk dat dit allemaal samen zijn. Behoorlijk weinig knoppen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558 I'm wondering if we really need all of those bathrooms.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0030283_0030338 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008 Long time, yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0034073_0034143 backflip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567 Da sind schon Titles drin.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300 So yeah, it's something about the design of the buttons there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660 Yes, my whole planet is rolled
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042770_0042859 It's not easy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583 then it goes on, we have 30 minutes left I will move on to the finance part
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103 Which is pretty exciting to see if it's at all possible what we're going to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313 And I can tell you...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184 But we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12,5 euros.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093 If we see... I don't know if I filled in correctly, so just correct me if you see something wrong.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275 I counted two batteries.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449 Peut-être que les hulls commencent à y jouer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571 I don't know if that's also pretty true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046688_0046778 It's vitriolic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046778_0046829 Okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569 Let's turn your roads off. OK.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771 Asansörü kullanmalıyız.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964 자리에 앉아주세요
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445 Save there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674 Here we have the single curves.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330 We kunnen zien dat de verschil tussen ongekeerde en een enkele keer is 1 euro.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0049567_0050630 Ik weet het niet, maar ik denk dat de enige curve goed is voor het ontwerp en ook voor het display om een prominente plaats te hebben op de remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771 I think we have to keep it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207 Then we have the case material supplements.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051207_0051288 It's plastic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551 It's the cheapest one we need.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892 So that's not much to save either.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253 But then the biggest cause are the buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124 Dus misschien moeten we echt proberen om wat knoppen af te schuilen om onze kosten te houden.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846 Because we would have to... We would have to get the 12,5 euros at the end.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498 So, let's first count the buttons we have now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741 16
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171 Now it's all getting wetter.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282 Nathan's a real ass.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363 Okay, including the help.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577 I'm sad.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973 I think we can discard the help and the mute button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577 by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157 It's safe since the bugger out already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347 We staan hier op koud 14.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729 Não é... Brasil?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058911_0059003 And this is...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638 那都是我
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761 Yeah, but it's not stated in this. It's just a...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582 So maybe you can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189 beh se fosse per lì ciò...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747 And it's good for the design as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063747_0063844 I'll see you again maybe.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253 Uhhhh, let's see...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373 I can make this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283 It's good right there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604 crawled.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938 It's cheaper, so, uh...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067938_0067994 Yeah, it was terrible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755 I think they can do the interior of the car.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434 Ah, on the tip there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069640_0069710 RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069710_0069759 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476 But I think because we have the advanced chip, we can just count this as one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612 Yeah, I'll do that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110 Maybe he hates me. Then it seems to me that it's impossible to get a 12.5 euro.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807 Also the LC display. I think it's too expensive for the display we use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166 I think they tried
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535 That's right, but what's the big advantage of a remote then?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858 Taken into the prize.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075858_0075946 Fatiha.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075946_0075992 It's rare.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577 That's an option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108 어이C...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625 Don't you think we can... if we can count this as one button?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335 and integrate these platforms in three. Then it saves a lot of money as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0079648_0079729 Это чё?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216 Yeah, but we have to stick with the 12 and all of you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758 We don't have any more budget. The margin of the total.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085451_0085521 cuz
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913 If you figure out that I'm a realist, play.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188 And if you use less buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824 I can't use the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445 There it is. Yeah. True.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876 And then, so...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0088391_0088466 Keep it moving.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850 I think it's difficult as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606 Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programming.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091774_0091815 R.I.P.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155 Because that's not... We saved 10 buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797 Holy shit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082 I'm going to wait for the escorts.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454 눈물 나
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956 But maybe you can...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416 Scroll
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856 If you scroll you will see the numbers on the LCD display.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061 until you've got the right number, then you push it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800 And scroll down, push button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289 Okay, but then you can push some other person too.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097773_0097811 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288 You scroll to a number and then you wait a half second and then it comes to the channel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412 Yeah, we definitely broadcast.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634 And... we better...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440 And the regular chip is not possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541 It has to be at first.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028 You need an advanced chip, yeah?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674 Now you can save a euro by a flip design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510 That's an option we can do. Then we're almost there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103221_0103313 So if we
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097 Yeah, but I think that is a big advantage.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780 Can we integrate the data text and the subtitles in one button?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181 I think it's pretty much done.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0110185_0111458 I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738 Just make it real simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275 Because it saves, it saves a lot of money.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622 And we can keep our LCD screen which can provide extra information.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798 how to use the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097 I think it's the Auditor Vigilance S subtitles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870 And it's good for the innovative design as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054 I'm here with you guys.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455 Okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936 I am the best
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970 I think she went off maybe.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0118202_0118283 Nice
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389 Something like that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627 And yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119627_0119725 I've got this far now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, let's see if we can erase this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659 Um beijo para você, Sô.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704 That's really a good idea, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742 And that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440 so we make one volume for the channel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540 Let's scroll.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127540_0127616 It's worth it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873 So we've got 1, 2, 3...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246 Yeah, we can leave the teletext in if we want.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484 Das ist ein schönes Zettel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0129528_0129580 So if you...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130183_0130236 Nie więc...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130848_0130903 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131141_0131200 It's pretty good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599 Decrease the slow to more weapons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0132777_0132865 There you go, only after.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891 It's more the laws in which they are being made I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149 Single currents is pretty easy to just fill in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440 And then the case has gone right out of the machine.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932 I think the good thing is that it's a different machine than the flat one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349 I think this is a really easy one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204 What does everybody think about a flap or a single curved design?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368 Ouais, y'a de l'eau.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976 Yes, it does cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138075_0138134 Yeah, I'm glad.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138448_0138544 Get us
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061 I'm going to do some more research.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867 But I think we can keep the single curve.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423 Just to express our LCD screen a bit more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234 Some people will use it more, especially for the health functions. It will be good if we have scrollbar, scrollbutton.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583 It will be necessary if we have a good cloud function as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553 I found a scroll.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030 I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412 Yes, definitely.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852 I'm glad you could make it this far.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487 It's pretty different. It's pretty different.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0146301_0146358 Together
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692 Yeah, I'm sorry.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147824_0147921 Thank you most.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713 changing a gen or so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057 We can maybe, it's a... We can stick it out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480 Like an old book.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709 Maybe it is recognizable for them as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882 It's a good book.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380 So I'm afraid we have to move on.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789 It's less frightening I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461 If they're serious designing it, they're only five buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0151710_0151804 It'd be like what?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752 I would buy it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182 I would buy the event on Sydney.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385 I don't know
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583 Articus and the Fountain of Heroes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939 Uh, yes they are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590 then we can go on with the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070 Grazie.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185 Okay, sit down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519 We still have 15 minutes left so be nice and schedule.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017 The project process
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654 Evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0156703 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972 That was the thingy, the point, I forgot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157073_0157148 Shit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416 Very well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406 We've got five minutes I think. We can just go to TV.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595 No, we've got 15 minutes but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0159654_0159733 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0160899_0160939 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947 Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409 أحاول ذلك ولكنه يؤثر على الوصول إلى الصفحة.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151 I think it's fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912 subtitles, and the things.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763 So we've got 20 cents for our docking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172007_0172054 questo è il nostro lavoro
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577 There is a bit dodgy here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279 I would say four out of five.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431 405-4
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173431_0173528 be thankful.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0174139_0174236 as it's finishing up.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410 I think it's a 7.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373 Ice balls.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514 I haven't worked out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276 They are ugly, not very functional and getting lost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496 I think with a new radio button, I think it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180601_0180679 I think it's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0181167_0181228 天啊
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495 That we give this for?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543 Then we have to do it in three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656 Let's go.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737 Yeah, leave the love in there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657 and they want to put fashion in their products.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820 in the slogan of the company.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250 We hebben de vervangbare voorkaten.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526 So I think it's very recognizable.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302 We've gotta go, Mia.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159 We've got to go and tell you what it is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159 29
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0191694_0191750 What do you want?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723 Bu arada eğrik bir şey.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192723_0192769 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734 That's 84%
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531 I think it's a pretty nice score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196264_0196309 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091 That brings us to the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969 project process
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284 Did we move through the right phases, you think?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0198284_0198384 long roses
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199215_0199260 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792 So lack of information about prices.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462 What's the room for creativity?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171 Because of the finance sheet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519 The rumors...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092 Internet access.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292 Was it clear what everybody had to do? According to their roles and functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819 Did it work out?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206819_0206916 Working together.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281 Also, you, to review with the... Yeah, it was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665 were the means sufficient for the tasks that we had to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854 or are we doing too much?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210536_0210617 Smilingly.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227 if it wants to download this data.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719 Smartboard was irritating.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663 So you rather want it to have a flip over?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862 or something like that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403 Faster as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214952_0215006 Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117 You need a smart board application I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463 But I think...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606 That should be close enough.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760 Yeah, you can export this image.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036 Yeah, I missed Asia.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673 So the sharing of information was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141 Ja, ik ben niet zo gaande tegen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0221553_0221616 it's possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383 We found new ideas for
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719 I think this kind of meeting is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853 So everybody puts his own score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438 Yeah, and it mediates the score and you can get one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629 That's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773 Sorry, it's, uh...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226902_0226980 I hate gold.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875 Any more ideas?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035 or questions about the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187 or about the product.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027 Because I think...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842 Now that we get to our last ship
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225 Articles in the budget
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759 considering we are not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184 Dirty station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323 謝謝
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942 But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459 And I think you can compensate that as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053 So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536 Do we think we're gonna get the 12.5 million?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728 How old was it? 15.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002 Pressing good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226 I think we will.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421 We're gonna export this product.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631 Ja, in de overtijd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796 Christian America.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996 People are pretty ticked in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923 And even more for the younger people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789 Just put it on the market for everybody.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421 You can change markets by changing the front cover.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648 That's one thing you can change it up.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492 So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the mark.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596 Just as a test.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780 See ya, Whip-Wraps.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960 That's I think a good thing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889 I think we can have our little celebration right now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243008_0243104 Party punk.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641 I think we still have to put in more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243641_0243727 I see.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243727_0243778 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907 I didn't get the message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644 From the ending of the Ablique...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766 5 more minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244766_0244857 Oh, okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441 Then we still have some questions.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777 Somebody has some questions they can ask now?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188 We can put this in the project folder as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0246188_0246256 Hmm?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137 Next one is... picture I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996 This is another good thing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380 So is he a pressure controller?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0251380_0251450 太亂了
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252084_0252182 Alright.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073 I think I'm going to make our final presentation now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994 And then I'll be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292 summary of the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455 I think you will get the Christian in your room.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867 And then I'll meet you in... I think like... 10 minutes. Alright, okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257911_0257969 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676 Hopefully my pen will download its software.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258798_0258869 Birdcage
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520 Dat zijn gewoon de normale remote controles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092 You push it, you come in page 100
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492 Je kunt de normale 1-0 knoppen gebruiken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251 Je kunt ook de knop van de kanaal veranderen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597 So the shifting better, okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145 for shifting up in the text and shifting down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0028020_0028081 Interesting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0032664_0032723 certain gusts.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076 Of je kunt het bouwen als je één knop drukt.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258 weapon yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430 We just discussed that already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841 Maar we denken dat alle mensen die die optie niet kennen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336 So they just put it in the press for the bed on it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0036106_0036142 huh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0038595_0038650 Je t'entends.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039621_0039712 Try it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870 Just to recognize it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252 And we don't need a LED or a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216 Sommige remote controles hebben dat, maar omdat we het kleine display gebruiken, moeten we het niet gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353 Yeah, so...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989 да, конечно, есть
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640 God, there is no other answer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055647_0055737 17
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074 Yeah, with the help of...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059797_0059890 I think there are two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170 Well, it's just one battle.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336 bit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809 To fire one big bomb
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278 But they are more expensive than the small ones.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447 I
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922 Just a reference.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814 But I don't know if it's cheaper.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508 So, we still got four buttons, but just...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393 Je kan, eh, niet op de bedden zelf, maar eh... Op de, eh... Op de chipkast.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825 The chip you got for a button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0070187_0070270 Yeah, but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323 We kunnen een remote control gebruiken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080323_0080403 So, um...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080795_0081905 Hij moet eh... Hij moet eh... Hij moet eh... Bijna eh... Bijna eh... 12 eh... 1250 of... Ja ja. Kan het eh...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675 This is a tool.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308 Het is mogelijk om er een voor 1250 te maken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0085405_0085486 I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769 But I can't use a sword.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698 that we want to make a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326 Zo fancy en goed, ja
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709 Wait, wait not there, wait there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083 attractieve opties
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571 Dus u kunt hieronder blijven, tot 12.50 uur.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862 Screw this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091964_0092017 Nah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0102171_0102209 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643 Of we moeten de ondertitelsknop uitkijken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896 I think that's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203 Yeah, it's a big country.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445 But, uh... Can we just...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104854_0104924 再見
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420 Maar als je dat doet, dan is het een beetje te veel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106593_0106649 to stay changed.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180 One, but a few...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0130811_0130845 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737 Maar je kunt een behoorlijk groot 3D-matig controle voor precies dezelfde prijs als een klein model.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154 Je moet alleen betalen voor de dubbel of de enige curve
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0144166_0144215 뭐야
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881 Oh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245 Maar ze weten de scrollknoppen van oude radio's.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690 And there you go, also buttons like that for changing channels.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848 Dus we kunnen misschien...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341 That's very special, so...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0169428_0169515 Söyle.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172293_0172354 There it is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113 Oh, people would say.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379 405.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0174813_0174866 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045 There's that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054 That's a free music.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961 We have to test it a little bit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151 Yeah, true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0183216_0183313 and go for a train.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0184600_0184659 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0198655_0198706 T'es cuisson
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034 After Bruce Lee, we saw
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998 Maar als je wilt delen als je een foto maakt zoals deze op een presentatie
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302 It's easier to share it with other people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688 Dus je kunt het opzetten en op de internet instellen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321 or in shared folder or shared directory.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617 on my laptop but no
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571 Can you export it like a... Should be possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221557_0221619 It's possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0222830_0223899 Yeah, maybe, let me just give the numbers of
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0224017_0225098 Het is makkelijker om dingen op de computer te doen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564 Just like a university
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0232341_0232375 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0243410_0243496 Esse tipo de coisa aí...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498 Abonnez-vous à...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875 Maybe they will save it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252875_0252954 so yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986 Maybe we have to fill another equation in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256986_0257044 I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471 That's the way.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765 Sorry I'm a little late. Not a problem.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891 Got stuck in the traffic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337 Is this the moment where we can ask questions about the functionality?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526 When you are in Teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you go to the next Teletext page.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009 I think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127 That's what I pointed out earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580 If you just make a control for just the TV, there's just not much to gain here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624 Sounds pretty charmer, man.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604 Good morning.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058664_0058737 O que é isso?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435 I assume you count the volume and channel things for two buttons each, right?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016 I think I did it with two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891 I was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402 Don't cut the cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849 I think this really is for buttons, ain't ya?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689 only the docking station I guess
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247 Maybe she came to the different spot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213 Ia, da-ti un anumit. Mai moare ca...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340 Well, since the market research
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439 indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy. Maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715 Especially since we have those nice features.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761 If you could figure out the MCN news play?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089659_0089691 Oh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089831_0090913 Basically you can only choose between either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017 But how would a scroll wheel work here?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447 That would bring up the price of the school in some cases.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836 I
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096836_0096923 But then you...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523 I think that would be like the end of reusability.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0099189_0099267 謝謝 再見
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892 I think it's pretty much, teletext subtitles are, right now you just push the teletext button, go to page 888, and the teletext disappears.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058 but sometimes I'll stay there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387 Dus de tweede keer is hem met ons gewijzigd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498 I could be... scroll to the 8, click, scroll to the 8, click, scroll to the 8, click.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376 But then again, that would be just a pretty much normal option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108535_0108604 Holding it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349 a remote which they expect to have like 10 buttons for the numbers 1 to 0
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761 With only 5 buttons on it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109976_0110054 That's cool dude.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143 It's a pretty big skull isn't it?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621 So this is fun.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884 Right now we...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803 Well, I still think we should go for the single curve design now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008 Let me get...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451 All these changes are not really okay with me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601 but since
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137769_0137865 I just have to...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255 I'd rather just go to the board and...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782 Get us $18 a remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228 We'll do some more research and see what the options are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362 It's pretty little thing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959 This is not really like for the group you were making.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152 This will really require a lot of marketing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482 to get this to sell.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297 Older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426 This is not familiar content.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830 So we're gonna have to do a lot of convincing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151389_0151436 Je fais ça.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580 It might be confusing too.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151720_0151805 They'd be like, what?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906 Only five buttons?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944 But you're not 60.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394 So I like set up all these criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642 evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339 Fuckin' with this?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865 Okay, so I did some literature study, analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347 translated into criteria, which would be these.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584 This is Remote Fantasy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756 Deze is een beetje een scherpe schilderij.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137 What new functions are there?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162137_0162232 Easy to use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741 learnability is a very important factor here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952 It's functional
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317 There are not too many functions and the amount of functions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740 And those functions, are they useful?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163740_0163825 And the cost?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164080_0164162 The target group
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617 This is the remote wheelie for the group we are making it for.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998 and wake up mobility
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536 If our company is easily recognizable, then our company made it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081 So we're supposed to evaluate it right now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166423_0166471 Slip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260 Oh, I have to say, this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0167371_0167425 We're not here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001 SCB's are in fancy on a scale of 1 to 7.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635 There we go, that's six.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392 This is the design I'm over to.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929 Okay, so if I LCDs, the elevation, and the gold buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030 Should we do one? Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181 It's the design easy to use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172780_0172879 would be for us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0173579_0173666 I'd go for four or three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438 This is a design functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714 Do we have all functions that we want to include?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174849_0174943 You think we do?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151 Do we have too many functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175151_0175235 Bu da antik şey.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175235_0175320 pretty slick
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990 Oh, and Dewey.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676 take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833 like it getting lost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301 There's a rat in front of everyone. Nice balls.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0177301_0177351 Maybe.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770 Production costs would increase a dent
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178770_0178849 You wanna leave right now?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698 This is the sign that fit the group with focus.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180138_0180230 I think with the new...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180815_0180879 It's tense.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181091_0181152 땡!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034 I think the radio button is not exactly what older people expect of a remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0182989_0183036 I'm not sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172 I think I'd go for a tea.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632 Is it completely recognisable? Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139 Die!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762 I was also supposed to calculate the score but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353 We have another present. We've got a camera.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785 Is this like a traditional return?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100 Alright, we got it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189254_0189335 Why, huh?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567 These are our sub-effectors down the side of this room.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356 Поехали на второй.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964 I'm just going to...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191089_0191157 transform
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499 Or maybe minus 8.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834 41
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134 Guess we'll just type it in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171 So I can be a clown.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145 I think we should have had the finance thingy with Altair there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442 In the design phase.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0201763_0201840 Not too much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202278_0202335 Yeah, true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157 and I would have liked to go for that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420 younger users also.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833 and just be able to access the internet again.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0204002_0204098 Get something of your own.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573 I tried to open the file on my laptop but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217671_0217762 Not possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219000_0219096 You should have done nothing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219812_0219863 That was me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0232490_0232532 They are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767 15.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237264_0237626 Yeah, I still don't think... I mean if we're gonna make a scroll button anyway.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244 Maybe more for the younger people than for the older people. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405 So maybe we should just refocus?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004 Specifically for younger people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0239502_0239563 Asturies.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758 I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is with older people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0241921_0241996 all the people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325 even if it were their covers.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121 Party, party.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0244479_0244521 Yeah, you do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0253017_0253106 سنبدأ بالمدد
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515 I know you're supposed to make it. And then I'll be back.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688 Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0259069_0259156 Nothing guys.
