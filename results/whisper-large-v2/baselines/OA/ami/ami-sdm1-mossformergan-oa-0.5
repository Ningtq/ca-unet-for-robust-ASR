AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0001232_0001522 So, show me what you need to talk about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003404_0003804 There you go.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003804_0004372 Oh my god, mine as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0004372_0004550 This wasn't a good start.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0014258_0014411 So that you can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0015240_0015280 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0019299_0019342 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0020774_0021798 I guess a button makes a bit more sense, because otherwise you don't really know that, oh, what if I right-click now? What happens then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0021798_0022021 Well no, you still have the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0022494_0022568 It's morning.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0023119_0023309 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0028511_0029029 I mean, it's more like part of the.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029176_0029382 Trousing sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029382_0029782 more than the speaker characterization as Steve mentioned.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029782_0030242 Yeah, it's true. Yeah, it's nice to have it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033387_0033423 I
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033648_0034102 I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034102_0034749 well if you get the correctation that someone talks a lot in a certain topic
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034749_0035495 and then if you click on that topic you get everything that's in that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035495_0035633 That's still another...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035885_0035950 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0047186_0047257 Like we have to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048370_0048684 like shoulder speaker characteristics
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048684_0048784 I'm turning this off.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0049626_0050203 But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0050347_0050518 Bu ne?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0052255_0052654 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0053716_0053759 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054234_0054469 I'm guessing it depends on the...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054629_0054823 Yeah, but you're a good, you know?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0056192_0056252 single channel.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0064834_0065636 But, well, currently, I mean, you probably, I don't know if you want to have, like, the full transcription and the summary at the same time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0065756_0066343 So maybe you could just choose the same window for transcription and summary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066792_0066942 Catch some guys.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066942_0067089 Das ist ein sehr lustiger.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067488_0067598 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067598_0067821 I can't do that. I can't do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069530_0069723 Or just, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069723_0070329 Yeah, that might be changed to contents of the same window. Yeah. From transcription to summary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0070453_0070496 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071598_0071661 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071661_0071729 They can do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071903_0072556 No, no, it could be like transcription.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0073967_0074082 Примите курицу.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0075387_0075484 Maybe, I thought I was supposed to be...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0077778_0077821 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079078_0079370 Yeah, well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079370_0079997 But transcripts, sounds reasonable to have like transcripts, like maybe three alternatives then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079997_0080387 like full meeting, meeting without disabilities and summaries.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0081037_0081143 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084663_0084719 okey, selam
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084719_0085603 I mean just to try and I mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing. Yeah that's what we need.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086073_0086473 Just so see the integration works.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086888_0087101 So I guess that's what we need to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088004_0088628 Well, I guess, I mean, that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088628_0088867 Yeah, I guess.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0094981_0095082 Let's do it again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0097561_0097613 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099449_0099697 I can tell you what I'm in a SP2
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099998_0100130 Oh, um, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0100130_0101160 I started browsing a bit, just trying to see if there's anything out there to use.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101288_0101585 Yeah, it's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101585_0101685 Great files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101685_0101792 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101792_0102458 I found a tutorial that inverted search indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103281_0103473 Yeah, well, I don't know if it's usable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103473_0103608 I haven't looked at it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103608_0104072 But I found some code from a tutorial about indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104072_0104133 Oh great.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104458_0104529 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0105467_0105681 So you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106017_0106053 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106053_0106854 I was a bit worried about when he talked about this with the file.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106854_0107249 I mean, how much do we actually need to do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0107249_0107771 like extracting things from the XML files and stuff to be able to do the indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110119_0110483 Are you running each other? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110616_0110841 I mean you should look at... have a look at...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0113394_0114347 Yeah, I guess, I mean, it was a good point you had, that like collaborating with Fowl
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0114347_0114848 I mean if you already started on that stuff, I guess we can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115519_0115636 Should we?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115829_0115980 meet up and see what we could do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115980_0116747 I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need. What we know more of what we need maybe.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0116747_0116842 week
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0121416_0121534 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0122521_0122604 Where else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128171_0128615 But what is it like a window where you have to write a search query?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128615_0128800 or is it just what's behind it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128800_0129035 No, this is not the actual
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0129035_0129151 such.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0134560_0135831 What do you, like, is there a open thingy or... What did you do to, like, how did you figure out that this uses mixed-use search? Is it...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144448_0144493 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144867_0144899 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0149397_0149437 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0152324_0152410 Witch.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0155807_0156044 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0156411_0156771 I'll be happy when this course is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0157437_0157493 Thank you very much.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0159344_0159439 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0163914_0163954 I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166080_0166148 booze
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166778_0167381 The progress report is June 23rd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0167730_0167888 Um...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0169920_0170266 Just looking at my own deadlines.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0170294_0170594 I'm
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0172494_0172917 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0172917_0173184 Oh, that's that's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0173910_0174620 It's actually all these things that are mixed together.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175509_0175587 Boom.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175691_0175770 I know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175770_0175999 That's just us.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175999_0176266 Maybe you should make it exist then!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0179871_0180527 It would be nice to meet up and you can sort of show us a bit, you know, already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0180527_0180987 so we don't have to do all the work again, just figuring out stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0181391_0181684 Just like accessing the corpus and stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0185851_0185928 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0186513_0186630 Um, no.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0187051_0187192 Yeah, this one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0188834_0188902 It's full.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0190341_0190431 Herzlichen Dank.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0190431_0190658 This is her
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0191051_0191105 front door.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0191630_0191708 this computer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0192242_0192775 Our letters are all in there. We can look now afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193805_0193935 Into what? The computer room.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193935_0194028 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0195765_0196060 We could photocopy your assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0196589_0196765 So what time do we say?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197137_0197220 Yeah, that's how it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197331_0197709 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199088_0199348 Maybe it doesn't have to be that way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199474_0199554 Sounds like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199554_0199647 It's really weird.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199647_0200193 It should be. Is it really? Well, it's supposed to be. Next week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200193_0200308 It's week six next week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200554_0200596 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200596_0201020 We have one class of these, one year. That's beautiful.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201020_0201252 but I think we're having like, oh well, the classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201252_0201545 I don't think they were
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202017_0202078 Keep warm.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202348_0202617 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202617_0203004 I think the undergraduates had more of the...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204224_0204578 Yeah, we will probably.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204578_0204860 Okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205048_0205523 Yeah. I guess that's it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205523_0205676 Was there anything else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205676_0206048 Do you want to move? Why not? Like, take care of this one. Should I take care of it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206263_0206578 I don't know if there was something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206578_0206731 I think it basically said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206959_0207489 the same things as in the comments, if I could use it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0207601_0208075 I'll be back.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0208880_0209062 We'll see.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0209487_0209690 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210783_0210862 I'm gonna go watch some...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210996_0211532 And now we have 7% of the person. Good?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211532_0211708 That's pretty good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211708_0211786 I think you need to...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211914_0212391 if you're okay with having it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213391_0213503 We're done now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213503_0213747 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213928_0214081 Is she still here?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0214081_0214159 Kiss you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0000358_0000538 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001320_0001372 şöyle
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001521_0002417 Should we just go around and everyone says what they've been doing? Has anybody done anything? No one has.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0002417_0002522 Why?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003057_0003385 Well I've got a browser now, which... whoops.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003385_0003440 All right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005038_0005142 So yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005142_0005935 We've got a browser which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005935_0006681 And then when you go on the menu you can select a summarisation box which pops up and an audio player.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0006879_0007304 Rwy'n credu bod y cyfrifiad yn gweithio hefyd, felly gallwch chi ddod i mewn i'r cyfrifiad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007304_0007975 and it loads up just the background windows are empty and so when you start
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007975_0008475 Mae angen i chi ei ddysgu, dysgu unrhyw adnodd arbenigol neu wneud ymchwil a'i ddysgu trwy hynny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008648_0008707 That make sense?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008861_0009603 The transcription box has got a summarize button which doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0009603_0010391 Now I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up window with the speaker characterization.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010620_0010958 Either we could do that, you know, when does a pop-up come up?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010958_0011582 Either we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box,
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0011582_0012313 Or we can put an extra button, extra few buttons next to the summarize button so that you are actually in the transcription box.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012838 Felly, rydw i'n clicio ar y botwm ac yna'r yrpsyn yn ysgrifennu'r sgrifennu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012838_0013481 The problem is the left click is already used because it highlights that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0013662_0014263 y rhan o'r sgwrs neu beth bynnag mae hynny'n ei wneud. Mae'r click llawer. Mae'r click lawr yn ei gynhyrchu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014263_0014755 I don't know what happened to the one you did look like actually.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014755_0015291 But that would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015291_0015579 I think so yeah when you left click it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015579_0016074 gallwch, er enghraifft, setio'r marcer yno fel y bydd y sain yn mynd o'rno, rwy'n credu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016268_0016434 So we can't put it on lefty
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016434_0016638 We could put it on a right click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016638_0016875 We could, for example, have a little menu that pops up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0017064_0017669 So right click on it and you can click on speaker characterisation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018003_0018170 That's a good point.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018170_0018296 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018296_0018364 Otherwise...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018512_0019136 Yeah, yeah, but I don't know about you, but usually in Windows, right-click doesn't do anything, does it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019136_0019281 It opens a menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019281_0019509 iawn
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019509_0019685 So yeah, please.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019685_0019789 I'm gonna get all stuffed with that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0020464_0020661 Or just, you know, or just the button.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0021828_0022161 Well no, you still have the menu pop up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022303_0022415 Well, oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022415_0022683 It's more obvious isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022781_0022916 Yeah, that's sad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022916_0023124 That's true, yeah. It's more in Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0023440_0023676 It's not even worse than your head pains.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0024560_0025014 I'm good. This one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0025014_0026007 But actually what we could do is in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026135_0026438 I'd like a search for that user.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026438_0026635 Is that going to be useful or too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0027270_0027918 Yeah, so when you right click on it, one option will be give me all your meetings, characterise the speaker.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0028408_0028527 Or is that too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0029777_0029908 Yeah, it's trivial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030101_0030163 Yeah, it's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030163_0030404 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031661_0031855 What do you mean by that? The speaker characterization.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031855_0031976 Oh well, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032138_0032239 I didn't know about that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032239_0032507 I mean, the speaker characterization is a bit like he said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032507_0032731 I mean, it's like a nice thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032731_0033237 We don't, we're not actually sure what the user wants with it but it's interesting so why not give it to him?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033408_0033513 I think we should do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033513_0033555 MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035475_0035713 Iawn, mae'n dal i fod yn nifer arall.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035713_0035849 I mean, we're not even there yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035849_0036132 Does that even pop up as a characterisation?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036132_0036419 We have to first define what happens when you click on a user.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036933_0037201 So should we try to do a right peg when you then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0038786_0039120 yeah there's a second thing about the topics the topic window
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039120_0039859 You want to somehow be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039955_0040278 Felly gallwn ei wneud yn ffodus iach.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040278_0040500 So this is for...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040963_0041128 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0041128_0042077 So we have basically two options of browsing the meetings, either searching and opening individual observations
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0042077_0042413 and then we have the interlinking by right click basically.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0043540_0043601 Double click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0046279_0046699 Dydw i ddim yn gweld unrhyw beth yn amlwg a fyddai'n gallu...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0048635_0049016 Yeah, but then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0049016_0049385 and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050231_0050320 Yeah, we're good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050661_0051319 It's not the end of the world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051319_0051763 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051763_0052198 I'll check what it does on double click at the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052198_0052354 because I think it might do something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052354_0053059 I really don't see anything obvious there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0053232_0053373 I mean, if you can think of something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0054942_0055367 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055367_0055554 Single audio files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055554_0055657 Do you want to use them?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056175_0056388 Yeah, single channel files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056388_0056482 So we want them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056482_0056539 I mean.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056935_0057083 Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0057083_0057836 Felly, ydych chi'n meddwl, efallai y byddwn ni'n defnyddio nhw i weithio gyda nhw, ond a ydych chi eisiau eu cyflawni i mewn i'r brofiad?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058138_0058175 Do you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058175_0058529 He's not going to make much sense if you listen to it on its own, do you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058529_0058566 less.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0059290_0059432 I know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061004_0061410 Yeah, well what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that you've mentioned?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061410_0061622 Do you think we call it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061802_0062025 That's why.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0062025_0062566 I mean I'm very much, I want to have everything customisable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063100_0063186 Probably not, no.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063271_0063546 Choose me, baby. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063546_0063967 But yeah, it depends. I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063967_0064139 And the summary, for example, is typical.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064139_0064653 you open the window, you read through it, you might close it again straight away.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064653_0064783 I think it's...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0066465_0066707 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067015_0067093 I'm gonna send this to Tom.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067093_0067298 Yeah!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067298_0067356 That's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067356_0067509 Я ношу у меня...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067774_0067816 I just.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067816_0068028 Maybe, he probably can.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068028_0068145 I'm sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068145_0068259 I'm sure you can do anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069193_0069280 I can have a look.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069694_0069876 But yeah, that might be changed to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074042_0074793 Mae'n rhaid i bobl ddeall, pan ddefnyddwch defnyddio'r ffenestri, mae llawer o'r ffenestri yn agos.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074793_0074870 City Manager.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075637_0075770 Yeah, you can anyways.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075770_0075825 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0076972_0077180 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077312_0077525 Yeah, they're definitely going to be in the same one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077961_0078225 Ie, dyna oedd y cynllun ar gyfer y dysfrifiadurau.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078225_0078273 So
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078405_0078674 Yeah, do you want to do that with some reason?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078674_0078914 put the summaries in the same way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0079024_0079145 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0080411_0080636 Yeah. Do you remember that? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0081658_0082025 and finally the prototype he spoke about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082025_0082238 What kind of prototype could we produce?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082427_0082876 Because I'm just, you know, I go into the lab and I say, what am I going to change today?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082876_0082966 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082966_0083521 And it kind of just, it just develops. I'm not aiming for anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0083521_0083648 Do we want to aim for something?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084151_0084417 I'm pretty much getting there anyway, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084417_0084676 It's not going to be a lot more work.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0086512_0086575 I'm gonna check.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0087635_0087724 No, that's not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090041_0090334 Like if we're gonna just try and take a look or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090334_0090526 I don't know if your answer is for people's...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091245_0091452 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091452_0091735 I don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can show it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092632_0092884 Alright, well I'll make that readable then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092884_0093251 So the directory is my number.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093469_0093781 Well, this is not difficult. What's your number?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093781_0093953 In all the emails.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093953_0094325 Not awful
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094325_0094677 04525
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094852_0094906 sick time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095076_0095254 845556...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095493_0095832 And then there's a full doc in LSSD.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095954_0096182 And it's called the M Browser.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0096372_0096633 Yes, but I am from Italy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097137_0097408 No, I'm extremely organized.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097408_0097519 I've got a call this afternoon.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097519_0097586 Now the fold.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098653_0098772 Yeah, so that's me doing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098772_0098929 Someone else mind talking about their stuff?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101141_0101294 What were you doing again?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101518_0101603 I'm so sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103010_0103097 Alright.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103097_0103239 Found some pie
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103796_0103892 from a tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0104071_0104139 Oh, great.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105314_0105391 Yeah, that's handy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105647_0105801 So you think it shouldn't be too difficult?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107796_0107929 I always need.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107984_0108254 I'm going to have to convert it to some sort of format.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0110673_0111508 Yn ystod y brifysgrif, mae'r cyfrifiadau wedi'u llysu, er enghraifft, yn ysgrifennu trafodaethau.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0111508_0111638 I'm sure they do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117526_0117565 What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117565_0117771 This is only two days old.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119772_0119940 That was complete rubbish.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119940_0120083 It wasn't when it was.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0120083_0120184 I'm so excited.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122509_0122961 Well, the browser is I use it now or as...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122961_0124017 Roedd yna pan ddechreuais yn ei ddweud. Mae'n defnyddio'r search NXT i ddod o'r ddata o'r ffaithau.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124017_0124283 Which I think is odd, but I'm not quite sure how it works yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124283_0124371 and other cornerstone.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124736_0125544 To get the data, for example to get the summarisation data, you have to search for the IDs on something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0126372_0126907 So they don't say look in that folder, they say search everything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127599_0127915 It does load up quite quickly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127915_0128090 It's not too bad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128090_0128300 But what is it like?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128916_0129092 No, this is not the actual search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129092_0129792 This is just when you open, you know, to load the transcript for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129792_0130668 it does search for the string transcript or text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0131325_0132073 Yeah, so I don't know if you've looked at the search query language but it's like a $A text.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132517_0132635 And then, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132635_0133008 because every year all of these
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133146_0133367 Mae'r ffail hwn yn cael un o'r cyfleoedd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133367_0133778 and all the transcript files got the string. I don't know what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133778_0134161 words or text or something in it. So just search for those files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0135749_0136115 How long is it? Well, it's in the code.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136115_0136646 just that you define a search object and then you search that string.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136646_0136971 how to figure out how to do the same thing with someone.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136971_0137045 That's the way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137199_0137656 I had to understand how they did the transcript to do the song.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137932_0138302 Yeah, just search for specific strings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0138539_0139209 So you could just, you know, you could use that when you, if you want to take the data out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0139668_0140326 if you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140326_0140557 you know, whatever you want to do, then just send me an email.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140684_0140767 I can explain.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141071_0141221 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141221_0141861 actually in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the browser that i used from this phone you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141861_0142167 that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142167_0142569 dwi ddim yn ddweud bod y ham yn dweud
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142569_0142648 Yeah, just the same.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142891_0143171 So they're all in there, yeah. Still.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143171_0143597 A lot of rubbish but it will be chucked out right at the end I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143975_0144143 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145448_0145854 We can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145854_0146061 The weekend is still four days off!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0146751_0146953 I don't actually have that much to do at the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0147125_0147573 to explore any other...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148033_0148494 I can't remember what I'm supposed to do by the way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148494_0148752 Am I supposed to do the summarization thingy-boop?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0149932_0150211 You do. Oh, really?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150211_0150300 Well, I'll do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150440_0150541 I'm sorry, I didn't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150541_0150591 Bye.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150701_0150793 Oh, penis.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151237_0151324 It shouldn't be too difficult.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151324_0151360 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152113_0152802 Well I'm doing communications, which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152802_0153029 what's in two weeks
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153288_0153740 Yeah, it's a 9, 9 equals 10 or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153901_0154781 And then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well and that was in Friday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155035_0155705 Wel, rydw i ddim yn gwneud unrhyw ddarn o'r ôl, felly...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155705_0155763 Please.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159233_0159403 Yeah, if you like.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159403_0159664 Well, you can always decide then. Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159741_0159994 So what are you planning to do over the weekend then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160140_0160327 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160327_0160522 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0163891_0164297 It's just that I think we need to set ourselves some milestones, because otherwise...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164485_0164537 You know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164782_0164907 We talk about it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0166146_0166411 You decide, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0167893_0168151 Well, how about we get it done by then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168151_0168188 I mean.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168444_0168972 yna gallwn ei ddysgu arno yn y cyfres cyflawni.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0170421_0170824 Oh, and the search interface.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171085_0171814 Maybe you should decide pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171814_0172395 And then if you want you can give that to me and I'll build you a nice few dick boxes and drop down menus.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173031_0173365 Oh, dyna ddim yn cynnig.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173365_0173753 That's completely cut and pasted.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173753_0173939 That does not exist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173939_0174331 It's a nicely done room, eh? It's quite a messy machine.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0174331_0175377 Because actually all these things are nicked from, you know, all these drop-down menus and tick boxes are nicked from Google.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175377_0175487 screenshot google
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175679_0176358 Maybe you should make it exist then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176358_0176565 It's gonna be a little difficult, more difficult.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176565_0177317 Yeah, I mean, I was going to, but, you know, the whole drop down menus and stuff, what we want to search for is not quite agreed on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177317_0177653 we never agreed on what we would be able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177980_0178441 Yeah, do you want to just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0178441_0178929 and then we could discuss at next meeting which options we really want to include.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0179135_0179603 Byddwn yn cymryd rhan o ymchwil y llyfr gweirio hefyd i weld beth allai'r hyn ei wneud.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196960_0197135 that we have all the time in the world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0197135_0197413 Yeah, I'll have half an hour and then I'll initially run out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198623_0198860 Actually, it's not even confirmed yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198860_0199278 What? She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199278_0199452 Maybe it doesn't happen at all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199758_0199815 Is it raining?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200409_0200538 I don't think we have a meeting right now.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057088_0057255 We might use them at the moment though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057255_0057500 To work with them, but do we want it to?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057791_0058099 He might want to be able to say, oh just give me what that person's saying.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194976_0195055 Yeah, it's rich.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195055_0195472 There's a photocopy with the code on it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195472_0195877 It's a good way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197101_0197132 So
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197316_0197367 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0198132_0198470 Hopefully it's not that man's, it won't matter.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202080_0202399 Some classes did and some classes didn't. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202399_0202522 We'll check this out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202522_0202670 I think yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0203437_0203591 I don't want.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0206074_0206171 Oh, wait just a second.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209644_0209866 Yeah, I think your comments are basically the same as what you said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209866_0209900 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212177_0212273 Fighting!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212600_0212704 signing off
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212704_0212767 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0000096_0000665 I wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. They really stop.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002147_0002311 No, I didn't.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002707_0002820 Sounds like you've done something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0019845_0020242 to just have the same sort of idiom throughout.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023050_0023188 So then the snow is expensive.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023188_0023463 Like if you want to add more things in the future, we need buttons.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023463_0023492 have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023492_0023804 Where's the menu?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023804_0024042 I guess
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024287_0024381 What?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024381_0024516 I'm gonna go ahead and stay there for a little while.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024516_0024746 I'm back.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030336_0030633 Yeah, but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030633_0030899 and speaker characterization.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030899_0031139 Just some way to sort of leverage that information.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031139_0031547 like we have it, we're doing it. But what, how does it help the browsing?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031547_0031789 What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0036844_0036914 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037629_0037844 such as from the wing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037844_0038530 Is that from any particular window? Like if we want to sort of get, like if we're on the users versus like a topic or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0038530_0038786 Yeah, wait
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0039767_0039903 Right. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040228_0040305 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040426_0040582 I'm just gonna throw.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040582_0040671 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042611_0042816 Actually, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042816_0043260 like we have it so set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043260_0043622 I mean, that's kind of a typical double click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043622_0044106 If you double click on a particular topic or something that it goes to sort of like a default.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044106_0044434 So it will be like all the cases of that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044434_0044882 either whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044882_0045291 and just show up for particular instances of that topic in the meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045291_0045449 Like, I just think to have the default there's.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045449_0045889 So if somebody knows exactly what they want to do, we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045889_0046271 So the double click won't do that. It's just saved from the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0046605_0046933 Well, you might come to us.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047144_0047355 Like we have the right click menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047355_0047814 but instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047814_0048253 Felly, yn y ffordd, mae'r ffurf yma'n ymwneud â'r ffurf mwyaf cyffredin.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050686_0050787 Still coming.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050787_0050871 Hold on there closer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050901_0051245 It's not the end of the world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0056935_0057122 Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0061525_0062063 I think we probably need that though, to have the full flexibility we need to have.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0062635_0063079 The thing is typically though, is someone can have five windows open at the same time. Probably not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0063079_0063650 Yeah, but yeah, it depends
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0064658_0064727 It'd be good to have.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066363_0066473 It's like having a town there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066473_0066660 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0067707_0067992 I don't think John would like him to do that, really.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0070776_0071251 Yeah, or even just have buttons on it, toggle buttons or something on the toolbar for that window.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071444_0071496 Something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071604_0071899 Yeah, it doesn't have to be a tab or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071899_0072058 No, no, it could be like...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072507_0072576 or check marks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072576_0072925 That will reduce the number of windows.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0073677_0073785 It's tough in a way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0075628_0075840 Yeah you can anyways. Can you do that? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076219_0076581 Like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluencies out that we can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076581_0077006 transcript without the discrepancy transcript with a different discipline
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077006_0077098 some of these, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077098_0077878 Yeah, they're definitely going to be in the same one and probably mutually.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077878_0077947 which was...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0080447_0080587 Do you want to do that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082308_0082395 in February.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082870_0083007 you know?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0085854_0085988 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089197_0089641 Is the code accessible? Like the GUI stuff that you've done?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089641_0090010 Like, can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory or something?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090010_0090601 Like if we're gonna just try and take a look or something I can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090732_0091278 If you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, we'll know the directory to get in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091362_0091506 I'm like the...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091705_0091985 I think by default they are.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0092565_0092653 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093261_0093398 Greatly just unveiled to us.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093398_0093531 Okay, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093531_0093627 It's so beautiful.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0096404_0096606 We're eating.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101290_0101489 All those churches.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101489_0101940 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102357_0102731 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102731_0103149 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0103286_0103406 Yeah, well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104422_0104524 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104524_0104872 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104872_0105003 around.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0111840_0111900 Looks great.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0115078_0115204 libraries.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0116848_0117033 I can't do this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117033_0117172 So you're still...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117172_0117196 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117363_0117533 Yes, that's our point.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117533_0118031 I mean this week is only two days out! Well, whatever it was last week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118578_0118835 But you're an SPNLP and SPT, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118835_0118904 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118904_0118986 That's fine.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0119724_0119772 Yeah, oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120585_0120701 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120932_0120956 one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121271_0121856 Yeah, I was thinking the weekend probably started attacking this seriously.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121856_0122358 Hopefully I have something by next week that we can sort of try and integrate into the group.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0122504_0122604 Where else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127378_0127795 Well, they did say it wasn't the most efficient.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127795_0128003 It slowed down quite quickly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0142505_0142623 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0144017_0144115 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145397_0145576 Yeah, for sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145873_0145886 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146004_0146201 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146304_0146826 Still at the bottom of the mountain. How many hours is this?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0147120_0147459 to explore any other thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0148212_0148293 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149554_0149614 Who was it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149880_0150007 YouTube.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150178_0150270 Well, I'll do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150288_0150408 This could be changed.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150408_0150546 Should I do that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150546_0150752 I don't know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150752_0150839 if you want to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150839_0151060 Let's just play around with some extra stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0151060_0151220 Have some time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153025_0153272 Was that in informatics course?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153272_0153425 Yeah, it's a
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153425_0153739 I would play to draw.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0156246_0156562 I'll be happy when this week is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157002_0157469 I think that's about it then. Anything else we need to discuss?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157652_0158052 Did we want to meet before we talk to Steve next week?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158298_0158434 Well, fair enough.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158434_0159102 We'll probably get some work done over the weekend. So I know after the analogy or something, maybe just a little quick little update and just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159414_0159510 What do we get to say?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159510_0159565 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160177_0160605 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160605_0160782 Couldn't be that hard.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160782_0161336 It'll be still a limited version of the next query.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161336_0161524 Good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161524_0161669 Won't be a whole thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161669_0161948 We can just decide the things that we do want to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162062_0162239 Actually, Moses just died on that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162239_0162386 This was for the first time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0163096_0163352 Missouri.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0164731_0165115 Yeah, we get behind schedule pretty quick.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165115_0165239 Like you're saying.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165239_0165581 Actually, do we want to set a date for interim prototype?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165701_0165820 Specifically, I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0174020_0174401 He's actually older than me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0175200_0175308 I'm gonna cry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177666_0177789 Nice, nice.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177789_0177962 Mae'r cyfan hwn yn ystod y wecan.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0179495_0179561 to see what that is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181028_0181137 Just at the base.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181137_0181361 Nawr, yn fawr.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181742_0182107 Just like all that, and seeing the code and just sort of how, just see the basics of what you've done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182107_0182452 Just get a quick look over and just take a tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182497_0182770 Or like, you know, the class paths, all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182770_0183332 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183644_0183749 마지막으로
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183976_0184292 In the morning.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184735_0184862 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184862_0185309 The whole thing is, you know, something like that could happen anytime.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185309_0185690 Like my schedule is like a class, break, class, break, class.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185690_0185974 It's not going to take an hour. Yeah, I know, exactly. That's what I'm thinking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185974_0186364 So something like that, and then if I have a class that you want off, do it. Pick a time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0186612_0186822 반대 방향으로
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187025_0187110 46
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187237_0187767 anytime. Not at noon or two or four.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187767_0188059 No, in between those, like one, three.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189157_0189286 Yeah, that's an option too.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189286_0189383 Do you have turkey?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189596_0189653 It's very good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190197 Or 3.30.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190197_0190345 I just, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190345_0190549 Necessarily.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190727_0190876 Actually, we just had this kid in there, though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0191260_0191791 Can I get through the computer engine here? Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192004_0192373 If you find me, I'll show you where it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192373_0192682 We can look now, afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192682_0192781 Yeah, good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193087_0193279 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193279_0193562 I was just asking Steve about that, whether we can get in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193562_0193757 whether he was going to get us access into the building.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193869_0193922 the computer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194295_0194371 Here we do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194872_0194961 Is there a printer in there too?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195394_0195537 That's a good one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195537_0195672 I'm done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195774_0196406 We could photocopy your assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0196431_0196575 All the comments I have to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197063_0197125 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197125_0197320 Yeah, they'll have a class now and then we'll...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197879_0198035 As long as King Alchi doesn't go late.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199514_0199666 Sounds like me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199840_0199917 Are you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199917_0199994 What? It's supposed to be.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199994_0200131 for reaching.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200785_0200843 That's fantastic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200979_0201027 pictures.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0201901_0202026 Something like that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202026_0202188 Some
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202392_0202622 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202622_0202650 I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202962_0203257 It goes up to the professor whether they did it or not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203257_0203347 Well, I don't feel like it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203347_0203466 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203466_0203610 if you want.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203610_0204092 I think the I.L. will probably have one to make up for missing classes. What?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0204092_0204431 DIL will probably have questions.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0206079_0206202 Oh, I trust you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0207928_0208146 Oh.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208436_0208731 You really want multiple windows from a single app.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208960_0209241 but most will probably want to go with the faults.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209692_0209717 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209873_0210490 And just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210621_0210766 Okay, that's good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210766_0210858 I'm gonna go watch the film.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0002480_0002851 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004285_0004363 Just checking.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004581_0004696 Sağ olsun.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0006202_0006252 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008166_0008661 Very interesting start of the meeting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008661_0008947 I'm gonna sit down.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0023120_0024443 Perfectionist.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024443_0024853 Şimdi böyle konuşuyorlar. İngilizce konuşuyorlar.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024853_0025092 I think that's it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0025508_0025538 I'll see you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0026675_0027547 I'll look at it like when my usual working hours are like from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0027547_0029410 I know you're always online. It always makes me feel bad because when I go to bed at 1 you're still online. You never go to bed. He pretends, always busy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029410_0029595 But I'm never online in the morning.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029595_0030227 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0030764_0031418 Yeah, deal with you, deal with it first and then I'll... I'll look.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0031418_0031794 Was there anything else we wanted to say?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033101_0033591 Probably want to think about if we want to change our goals and stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033591_0034574 I think one thing that we could probably skip totally is the removing things from the audio files.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0034821_0035259 I'm not gonna attempt that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0037281_0037580 Yeah, but that's definitely one thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0041751_0041938 Mike, you haven't really-
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0042617_0044950 Yeah, yeah. More or less. Plus or minus three days. He doesn't have to know exactly. I mean, yeah, it's not finished, but... So I've only got six days to do the topic segment. You don't have any SPNL PSI on, Steve?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053678_0053740 Oh.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053740_0054016 We should probably... Sorry, we should probably...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0056905_0057415 should we? I don't know. I think we might, but are things that we have gathered
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057415_0057650 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057650_0058070 But what about them?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058198_0058396 I don't know what this word is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058396_0058593 skipping the audio.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058775_0059373 Just keep it together on the paper.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059565_0059750 Dat is goed.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059750_0059870 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0060478_0060694 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064215_0064651 Yeah, my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064651_0065348 I don't know if we'd send it in in the afternoon, but I can add a few sentences to what I've done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065842_0065968 This is not right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065968_0066281 Sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066281_0066343 I'm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066765_0066801 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067581_0067962 Well, I still like struggling with Java stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067962_0068274 Yeah, but it's working.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068274_0068805 I think I was wondering about that is how to look at it so much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068805_0069665 but if you guys know how you could do the like from the extract words that you did
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0069665_0070203 Like also extract times.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074139_0074374 So now I can just put it in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074504_0074606 from the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074844_0074902 put on the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0075883_0075962 I'm too good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0089209_0089625 No, okay, good, no. So it's just when we click.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0090755_0090862 at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0115911_0115974 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0118646_0118718 Bye!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0121631_0121738 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0123724_0123835 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0125288_0125530 Yeah, that's just not smart.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0126896_0127147 We were not really well...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127290_0127571 We're not gonna do much more than just look at the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127716_0128450 the room, like the textbook room with the dissonances, because we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna like listen to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128644_0128816 I think this is where I'm doing the audio thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128989_0129377 So, I guess just displaying it is right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0129377_0129503 Yeah, yeah, I did.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0130870_0130929 güzeltir.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131677_0131891 It's probably the best thing to do in Seaside.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131891_0132149 I don't think it's gonna take long to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0153855_0154032 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0169683_0170405 Maybe a sleep.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0170405_0170552 And then, side.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0171979_0172091 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172091_0172338 Yeah, okay. Actually, that's a good idea.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172761_0173069 Stick it together, she'll shine it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0173660_0174199 to anchor it back, any things that I thought was wrong.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174199_0174381 We're changing dialogue.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174381_0174703 I won't back down.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175396_0175540 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175540_0175983 I'll write it on the board line.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175983_0176353 um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012414 I love the timeline.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0013926_0014135 You see it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014135_0014222 Evet, bu şey.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014265_0014294 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014437_0014850 I'm not sure if we need the outline as a prototype.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014850_0015021 I mean, what we're going to put into that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015441_0015688 Yeah, because I think that's been what we're doing here, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015688_0015753 Hello.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025379_0025658 Yeah, well, I mean, it's up to you if you want to keep going with that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025658_0025799 I'm happy to do some as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025799_0025919 I have lots of time tonight.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026045_0026664 A'n ni'n mynd i'w ddangos i chi. Gallwch wneud y gwefan.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026664_0026730 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027533_0027852 I know, you're always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027852_0028436 It always makes me feel bad because when I go to bed at like 1 you're still online.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028436_0028592 You're never gonna die.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028865_0029045 Yeah, he pretended.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029045_0029133 Always busy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029133_0029280 You should write that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029280_0029409 So maybe...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032386_0032508 Well, that's the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032508_0032636 Oh, I see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032636_0032810 Oh, this is the one that... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0034547_0034909 That's what I thought as well. I mean, are we actually going to attempt that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035060_0035247 I don't think so. I'm too big.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035247_0035573 I think that's going to be, we don't even know how to approach that at the moment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036630_0036715 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036715_0036928 Yeah, yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036928_0037935 So maybe I mean we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0037935_0038266 but put it under changes since the initial specification.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0038266_0038901 and say we decided that time was too short.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0039384_0039848 We would prefer to concentrate on the main.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0040496_0041100 And I think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041252_0041505 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041758_0041920 Mike, you have a lot of precious time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041920_0042435 I'm gonna go to UK again. Yeah, nice to talk to you. Nice to meet you. Best friend.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042609_0042719 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042719_0042856 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045213_0045428 and you can say yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045428_0046024 We're still aiming for the development to be completely in our joint.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0047485_0047593 to the panel.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048189_0048321 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048321_0048439 I really want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048439_0048678 It's not going to be difficult.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048678_0049161 i gael y cyfle i gyd o ran y math o wybodaeth sydd yn dod yn y ffaith metadata.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049161_0049366 That's gotta be new work.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049366_0049523 So it's definitely going to be something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0050130_0050484 Yeah, they might turn out even more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0052660_0052741 Yeah, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053015_0053059 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053774_0054353 Rydyn ni'n gobeithio gwneud arweinyddiaeth ar gyfer y pachiau hefyd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0054353_0054961 That's what he hinted that we should also indicate who is responsible for what.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0055764_0056002 way to put you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0060677_0060763 Oh my god.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0061496_0061766 Have you managed any further on the search thing?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0062920_0062973 I'll be working on it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0063613_0063708 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0076781_0077134 Felly, a wnaethoch chi wneud un o'r enwau?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0077134_0077273 Is there something that I should know?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078221_0078524 No, since you don't do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078524_0078671 But I wouldn't deny it does.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079643_0079886 After the camp.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079886_0080250 Oh my goodness, I have cancer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0083744_0083850 It was so beautiful.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084213_0084627 At the moment is there a window that comes up?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084627_0084835 What was that? The second result, pain?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084835_0085080 or is it zoomed in and out?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0085080_0085345 Um, I thought we sort of...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090405_0090683 But then you can't see
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090855_0091354 You wouldn't want to compare one topic result with one summary result, would you?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091653_0091831 where we see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091831_0092168 Yeah, if you get results for the same meeting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092292_0092417 So let's start with the top.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092417_0092558 That's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093213_0093492 I mean, we could order them by meeting, for example.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093846_0093986 Reorder
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093986_0094497 Yeah, well, I mean, if that's the second step, the first question is, do we want to order them?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0094497_0094659 How do we want to order them in the first place?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0095725_0095842 Yeah, maybe we should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098204_0098433 Yeah, why don't you just, um...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098544_0098638 Color code those.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098797_0099022 Sometimes it can increase like that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101350_0101436 I would never if you...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101561_0101936 If you do it straight from, you know, you get the result.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101936_0102270 and then there's some if statement saying, just put it straight on the unit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0102270_0102935 Rock bottom level saying if you found a segment then color it, print it, and use red or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103083_0103179 as opposed to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103884_0103924 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104204_0104330 Well, trying to do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104991_0105085 Oh, dude.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105335_0105452 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105878_0106013 Oh, I see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106358_0106545 I
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106955_0107583 Yeah, I mean at the moment it works with highlighting in the transcript window, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0109010_0109145 What do you mean you two weren't with him?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0110572_0111480 Yeah, I mean the whole, what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pain made by night.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111480_0111676 I am not sure what's going on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111951_0112094 I'm seeing...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112214_0112478 Dwi ddim yn gwybod pa mae'n ei enw.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112478_0112878 and that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112878_0113350 As I said, if you left click on something, for example, it highlights automatically.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0113350_0113593 So maybe it comes with something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114147_0114464 No, I'm sure there's a lot of pain in it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114635_0114909 Text area. Yeah, that's another one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114909_0115049 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115049_0115317 None in Texas. Most of the things are called none.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115317_0115547 Yeah, why? What's it got to mean?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115547_0115719 Nid yw'n ddifrifol.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122144_0122353 Why do we want it in XML then?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122353_0122857 I mean I thought we would just selectively write the XML that we've got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123113_0123303 So as opposed to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123577_0123610 Yes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123720_0124313 Yn unig, ddifrifwch unrhyw ffyrdd o'r rhaglenau a'r rhaglenau rydyn ni eisiau, yn unig, yn ddifrifol.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124313_0124485 At the moment it prints out all of them.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124485_0124910 Wel, dod yn ôl i'r fflwb nesaf, a byddai'n rhedeg rhai o'r cyfrinadau.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124910_0125118 Not store it at all, whatsoever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0125724_0125789 Alright.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129048_0129102 So I guess.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129404_0129617 Yeah, yeah, you don't really need to do much more with it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129617_0129694 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0131930_0132233 I don't think it's going to take long to produce anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0132233_0133122 Dyma ddysguau, nid yw'n ddod yn ddiweddar, ond yw gweithiau.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0134416_0135016 You can nearly do it together with the transcription, with the original transcription, having one parallel.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135186_0135590 So if certain, you know, if it's a proper word,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135590_0136024 print it on both paints and if it's not proper wet then print it on only one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136024_0136232 I mean that's not fancy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136493_0136570 Yeah, you probably can.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137075_0137136 So then...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137251_0138184 Y ffordd da i'w wneud, ond nid yn un, yw os nad yw unrhyw un eisiau edrych ar y
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138184_0138407 you know, the chop file and you don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138548_0138826 But I mean you can, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138826_0139583 you can write we can write something like we'll try and do it on the fly and observe if it's not gonna it's gonna take too long
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0139583_0140140 Ac os ydych chi'n meddwl y byddai'n cymryd eich cymorth, dweud yna.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0140299_0140382 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0141684_0141738 Bye.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0151881_0152103 That's what programming is all about, I'm afraid.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153323_0153432 That was the higher people.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153895_0153967 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154087_0154810 Yeah, why don't you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154810_0154970 if you want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154970_0155409 I personally don't want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0155409_0155526 I don't want to do it superficially.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018361_0018535 Yeah, kidding.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018535_0018610 O, jest.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019159_0019391 You can't have, yeah, it says screenshot on there and stuff.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023970_0024180 I thought you were going to tell us you got it wrong anyways.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036472_0036842 Should have waited more time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0037097_0037360 Yeah, have them do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038504_0038624 We decided to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038837_0039136 I've always felt there are more important things to do in our time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0039295_0039468 We would prefer to call it a day.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041533_0041627 Yeah, it's good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041627_0041784 That should have a section.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042375_0042600 Bestfrau umtragen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042801_0043608 Plus or minus three days. He doesn't have to know exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0044105_0044380 Mae gen i ddau dydd i wneud y segment ar y topi.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0045439_0045574 So we're still aiming for that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046016_0046324 It's a biggie character isn't it? It's supposed to be done already.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046324_0046575 Yeah, two days ago. Um...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047298_0047592 give me a week and I'll tell you the answer
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047900_0048145 Maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0048322_0048580 I really want to do it. It's not wrong.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049534_0049781 Yeah, we might make it disappear, but we might thin it down a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049921_0050095 Bújj már le a világára, Marta!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050095_0050312 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050861_0051348 The tommy segmentation with LC-SEG and textiles is basically done.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0052069_0052298 Let's see what happens.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0055240_0055341 Yeah, pretty much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0065809_0065877 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0066825_0067239 How about any underlying data for it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067239_0067390 Felly, dyma'r ddeunydd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067390_0067474 Sağol canım
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0068144_0068204 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070071_0070141 Please come to the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070141_0071209 yeah we're just when he pulls up the segments part of that one of those one of the attributes you do get attributes
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071209_0071456 Yn ôl i'r llysedd o adroddiadau.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071456_0071927 So that will tell you what attributes it's got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071927_0072435 and then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard code and say look, get me the time stamps.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0072435_0073145 Felly dweud yna, dyna'r method yw dyna'r method, a'i gweithio yn y cyfnod.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073145_0073437 Okay. And that will tell you the start times and end times.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073437_0073534 I think it would set us a double.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074447_0074908 iawn, dyna ar y elementau sy'n ddiwethaf iawn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074908_0075230 Mae'r cyfeiriad yn ddeunydd ddim yn iawn.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088240_0088442 What happened? You confused me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088442_0088847 Do you have three separate windows for the three separate different types of windows?

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115991_0116432 I like to object to what I'm laughing at, that's why they're in today.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121828_0122215 There is some bizarre method that puts things back into excellent form.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0123311_0123783 Yn ystod y cyfnod, dylen ni ddewis beth sydd eisiau, dim ond y rhan fwyaf o'r cyfnod.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124458_0124617 Yeah. Or just put a new float in it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124617_0124713 Iawn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124713_0124801 Sensing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124801_0124917 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125458_0125580 says something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125580_0125640 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125789_0125942 Yn ystod y cyfnod hwnnw, mae'r cyfnod hwnnw wedi'i ddweud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125942_0126120 This makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126120_0126533 But that will mean that you can only do things on, actually no, because you can do things on word level.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126533_0126623 So yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129316_0129464 This one is tough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129659_0129757 That's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130301_0130473 Would just be a blur like a summary
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130473_0130975 dydyn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud y byddwn ni ddim yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dwe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131287_0131598 And then it will look ugly probably because it will look just black and white.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131598_0131725 Literally, well it's dark so...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0132163_0132382 use anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133236_0133358 It doesn't qualify.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133510_0133859 So then it just goes through and says that this word equals that imprint.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0134183_0134337 İşte bu açılış derneği.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136501_0136598 Yeah, you probably could.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136598_0136789 That's probably less, but we know that's more difficult.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136789_0136955 You just need to flatten the code out a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136955_0137127 Mew.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0138300_0138507 you don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140016_0140051 should
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140051_0140536 They're just BF statements.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140536_0140696 I was just thinking of the lines in this copy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0141246_0141295 We'll see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0143934_0144261 Although unapplied is to be expected.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144261_0144569 even trying to read it in XML which I've always complicated enough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144569_0145137 I gave up doing that completely. I devoted back to night stuff because it was not too much easier.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145283_0145518 So we do it with not stuffed.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145518_0145969 oedd yn ddifrifol iawn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146180_0146289 I couldn't believe it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146289_0147004 Mae angen i chi ddefnyddio modelau obiect, fel y peth nes a'r gêm. Mae'n bwysig.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0147004_0147093 So, sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0157867_0157939 I spent too little.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0158908_0159085 Yeah, it's after it's loaded.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159237_0159400 It's just a, it's just a fallout, really.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159400_0159494 Yeah, try it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0160891_0161131 I'm clearly the future work in my own section.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0161282_0162274 I just said, I said, well, that's so far and what I'm going to do. Yeah, well, maybe some some issues.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162274_0162383 Yeah, like the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162560_0162760 Mae'n rhaid i ni ddod yn ddiweddarach.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162760_0162852 Então é isso aí.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162852_0163194 Sometimes it's easier to have the top in this own instructions. Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163194_0163417 I took about three characters in two weeks.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163985_0164101 goals.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164101_0164355 Yeah, that's right. Bullet points.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164381_0164747 Because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing here... Yeah.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003903_0003990 MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003990_0004240 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004240_0004381 I'll take notes as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004495_0004612 Oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004745_0005954 I guess the first thing I just wrote did a really sort of brief version of what we have to do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0005954_0006231 Peace.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012470_0012730 I was just copying the one straight over the other documents.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012730_0013102 So it's all whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0013772_0013822 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014111_0014174 Oh, shoot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014174_0014244 Sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015004_0015184 Well, just sort of. Well, the thing is, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015184_0015707 We're going to be touching on all that during the other part of the program. Yeah, because that's been what we're doing here, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015707_0015897 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015897_0016426 Well, it's just something that he had mentioned in the previous, like just to sort of have a prototype together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016426_0016728 So we're just saying that we could potentially do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016728_0016792 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016792_0016898 Peace, Hasan.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017730_0017785 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017785_0018043 Like the thing is I was thinking even in the stuff that I was doing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018043_0018395 just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018395_0018519 Can any of the laptops...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018519_0018560 So, we...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018560_0018829 Oh, yes. Actually, I have that at the very end of the screenshot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018829_0018936 Put that in chop on this plate.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018936_0019111 I didn't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020934 Anyways, so, um, so yeah, this just very general structure. I guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021133_0021163 Fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021313_0021454 Good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021454_0021977 So I know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this I could do that before I make one to you guys.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021977_0022293 Otherwise, no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0022293_0022953 Did someone else want to throw it together? Actually, I can probably still throw it together if you want. I'll put your parts into this one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023125_0023329 Perfectionist.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023630_0023745 지금까지...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023745_0024214 Let's just cut out the middle man.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0024214_0024440 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0027526_0027739 I know, you're always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028668_0028943 Just leave your computer on, maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028943_0029179 You pretend, always busy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0029731_0030110 Notice that noise.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030110_0030238 and
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030488_0030619 So I'll send it off to you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030619_0030654 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031329_0031464 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031677_0031881 Was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031881_0032249 I mean, essentially, it was what you can't see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032249_0032460 Oh, there's more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032460_0032772 Oh, this is the one that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032772_0033027 Yeah, yeah, it was just copied straight out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0036788_0037258 I must have discovered some sort of time warp thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0038142_0038232 investigation.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041160_0041286 This smells.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041286_0041566 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041566_0041631 mükemmel
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042654_0042791 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042881_0042968 That's very true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042968_0043351 Plus or minus 3 days. He doesn't have to know exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043351_0043505 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043505_0043786 I mean, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044331_0044624 Jesus.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044624_0045064 You don't have any SPL PSIs do you?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046238_0046442 Oh really? Yeah, two days ago.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046442_0046502 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046502_0047118 For one of those, something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0047576_0047898 Like, should we put a hint that something like that might happen into the document?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0048484_0048561 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049218_0049277 You're welcome.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049277_0049343 Naturally.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049542_0049639 I forgot Mickey disappeared.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0051551_0051685 tuned
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0054984_0055312 Like probably just compromise trigger.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055312_0055519 It's essentially the same as it was.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055519_0055766 More detail specifically.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057504_0057594 Can we close the park?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057638_0057891 I think so, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057891_0058016 But
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0058470_0058757 What if we're skipping the audio one?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059159_0059383 Are you taking the floor?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059383_0059545 Have you taken any more of a look at it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059545_0059671 I do this once a week.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059852_0059926 You could probably.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060166_0060504 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060504_0060724 We could just mention it all day.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060724_0061147 Like I'll claim one, you claim the other for the search things and then we can leave that one as a joint one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061295_0061394 Come on, Vicky.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061780_0062365 I found finally today something that I can build it in and I should have something for tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0062365_0063158 I should at least, very least have a GUI. I'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063158_0063436 I want to get something. I want to see this. I want to get it together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063436_0063952 I have an image of my mom. I just want to see it on the thing and then get my skin shot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065078_0065557 I mean if you write the sentences first as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065557_0065912 I mean, with the attention that this has gotten.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065912_0066273 Sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066273_0066537 Oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066537_0066801 Do you want to get something?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0067941_0067973 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077159_0077621 I haven't made a lot of changes to it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077621_0077969 so I might just delete what I've done and copy it in from yours.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077969_0078306 Because I'm sure you've probably made some changes already.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078306_0078362 Oh, gross.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078362_0078473 It's just running around.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078539_0078676 I thought you said... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078676_0078817 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078856_0079508 I thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were going to fix those on the weekend or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079508_0079598 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0079847 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079969_0080142 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080142_0080966 All of their stuff up there. Actually, I'm going to try and minimize the amount of changes in the e-tail browser anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080966_0081036 città.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081165_0081248 这一边也是
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081248_0081582 Actually, just to clarify, last week when we were talking about our search results,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081582_0082029 Like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082114_0082502 Do we want separate result panes for each of those?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082502_0083092 or do we want them all in one pane with an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083092_0083471 so that when they click on that, it's going to go to the relevant thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083471_0083998 Like just if they check all three say topics, how three different windows come up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0084148_0084359 or three like so.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085039_0085733 What we sort of discussed last week was to have it on the same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085733_0086046 So beyond the search window bottom half of the search window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086046_0086485 I know we still want to keep it that way, but that's so that's what I was gonna be working
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086485_0086802 So it's just like you click those and it just loads up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086802_0087255 Yeah, split stop thing into two or three or whatever it is. One, two, three, depending on which one you're on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087255_0087384 ones are check.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087384_0087866 So if you want to do it that way, you know, like it probably doesn't matter too much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087866_0088246 Just trying to think if there's going to be any other issues down the road.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0088813_0089409 No, just pains, just result of pains. Okay, not three different ones. No, no, no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089409_0089503 C'est bon.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089503_0089859 So it's just when we click topics and summaries for what we want to search.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089859_0090212 there will be two result pains.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090212_0090467 I don't know, really tops.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090467_0090932 But then you can't see all of them at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0091303_0091783 Well, it's no, but the thing is, if you're looking, if you can check them both, you'll see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092178_0092282 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092314_0093320 So the semolina and the topical and the transplant. Or we could just put them all into one result pane.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0093620_0094088 Reorder yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094088_0094233 That's what that's about.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094233_0094296 Second.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094729_0094978 I think, yeah, probably by meeting makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094978_0095288 I mean, essentially they're in time order.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095288_0095598 So that kind of makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095767_0095835 You should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096204_0096458 Should be easy. No, I don't want to.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096458_0096585 Should be forgotten.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0098888_0099364 Sometimes in a case like that like a run across some other languages.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099364_0099946 It's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it's put into a list box or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099946_0100175 It's hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100175_0100452 and then if we're highlighting something in the transcript window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100452_0101260 it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a list box, an item in a list box.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101260_0101496 No, but if you...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101496_0101599 Where is this coming from?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103036_0103108 As a
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103329_0103842 Um, yeah, it's just like from past experience. There's goofy little things that happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103842_0104599 and just to let you say certain things and just kind of try to go to a different window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0104599_0105080 So if you want to go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105080_0105308 At that point, that's where it starts getting a little bit tricky.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105308_0105835 because you're working with an event handler within the one panel or a loose box or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105835_0105890 Oh.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106024_0106677 I don't know. There are ways around it, but, you know, whether people will figure something out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106677_0106952 or don't get severe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106952_0107083 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107588_0107656 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107851_0108601 I think he was saying that as long as we implement that interface, it should work with anything that we do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108601_0108763 like highlighting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108763_0109120 What do you mean you need to work with him?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109120_0109343 Wasn't Jonathan changing the number?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109343_0109760 I think it was just like, as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109760_0110058 we should be able to have that highlighting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110058_0110116 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110116_0110158 MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0113476_0113968 Okay, maybe I should use that as well anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115367_0115504 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115704_0115871 Oh, I can't believe this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0119968_0120335 We were just going to have to do this word.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0120335_0121016 like not as XML, just sort of as a... What was that? Text file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121016_0121339 transcript. No, because then we need all the other data if we want to keep it a transcript.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121635_0121783 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121783_0121815 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125252_0125286 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125286_0125531 Yeah, that's not smart.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125531_0125664 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125664_0125902 That's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125902_0126033 Actually, but this makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0126624_0126989 If we're going to do the x-male, fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129344_0129433 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129704_0130120 But it's like, well, how would we display the like, if we do take this fluency, so I'm just, you know,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130120_0130471 I think they just want to... It would just be a blurb, like a summary.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130967_0131486 Unless we extract that over to the file when we create the text file. Yeah, then it will look ugly probably because it will look displeasing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0131568_0131631 That's flitting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140401_0140531 It's working.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140531_0141101 I was just thinking as well, it's probably been used like XSLT to kind of just transform it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141101_0141775 just transforms
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141775_0142195 And then it's kind of like there's usually things built into, well, it should be built into John.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142195_0142837 process XML into it. Like it just creates whatever file it's going to be in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142837_0143107 A couple of years ago.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143107_0143373 That might even be an easier way.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143373_0143725 And then that way we could even pre-process that beforehand.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143725_0143963 I don't know. We don't want to have to do that, right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143963_0144215 Although unapplied to me, it tastes good pretty much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144532_0144657 I gave up doing that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144657_0144731 I believe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0145444_0145524 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146551_0146596 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146596_0146733 Yeah, it was serious.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146895_0146946 kitchen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147168_0147522 I was thinking I might try and talk to Jonathan.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147522_0147857 Like just to see what they, what system they use to develop this stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147857_0148685 It would be nice to have all the tools there and just have the object model and just plug and play with everything and just actually use the system.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148685_0148921 You're at a higher level rather than kind of.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148921_0149202 play around with a little bit of code and modifying your code.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149202_0149408 Yeah, so we just sort of see what they're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149408_0149827 I might try and contact them and see if there's...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149964_0150225 And hence the gigahertz.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150225_0150542 Just to get things moving at a higher level.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150688_0151137 It seems to be more interesting to use it as a real developer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151304_0151743 It just seems like a little tinkering around here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151889_0151929 That's cool.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152034_0152305 No, it shouldn't be.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152305_0152397 It should be higher level.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152397_0153316 conceptual and coming up with brilliant ideas and just reality.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0153441_0153811 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0155864_0156372 Like the thing that I was thinking there as well, once it's done for one meeting, it's done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156372_0156430 It's fun.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156430_0156582 text file or XML or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156582_0157089 Yeah, just it doesn't make any difference really either way.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157089_0157402 It's like, if it's fast enough, why not fly an insurance?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157402_0157749 That's about the only issue I have with it on the fly, whether it's fast enough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157956_0158182 Especially with Java.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0158182_0158649 If it's loading the file, we can turn on the processing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0159496_0159838 With a mental memory. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161181_0161213 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161805_0161922 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0162054_0162383 um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163146_0163210 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163372_0163537 I think that does make sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163537_0164018 Maybe at the end, maybe just a point for all the things that we're still working on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164018_0164192 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164712_0164801 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0165141_0165226 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168501_0168596 Sweet.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171165_0171447 Or she'll just take it from there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171447_0171516 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171516_0171724 How come?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171724_0172114 I can get you if you want to see it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172114_0172473 Actually, that's a good idea. I'll take one quick look over.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172473_0172728 try and get it as good as I think that we can.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0173283_0173628 I'm going to leave you my idea.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0174290_0174848 They were changing dialogue back.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0175479_0175581 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176364_0176543 Oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176882_0177179 That's smart.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0005327_0005656 Did we get seven out of ten for real? Yep.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0010714_0010759 MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012507_0012860 I think there is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012860_0014128 Just because the topic box and all this is based on a non-move night text area or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014128_0014333 ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014333_0014626 It has some sort of highlighting stuff there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014626_0014856 So you should probably look at the.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0015536_0015731 I'm not sure if it's in there, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0016668_0016786 뭐야?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018250_0018339 You get it.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0021698_0021836 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0022987_0023159 Okay, yeah, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023159_0023237 But that's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023237_0023267 I want to

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0024002_0024042 All right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0026456_0026737 I'm not sure they can mark us.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0031624_0031695 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0033862_0034307 What the easiest thing to do. How do you want to do this bloke?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034307_0034400 Just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034863_0035710 So what we'll whenever we open a window for one speaker. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036852_0036935 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036935_0037078 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0038146_0038190 How is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042122_0042347 The more present
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042347_0042747 Although we could do... We could do the one highlighted as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0044963_0045399 Byddai hynny'n cyflwyno'r hyn y dywedodd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045399_0045889 that you want to see per topic, you want to see which one spoken most.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045889_0046420 Felly gallwch chi ddod o'r blaen ar y rhain topegau.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047031_0047163 Diolch yn fawr.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047936_0048004 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0048166_0048640 Felly, ie, pethau arall fel dod yn ôl, siarad. Ie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0049178_0049243 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055128_0055476 Pōtoha, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā koe, tēnā
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055476_0055829 I could use that for the topic.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056075_0056113 So that would.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056541_0056607 That wasn't long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0057730_0058078 Because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0058078_0058747 Mae gennych ffordd o ddod allan ar y ffyrdd sy'n rhoi'ch llist o'r cyfarfodydd sy'n cynnwys y topeg honno?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060366_0060622 So how would you calculate that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060622_0061042 Would you do the summarisation as you populate it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061042_0061259 Iawn, dwi'n gwybod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061553_0062005 Alright, so that is all stored together. The speaker class knows about all of that stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062005_0062172 All right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062567_0062708 Ich fand's gut.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062708_0063054 So have you done these yet? No, no, but they are a little difficult.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063054_0063276 Just got to decide on what we want to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063527_0063800 I thought the other stuff was more important anyway, so I did that first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063948_0064594 Felly, mae'n unig sy'n gallu ei ddefnyddio nawr. Gallaf ei wneud heno?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0066667_0066722 Oh, that's neat.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067308_0067648 Wel, dwi'n gwybod pan fydd hwnnw'n gallu defnyddio.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067648_0067710 you can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068138_0068232 What do you mean he picked you?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068232_0068607 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068607_0068783 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070272_0070386 В своем случае.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070386_0070452 So where's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070452_0070695 Is that stored in the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070898_0071135 On your hand, actually, not on that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0071468_0071520 Actually, I just...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0072563_0073206 What are you wanting to write that in directly or what do you want to do? What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073206_0073320 if you want to change my code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073552_0074028 Do you want to change that the original umbrella file in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074028_0074121 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074288_0074356 Have you done that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074568_0074831 Oh, okay, so not the actual one, but a copy of it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075146_0075269 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075269_0075311 Oh, cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075690_0075818 Well, just tell us when.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075818_0076625 Iawn, iawn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0076625_0076783 the remaining changes to it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0077208_0077283 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0078579_0078992 Felly yw hynny'r hyn rydych chi'n gweithio ar nawr i ddangos canlyniadau yn dda?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0079726_0079893 I mean the highlighting stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0081352_0082292 Actually for any text area, whatever it is, they define some handy highlights on that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082292_0082443 So you've got different highlights.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082443_0082847 you've got just look at the what they wrote about it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082847_0083407 We've got user highlights, selection highlights, time highlights.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083564_0083648 Something else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083866_0084550 So you can quite easily, if your text area is called area, you just do area.sethighlights or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084550_0084615 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084903_0085417 That's the way I did it to highlight, to cross highlight a topic in the transcripts.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0085647_0085685 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091133_0091466 But if you don't...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091466_0092196 Ie, mae gen i'r holl ysbyty i'w ddweud. Er mwyn i ddweud, oh, nid!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092196_0092783 Has it talked to you now? It's that nice machine again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092912_0093190 I've spent too much time on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093287_0093764 Alright, well I've been doing some random pop-up windows for the speaker characterization which is good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093764_0093949 Sorry, feel that in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093949_0094239 The windows are all there now after lots of moving.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094447_0094830 Well, you know, just the pop-up. The pop-up. It's difficult, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094830_0095852 because it basically has to set up like 10 pop-up windows in memory as in already initialize them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0095852_0097625 because there might be 10 speakers. And I'm working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the topics of the meetings that topic was mentioned in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0097625_0098398 And I have a question about the... you said we wanted a start screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098398_0098686 what kind of starts we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098686_0099910 Do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser or something? It's an FSD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0099910_0100194 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0101016_0101819 So do we want to yeah maybe we could write and I like that. It's called the top of the window saying welcome to meet your browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0102824_0103036 ยิ่งเท่า.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103036_0103596 Yn y moment, y ffordd y mae'n ei fod, mae'n menu drosglwyddoedd, fel y gwelwch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103596_0104380 with all the... and that because it's the dialogue class that you use there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105197_0105814 I mean, I think they should have two options, either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105814_0106146 Stupid NFTs.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106641_0106681 C'est pas mal.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106846_0106986 I don't think...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0109093_0109356 Can you not get this normal object?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0110808_0111239 I suppose we wouldn't want to use, yeah we wouldn't want to use NXT at the beginning anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111239_0111597 because we don't want to search locally.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111597_0111799 So, so that's a.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112036_0112390 If they wanted to, then they would open the meeting first, right? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112390_0113079 So let's say you have two options, either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0114980_0115106 And then why do we want default?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0115106_0115222 I mean, just.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117710_0117866 Yeah, the local stretch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117866_0118149 We can't do the levels without trying.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118149_0118201 I'm pretty happy with it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118903_0119072 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0119572_0120392 Iawn, mae'r ffaseg gweithredol globol yn rhoi'r adnoddau'r ddynion, yn y bôn, i'r sefydliadau leol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0120772_0120979 Well yeah, that's always going to be the case with search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0127554_0128257 I mean you can, you know, the option is to do a search in the way that, if you do a global search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128257_0128525 First and first step, only return the meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128525_0129236 as in, not even meetings, but the name of the meetings. So, you know, say you want to search for the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129236_0129671 and then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129671_0130137 And then you can decide, well, I want to search on this and this and this meeting, or only on this meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0131846_0131917 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0133484_0134502 There is, yeah, in one of the papers they have names, which has a... Like the work of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0134502_0135159 even better
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135159_0135296 That's a working group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135328_0135540 I love that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136130_0136376 So I put that in already too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136513_0136562 Let's go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136797_0137361 So yeah, again, concretely to the startup, startup libraries, we know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0138687_0138799 What? I'm stretching.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139654_0139748 Yeah, how is that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139748_0140090 I mean, do you think you would have time for that as well?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0143830_0144030 It would have been like a lifestyle.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0146883_0147426 So the general scope would that be for the whole of the language?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0147621_0147931 Well, you know, it's my house.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148152_0148272 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148571_0149086 So what would the, if we had these face topics, what would they look like? A bunch of keywords.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149086_0149296 bunch that's really easy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149296_0149507 Is it just a list of keywords or something?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0150892_0151721 Because that would be really handy then, we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151721_0151946 Because if you just have the segmentation, that's great.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151946_0152612 ond nid ydym yn gallu rhannu at y segmented cyfraith.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154848_0154929 You're not alone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154929_0155000 Probably not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0157347_0157497 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158504_0158755 Yeah, that's why I'm doing it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158755_0158866 We're just like, oh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158866_0158946 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159488_0159909 Sort of but then the main idea was more like to speed it up to be the same jump
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159909_0160355 because NXT, the whole of the covers were just not for you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160355_0160440 That way, slow down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160737_0161085 No, but the general inverted vowel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161085_0161177 It still uses a bit
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161177_0161402 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161402_0161533 That would just be nice extra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161826_0162209 Yeah, I wasn't sure. I don't think we have that in the document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162322_0162464 I'm a teacher.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162464_0162631 Dweud e, dim ond ystod yr anfoniad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163367_0163566 Yeah, I mean, if you have time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163566_0163798 She's only going to do this for a short time anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163798_0164155 because I mean then then it would give you like if you search for work
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164155_0164659 it will give you the meetings but also how often that word occurred in that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164659_0164887 We'll just give you a rank.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164944_0164998 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0165287_0165337 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166254_0166691 Iawn, ond byddai'n ddefnyddiol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166691_0167133 Yeah, if you search for language and you return like, you know...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0167133_0167654 Yn ystod yr ystodau, rydych chi am weld pa mor bwysig yw'r cyfarfodydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfarfodydd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169068_0169150 language and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169607_0169964 Sunny days.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171103_0171347 And then add those up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171347_0171413 Pictures of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171413_0171547 The thing is, the thing is that...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0184287_0185068 So, come back and stop screaming. I'm very unsure about what I've actually looked like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185068_0185739 I mean, we want to for the part where you can choose, choose the meeting, what kind of information you want to have about the meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185739_0186339 I mean the longer name obviously, if there is one, because they don't all have long names.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186339_0186624 What, the users that spoke?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186624_0186781 Can you use this after a power?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186781_0187146 then that's pretty much the same for the same group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187463_0187523 a set of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187875_0188443 Yeah, just to give them an idea, a general idea of what there is, so they can pick a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190217_0190360 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190360_0191168 Rwy'n byw ymlaen at y cyfarfod lle mae Sownes yn siarad o rai fath o grwp ymchwil.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191168_0191313 on that first meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191313_0191358 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193761_0193944 Can't remember which one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193944_0194339 because we just want to have a way of, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0194339_0195069 Because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting, they can browse through that quite nicely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0196708_0196761 What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197378_0197509 or how are we going to do that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197755_0197983 They can have the site.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198418_0198689 But that would defy the whole point of browsing, right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198689_0198979 If you only wanted to look at all five.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198979_0199684 You can't have a favourite now. Just scroll down the list and find your favourite one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0199684_0200295 Yeah, it's not enough animation. It's not like they come back every day and do the same browsing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0200295_0200898 Dat is goed zo.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0201511_0201565 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0203619_0203867 So we can sort of follow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0204433_0204785 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205023_0205757 I wasn't going to put any help in there, any explanation of how the browser works to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205757_0205864 So interesting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207091_0207139 watching.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207616_0207937 But I mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208152_0208271 Yeah, we'll search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208271_0208431 Even if it's just that two things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0209821_0210117 Ie, mae'r holl hyn yn digwydd mewn sefydliad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210117_0210615 Basically either the user knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just clicks on it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210615_0211023 or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks at his
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213265_0213415 Oh, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213415_0213551 Inside the search engine, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0215327_0215467 Yeah, that's what...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216096_0216266 No, that looks about right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216266_0216811 Ond dwi'n ddim yn siŵr am sut i roi'r holl wybodaeth yno.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216811_0217577 نريد المزيد من المعلومات عن المستخدمين

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217863_0218569 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0219105_0219240 Just drop down a second.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220084_0220230 Yeah, me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220271_0220456 That's the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0221530_0222119 No, no, no, I'm not saying you can pick a user, but it should come up with some list.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222119_0222777 but an extended list of the meetings, so you know, BDR, whatever it was called,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222777_0223344 And then it gives you the longer name, blah. And then it gives you the participants.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223637_0223889 I'm just thinking that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223959_0224134 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224134_0224316 But then... Is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224316_0224556 Na, dim yn hollol, rwy'n credu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224556_0224692 I told him, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224692_0224950 I've not tried that yet but I'm scared.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225317_0225963 yeah I'm not sure is that very is that not annoying if you have to get out of the bloody way
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225963_0226273 Yes!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226273_0226386 I do that a lot don't I?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226386_0226994 I wneud y peth hwn, mae angen i chi ddweud y byddwch chi'n cael ymwneud â'r un peth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226994_0227437 yeah that's why you can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0229882_0230290 It would just be nice to have some basic information on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230290_0230807 Ie, rwy'n meddwl bod y datblygiad hwnnw'n mynd ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230807_0230954 Yeah, maybe that's the best idea then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230954_0231487 So you've got a drop down menu, a search button, not search, go button.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0231713_0231788 And then...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232000_0232366 some sort of fields which updates dynamically depending on what you've highlighted.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232710_0232798 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0233635_0233667 See?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234346_0234496 What does a normal actually stand for?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234696_0234930 Not very nice.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235811_0235971 Oh no.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235971_0236358 You've got lots of norm something and then knight something and then end something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0236758_0236869 ones that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238062_0238529 And most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying, you've got to update this Jonathan.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238529_0238836 This is unintelligible.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238898_0239158 Great.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0240763_0241021 Anyway, now I'm done with you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241021_0241212 Mae'n dweud wrthym.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241212_0241619 Great, so anyone else got anything to say?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0242119_0242579 Do we want another meeting at the end of the week with Pernod?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243033_0243115 Yeah, I was not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243115_0243612 I mean, I think I'm going to do quite a bit of work this week, so I'll have probably more to talk about.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243817_0243898 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244842_0244907 If you like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244907_0245123 We can discuss that on Friday if you have it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0245675_0245756 What time is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0247755_0248019 I've got a drop to the point now, 10 to 2.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0253117_0253282 It's a straight slice.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0254517_0254873 I'll write this meeting up and I'll send it to him as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0255359_0256031 Because she's not here. No, I mean that she collected... Oh, right, okay, sorry. Yeah. It's cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256031_0256612 I collect meeting some people. I thought somebody was collecting them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256612_0256834 We should probably do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257021_0257501 So can we just repeat briefly what we've spoken about?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257501_0258117 So we've done progress on the speaker characterization. Who does the speaker characterization?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258117_0258709 We mentioned topic labeling with keywords.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258709_0259136 Rydyn ni wedi sgwrsio a oedd y set yn rhaid i'w gael ei rannu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0259136_0259489 And Michael, do you have anything?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260473_0260541 We just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260848_0261428 Well, basically, not unless you've got time for it at the end.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0261428_0261548 Well, I...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263546_0263744 I think you would. How so?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263885_0264236 Rwy'n credu ei fod yn y canlyniad mwyaf gynhyrchol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0265828_0266434 No, but for things like if you search for language, then you might have some topics which have as a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0266434_0267224 Some meetings which have as a topic language, they specifically speak about language and they use that word in every sentence.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267224_0267660 And then you've got those that just mention it briefly like once or twice saying...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267660_0268069 my language is German or something stupid that you don't really want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268069_0268282 So you want to distinguish those somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268282_0268379 Or not, anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268695_0268792 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269326_0269623 For multiple turns we can just do something really simple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269623_0269691 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272028_0272402 Yeah, just... Yeah, so then just... Just as we go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272402_0272761 Yeah, I mean, you just do it really simply, you know?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272761_0273228 We'll have to talk to Pranil about this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0273228_0273333 We are using anatomy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274023_0274217 It doesn't have to be all intelligent.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274503_0274584 And it's the one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281142_0281256 But it's not that many meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281256_0281671 Iawn, ond mae yna 75 o weithiau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283154_0283256 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283612_0284081 It would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284081_0284542 but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284934_0285207 you still want to be able to search for the right language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285410_0285498 Yes, sir.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285850_0286022 We will discuss it again on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0002306_0002541 Mae'n sgwysio yn yma.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0005698_0005937 Het is geen muziekje voor zwaarder.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0009179_0009353 Dweud jyst yn y samgysedd jyst y tues.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0010398_0010516 So now we're getting it all.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017338_0017486 I wouldn't do it actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017486_0018262 Data processing is fine but I don't particularly want to do the GUI for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018262_0018397 No, not really.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018397_0019186 Iawn, dwi'n meddwl amdano.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019186_0019778 I've created two classes, one that represents speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019778_0020295 y cyfranogion, ac mae'r wybodaeth amdanyn nhw'n cael ei gynnwys yn unrhyw un o bwydau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020295_0020877 Ac yna, mae'n gwrthwynebu cyflogaethau, ac mae'r cyflogaethau yn cynnwys pob wybodaeth am y cyfarfodydd a'r sgwrs.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020877_0021528 Felly mae'r sgwrs sydd ar y cyfarfodydd, y cyfarfodydd sy'n sgwrs, ac yna'r cyfraithau sy'n cael eu cynnwys gyda'r sgwrs.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021528_0021812 Felly mae ddau gwasanaethau arbennig, os gwelwch chi'n ddiolch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021812_0021965 And they're two different objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021965_0022709 yna gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn dda, gallwch chi ddweud yn d
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0022709_0023131 ac yna gallwch chi ddweud methodau i'w gael yn ôl beth bynnag y byddwch chi eisiau. Iawn, ie, gweld beth yw'r beth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023131_0023532 neu pawb, ond dyna pam rwy'n gobeithio. Pa ffordd mwyaf haws i gael y data?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023891_0024199 Iawn, yn y bôn, mae'n rhaid i chi wneud hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024199_0024593 ac yn ymgyrchu'r obiectau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024593_0025389 Felly byddwch chi'n gofyn y nod a'r strwythur a'r llwyd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025463_0025733 and then we'll just go in one at a time to populate the window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025733_0026149 Ond dyna'r hyn rwyf eisiau ei ddweud, pa fformat y bydd y data'n dod yn ôl.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026149_0026783 because it can come back as... I'm not saying anymore.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026783_0026961 Le reste, c'était des sponsors.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0028239_0028328 Yeah, it can't cure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0029102_0030576 Felly, fel y gallwn ei wneud, mae'n rhoi'n ddiweddar i chi, yw ar hyn o bryd, mae'r adnoddau ddata sylfaenol ar ein cyfres cyfres ar gyfer y cyfarfodydd sy'n dweud, mae un o'r adnoddau yn cael ei gynnal yn ymwneud â chyfres, yw'r cyfres talc.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030576_0030860 1% yw'r nodau a 1% yw'r patient.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030860_0030913 to show me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030913_0031695 Ac yna mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae gennym ychydig, mae
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0031695_0032375 Gallwch ei gael yn y hashtag neu yn y vector a bydd yn dweud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032375_0032689 Mae'n un o striniau, gwirionedd, x%
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032689_0032977 We'll say a vector is cool. I don't know where but
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032977_0033810 gallwch gael eitha'n eithaf arferedig o strwythau a phob un yn cyflawni unig person neu beth bynnag.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0033810_0034240 What the easiest thing to do?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0034640_0034795 Yeah, you get it all the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0035962_0036317 هذا هو الطريق. كيف يمكنني أن أعيش معه مرة أخرى؟
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0036622_0037082 Mae'n ddifrifol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037082_0037710 Yn ysgrifennol, yw'r peth cyflawniol. Ie. Ie. Ie. Ie. Ie. Ie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037768_0038191 Felly, mae'r holl hyn wedi'i gysylltu hefyd, yn ystod y sbriciau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038191_0038361 Yeah, that's easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038361_0038476 So I'm gonna go out and meet some new people.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038476_0038941 the influences. I lived in Germany for six months, don't know if that had any effect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038941_0039137 Dwi'n mynd i ddod i'r brifysgrif.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039137_0039381 That was super salty.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039381_0039876 Go ahead and speak with the camera.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039876_0040167 Felly mae'r rhai hwn wedi'u cyfrif.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040167_0040336 worth to do is get the dialogue out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040336_0040428 на датиные публики.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041434_0041734 So then, how is this box populated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041734_0041973 Is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042237_0042339 You are impressive.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042950_0043546 oherwydd ar y moment rydw i'n defnyddio, mae methodau sy'n dweud, i'r ffyrdd rydw i'n defnyddio ar gyfer arall ffyrdd o'r gwasanaethau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0043546_0044062 So it's like get, get talk time and you text a name.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044062_0044474 So that we call that and call the meetings method that's it return them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044474_0044823 a'r rhai sy'n popu'r ffordd hwnnw, sy'n beth yn eisiau i mi.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044823_0045043 I mean that would
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046352_0046390 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046899_0047044 Yeah, yeah, that would be easy as well, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047199_0047239 Yeah, OK.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047239_0047777 Felly byddwn i'n rhoi llawer o ffyrdd sy'n dod yn ôl un nifer ar un gyfer.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047777_0048030 Dyna'r gwaith mwyaf'n haws i'w wneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048030_0048200 Okay. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048700_0048948 Iawn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049571_0049713 No, it still is an object file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049713_0050140 And then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050140_0050561 So it's all just pre-processed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050561_0050671 years of great process.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050671_0050993 Ac yna mae'n dweud bod obiectau yn rhaid i mi gael methodau'n dod yn ôl.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050993_0051116 It's just a great career at the OJ.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051116_0051305 It's called the Loeb Method.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051305_0051769 Felly yr hyn rydych chi'n ei wneud yw'n ei gynnal yn y constructor, achos os ydych chi'n ei gynnal yn y constructor cyffredinol ar gyfer pob cyfarfodydd,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051769_0052052 Mae'n dweud bod yr unig fath sy'n gynhyrchu'r un object yn y gweithgaredd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052052_0052355 and then if you call a null constructor.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052355_0052804 yna gallwch chi ddweud lle. Gallwch chi ddweud lle ar y C1 neu ar yr holl un neu rhywbeth fel hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052804_0052879 Это жесть.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053397_0053633 Bu çok iyi.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053683_0053812 不对 叶 叶
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053812_0053941 What if you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054355_0054561 It just tells you who participated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054561_0055144 Yn y moment, Natasha, pa mor bwynt y gynhyrchuoedd y gynhyrchuoedd? Yn perfformiadau. Ac yn amser hefyd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055391_0055574 Yeah, it'll be a lot easier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055903_0056071 Yeah, that's the time when you change it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056071_0056435 Felly dyna fydd yn cau broblem gyda pheth sydd ddim yn ymddangos ar y topïau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056752_0056795 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056795_0057141 Nid wyf, oherwydd roeddwn i'n cael fy nghyfres ar y dechrau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057141_0057373 There are some— There are some diva partners, actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057373_0057710 but people don't get discouraged.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0058924_0059029 Yeah, yeah, that would be a problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059029_0059346 And then you can do a search over the meetings, over the objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059346_0059579 Because that's the thing, these are so small.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059579_0060210 gallwch chi roi'r cyfan i gyd i ddod i mewn i'r brofiadau a phrofiadau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0060210_0060321 So it doesn't crash the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061027_0061353 Mae'r glans yn dod yn y fan hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061353_0061562 oherwydd maen nhw'n unig ar gyfer y ffynonellau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061822_0062225 The speaker class knows about all of that stuff. And the meeting class knows about that stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0062858_0063016 No, no, what the hell is he talking about?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063289_0063528 what we want to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063528_0063805 I thought the other stuff was more important anyway, so I did that first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064279_0064838 No, design the game first. The problem is if you change the classes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064838_0065272 The object serial numbers changing you can't reload the object so all the processing has to be done every game
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065272_0065398 and I haven't quite finished it yet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065605_0065949 it would become out of sync and get a bit funny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065949_0066289 If I gave you one. If I gave you it now and you worked on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066289_0066787 And then I changed it and run the thing and you wouldn't have been able to look at the object myself.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066787_0067293 ac yna byddwch chi'n cael ddau gofi o ddeunydd yn y gweithdai a'n cael...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0067637_0068265 But if you want to make a picture, you can do that without anything. What do you mean a picture?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068265_0068459 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068459_0068569 Yeah, but it's not gonna change.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068569_0068860 Yeah, that's a good one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069110_0069420 It won't take very long to get it all finished up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069420_0069766 I think I'll need to have done all this stuff too first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069766_0069924 Because otherwise the objects wouldn't be the same.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0070656_0070793 That's on my own version.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071077_0071212 I'm not okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071212_0071434 Vai ser isso que está por aqui.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089041_0089444 ymlaen, dyma'r ffordd y byddwch chi'n gobeithio y byddwch chi'n dweud i mi pam y byddwch chi'n cael y pwynt.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089444_0090063 It's a bit dumb if you can fool it, if you load up 10 different engines simultaneously.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090063_0090305 You can do that. Fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090305_0090583 I can't do them if it thinks they're one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090583_0091142 because it's about the amount that each... you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it for you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091142_0091801 Ond os ydych chi'n mynd i mewn i mewn, mae'n dweud, iawn, oh, iawn, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi ddweud, rhaid i mi dweud, rhaid i mi dweud, rhaid i mi dweud, rhaid i mi dweud, rhaid i mi dweud, rhaid i mi dweud, rhaid i mi dweud, rhaid i mi dweud,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091801_0091884 ou seja, o gajo não...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091884_0092582 I told you, now the sticks are...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0092582_0093326 You said nice machine. I spent too much time on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094276_0094351 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094351_0094424 Okay, cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094645_0094693 They pop up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094693_0094753 It's difficult.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099083_0099438 It's an SD browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099438_0100082 Some speech and some music. It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0101925_0102381 Or a switchboard that comes on that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102381_0102717 Love me a meeting, love me a search, love me something else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102717_0102797 We're switching.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0105945_0106173 Stupid NFTs, so stupid.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106173_0106536 Mae angen i chi gael gwrthwynebiad yn y blwyddyn cyn i ni ddechrau gwneud y sefyllfa.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106774_0107296 The only thing you can search is a night object model at the end.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0107942_0108922 Yn ystod y dydd, gallwch ddefnyddio'r search gynhyrchol i ddod o hyd i llwyr o gydweithiau ac yna defnyddio un o'r rhain i llwydro'r search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0108922_0109064 По любо...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109368_0109743 It has to be an observation and even if you go and search the whole corpus from that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109743_0110080 but you have to have, it has to start with something for some bizarre reason.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110080_0110675 engine there's only one there's only one search method to the search engine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110675_0110886 The engine class only has one section.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0111483_0111596 Iawn, diolch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118131_0118293 Don't forget your own to-do list at Honeywell.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118293_0118486 Biri onu takabilir, birisi onu tutamaz
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0120372_0120433 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121092_0121255 But it gives one at a time anyway, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121255_0121388 because otherwise you'd crash the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0124992_0125139 It's not too slow though, I don't think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125139_0125328 It's not too bad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125328_0125523 I thought they'd know we have chain laws in Peru.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125936 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130214_0130271 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130271_0130817 ychwanegu'r stringiau i llawer o bobl, ac yna yn eich gweithio yn y pethau pan ydyn nhw'n eu gwneud, mae angen i ni ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130817_0130921 These are the notions.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132245_0132471 Did we think about...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132681_0132824 better names for the meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134197_0134354 I did it today.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134607_0134666 To the lips.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134666_0134793 Okay, that's a little problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134793_0134875 Мы сейчас сейчас...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135077_0135305 That's the working group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135332_0135852 I want to see the videos about Damon better, I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0136433_0136556 Okay, that's good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138033_0138314 So who would have the ideas?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138314_0138521 Diolch am wylio'r dyddiau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138521_0138764 document frequencies for each word.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139058_0139344 I wneud yr hyn y mae'r sgwip yn ei ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139344_0139509 to do the topping
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0140243_0140790 somebody's done the key so the idea of the DS already with me
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143073_0143304 How do you do an inverted valsedge without the TFID?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143503_0144032 I think you need to do that. It would have been like a live still.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144032_0144273 y cymaint sydd yn ymwneud â'r ddocumentau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144273_0145030 basically the amount the DF is the document frequencies the amount that each word occurs
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0145030_0146188 Mae'r amser o'r ffrecwensiau'n ymwneud â'r amser sy'n digwydd. Un o'r ffrecwensiau yw'r amser sy'n digwydd mewn bob ddocument ac yr un arall yw'r amser sy'n digwydd yn y bobl.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0146188_0146938 Felly, y mwyaf o ddiddordeb yn y mathau syniadol ar gyfer eu sgôr cyffredinol, y mwyaf gwybodaeth yw y mathau sy'n cyffredinol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147303_0147608 The point is you call across the call, and it's still tighter.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147937_0148548 plus y stoplist, felly dyna'r rhan fwyaf sydd yn cael ysgol eich gwirionedd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148743_0148810 face top
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148964_0149212 Bunch o gyfraithau. Bunch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149212_0149416 Iawn, diolch yn fawr iawn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149416_0149507 Keywords or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149507_0149838 What's the I in TF-IDF?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149838_0149964 inverse document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149964_0150187 the term figures in those documents.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0150429_0150823 I did do it once, I do have a Java class that does it for something, I don't know whether it will work.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0152722_0153001 Also keywords gives you an eye on a whole new type of search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153001_0153109 Keywords
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153109_0153454 Ond gall y cyfeiriadau a'r cyfeiriadau gweithredu fod yn y peth y maen nhw'n ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153454_0154048 Yn ystod hyn, byddwn yn siarad am gyfraith llaw. Pan fyddwch chi'n dweud y byddwn yn ymwneud â'r ymdrechion a'r topïau, byddwn yn siarad am y cyfraith llaw.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0154203_0154315 Ffodus. Tisoed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0155341_0156222 Dw i'n meddwl, efallai na fyddai cyfrifoldeb y gweledigaethau eu hunain yn ymwneud â'r cyfeiriadau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0156222_0157189 The easy bit is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole currencies in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157189_0157624 oherwydd dydyn ni ddim yn rhaid i chi gysylltu cyfansoddiad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157973_0158359 No, you can do search without TFIDF, you just can't rank the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0158970_0159494 No, no, no, that's not what the idea was in the first place, rank the results so that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160264_0160488 Yeah, but that won't slow it down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160488_0160600 Right, Kimmy, why you slow down?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161107_0161604 It still uses the metaphyll but it ranks the results by the amount of hyaluronate.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161604_0161818 Dwi'n meddwl bod hynny'n rhan o'i gilydd, ond ie, dydyn ni ddim yn meddwl.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162242_0162710 Na, dydyn ni ddim. Dweud beth, dim ond ystod yr anhygoel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162977_0163392 But yeah, I guess. If that's not perfect, don't worry about it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0163561_0163750 She's only going to do this if we've got time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164726_0164813 We'll just give you a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164813_0165282 That was the whole point. This is your top line, this is your bottom.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166295_0166492 That's it. That's how I formatted it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166492_0166721 Mae'r TFIDF yn ysgol gwybodaeth, dwi'n credu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0167959_0168230 It's not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0168416_0168525 Voila!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169308_0169412 That's a compelling argument.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169412_0169892 Sunny days.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169892_0170033 and I can add you to it here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170303_0170774 Yn ei ffurf mwyaf cyffredinol, byddai'n gwneud rhan arall ar unrhyw un, ar un cyfnod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170774_0171163 You could make it more complicated and make it there. Let's not make it more complicated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0171523_0171710 We were just looking for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172042_0172133 Well, that's way worse.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172133_0172283 And then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0173224_0174008 I guess you just do a sum of the individual TFIDF for each term returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174008_0174408 and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174408_0174774 ac y mwyaf, y mwyaf gwybodol yw'r term ar gyfer pob peth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174957_0175023 I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175023_0175228 It's probably crude anyway, it's just looking for an arm.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175414_0175908 It's all it's going to do is look for separate. Oh, then it's going to go into the NXT section.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175908_0176137 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176137_0176267 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176267_0176403 So yeah, that's the screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176403_0176608 Um
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177487_0177584 Great questions.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177584_0178053 Yeah, without doing any like, um, we're also like,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0178851_0179386 Yeah, that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179386_0179709 That's um... yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179709_0179940 But the idea is that gives you a uniformity score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179940_0180210 how you combine those is up to you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180210_0180351 I guess, definitely not Cinderella's attraction.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180351_0180980 If you were this there's a lot whole load about it in manning and shoots
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180980_0181393 They've got a whole chunk about, so just IR isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181393_0181581 I'm not really sick enough to mention it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181581_0181729 Mae gennym gyfle da.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181729_0181889 Maybe you haven't got it at some club, then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182495_0182581 미안해, 지혜야.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182581_0182878 I'm recording it to feed you guys.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0187627_0187906 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188687_0188748 Yeah, I guess I...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188748_0188875 I guess that's huge.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0197880_0198070 It can have the same preferences.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198070_0198284 You can have a safe trip to Sicily.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198795_0199338 Or I call it favourites.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199338_0199448 You can't have a fight right now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199722_0200105 Yeah, it's not enough animation. It's not like they come back every day and do the same thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0201502_0201561 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0204803_0204956 Yeah, it'll be quite good if it has, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0205719_0206009 That's not what I'm suggesting. I'm just saying, like, these are...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207456_0207592 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207592_0207657 Please.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208096_0208257 Yeah, research.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208257_0208441 So even if it's just that two things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208441_0208990 Ac roedd y cyfranogiadau yn dweud, rydw i'n dweud, dyna i'r cyfarfod hwn, a byddai text-box yn cael ei gynnal, a byddai'r cyfrifiadau yn dod i'r fenyw.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208990_0209204 And then another one that said search that loaded instantly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209204_0209467 I'd have research like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209594_0209856 Ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie, ie,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211013_0211248 The only thing to do is just have search as the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211248_0211482 Mae'n ddifrin ac mae'r sefydliad yn ddifrin.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211482_0211798 Ac mae hynny'r gweithdai. Yn mynd i mewn i mewn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212121_0212516 Yna mae'r brofysgwr yn dod o hyd i chi i gael ymchwil ar rai pethau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212516_0213348 or the search window could have on it something that said just as a drop-down menu that says just a go button that said take me to this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213348_0213571 So that's setting it. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213571_0214400 So the only thing that comes up when you finish is a, when you start, it's just one window like that. And it's got all the search stuff right down there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214400_0214615 So this is your search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214615_0215164 just all here and here is just go to wherever and the go button
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215164_0215514 Ac yna o hynny, mae'n cymryd i chi gael gweithio'n dda iawn. Ie, dyna'r... ie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215704_0216048 And at the top it says, welcome to our browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0216813_0216963 Dobra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217344_0217656 I know you wouldn't have. Well, we don't actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217831_0217942 Sam's a creep.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0218438_0218515 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219079_0219129 diyeceğim.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219733_0220248 Os ydych chi am ddysgu eich ddysgu, os ydych chi am edrych ar un cyfarfodydd, edrych arno.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220248_0220721 That's two.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220721_0221165 Un yw un yno, mae gennych ddau, un anhygoel, un yn ystod y flwyddyn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221165_0221415 and you can choose, you can go for a girl or go for the other.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221415_0221477 Go on, go for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221477_0221637 Nu, nu, nu!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0223369_0224053 We could do Microsoft's Day and hold it over it and it pops up I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224202_0224302 Is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224883_0225023 That's something to think about.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225023_0225259 Oh, I didn't see that there!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225832_0226409 Get out of the bloody way, I'm trying to test it out here!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227076_0227367 Yeah, that's true, that's a good one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227367_0227691 But that's why you could just have a list of your users then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227691_0227942 And just to say I wouldn't have looked for this user.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228029_0228112 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228112_0228471 Yn y blynyddoedd, mae'n cael ystyried y rhai sydd wedi cael y ddefnydd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228471_0228698 Sonra da
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228698_0229192 Maybe just leave it, just have them leave some names there and don't worry about the speakers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229192_0229367 They're doing speakers, they're doing such.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229367_0229594 It's not the sound, it's doing the quick accents.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230146_0230659 Wel, gallwch gael llyfr yma. Ie, rwy'n meddwl bod yna newidiadau. Ie, pan fyddwch chi'n mynd ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230659_0230821 Then that doesn't get in between the kid and the wife.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0232469_0232617 the full name and then speak it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233013_0233294 We can do all of that without even having to go anywhere near loading up the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233465_0233505 I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233723_0233769 and cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233769_0233929 I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233929_0234025 for meeting and all.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0234538_0234956 dwi'n meddwl y byddai'n model o ddeunydd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235175_0235508 Yeah, it's the right covers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235508_0235796 The Knight-Rite Corpus and then you've got Knight-Rite Elements for this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235796_0236117 You've got lots of numbs on you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0236408_0237040 I think the N ones are interfaces and the night one, one of the ways around, one's an interface and one's actually an implemented class.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237040_0237498 Because you go back enough, I think I'm the what's-his-name
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237498_0237773 The API is all right, but there's not a lot of description in it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237773_0237959 It's very cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237959_0238103 Says you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239098_0239480 So yeah, no, just to say it returns a M text box.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239480_0239560 So again, what's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239583_0240106 It's an implementation of an N text... Yeah. ...interface.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240106_0240169 What's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240169_0241198 I would say extended version of it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0242760_0242869 Might be useful, wouldn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0243694_0243809 Yeah, I should have moved to the left.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0244908_0245011 Oh, we can just...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246177_0246362 Just after.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246973_0247021 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247021_0247144 So that means to write.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247460_0247646 You didn't forget one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247646_0247742 Yeah, that could be fun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248492_0248785 Friday morning.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248940_0248994 Thanks, everybody.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249148_0249215 화이팅!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249215_0249491 Maybe, I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0250517_0250815 So we say it correctly often then if there's a serious road marker.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252439_0252628 Sbon am y tygrif hwnna dwi'n mynd i'w ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252792_0252904 I freaked out at the final scene.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253216_0253648 It's just straight side, side, straight, go. And then, if there's a problem with that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253648_0254165 then his 3 across the problem 5 or 6 will be a problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254165_0254342 I don't think that will be no solution.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254982_0255215 Is she collecting them? No!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255215_0255501 You just sent me a text. Because she's not here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255501_0255898 I'm eating the chocolate too. Oh, you're right! Oh, yeah, sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256003_0256253 I give a let to meeting some people.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256327_0256480 I thought somebody was correcting them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256480_0256648 But that's what I thought we were doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256898_0257262 We know who's missed them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268426_0268832 Yeah, that would help. For single terms it would be very useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268832_0269419 for multiple terms unless you want to do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0269767_0270631 Or you could do it and override it by the... You could just ignore the ranking if it doesn't show up together. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0270631_0270975 Or you could penalize it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271207_0271446 Yeah, you do the NXT shirt so it doesn't show up together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271446_0271683 either disregard it or put a weight on you against it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271683_0271921 So how many pairs you get wouldn't show up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272131_0272336 Yeah, so then just push next.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272981_0273098 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274286_0274539 Some things you're gonna get a lot of results
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274539_0274873 And if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom, then it was actually the most relevant one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274873_0275008 Something that I was also...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276454_0276627 Iawn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276627_0277014 And um... Also, if there's something like Sunny Day...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277014_0277640 the if sunny and day aren't mentioned together a lot but it's only two versions once
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277640_0277942 that its term will be low it will push down the other one if you combine them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277942_0278075 if you stick the card together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279124_0279167 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279167_0279738 but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something's an amazing highly ranked thing from the TFIVF
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279738_0280798 Yn ystod y cyfrifiadau, a oes modd i'r cyfrifiadau ddweud nad yw'n bwysig, gallai'n ddweud nad yw'n bwysig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281067_0281627 Ond nid yw'r cyfansoddau hynny. Ond mae yna 75 o gyfansoddau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281627_0281677 Yeah, you suck.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281996_0282399 Felly ie, os ydych chi wedi dod yn ôl i 75, pa mor ffordd ydych chi'n parhau?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282399_0282559 How do you write them? Or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282559_0283107 If it says 20, even if it says 20, do you cut it for 10? Do you rank them? Do you? No, it's true. Okay. What's the threshold?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283107_0283196 for you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283425_0283566 Dat is helemaal mooi.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283566_0283669 It would be useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287489_0287536 Is that it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287733_0287945 Jadå.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0288070_0288203 It's my authority.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0004764_0005099 Comments?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0005099_0005160 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0006711_0006820 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0010769_0011623 One thing that I was wondering, is there a standard control that you use to connect the different things?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0011623_0012020 like you're in the topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012020_0012646 Is there a particular type of control that like is one of these NXT or sorry night controls?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012646_0012722 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0015854_0016228 You haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016228_0016669 like other topics where we're going to do it for speaker I guess.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016669_0016708 right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016779_0017338 Okay. When we talk about speaker characterization, how are we accessing the list of speakers?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026808_0026979 I'm just going to stick this one down my nose.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026979_0027329 like when he was talking about like having architecture that things are going to plug into.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027329_0027798 I mean, so the things are all modular. I mean, it would be good if we use that same idea for anything else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027798_0027954 What else are we doing?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027954_0028342 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0028342_0028849 I mean search results are for all in a predictable thing with a name, certain properties or a list of properties.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0033745_0033849 Whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034053_0034342 How do you want to do this play?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034378_0034788 It's just a matter of deciding what would be easiest all the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049224_0049723 So each time you're going straight to the XML files for the information? No, it's stored as an object file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049723_0049757 process
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049757_0049850 I'm not offline.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049850_0049965 It was a nice day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049965_0050004 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050258_0050422 Rwy'n gobeithio fy mod i'n gael 1,000 o ffrindiau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050422_0050663 So that's all just pre-processed? Yeah, just pre-processed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051309_0051345 So what you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051959_0052044 Right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0052811_0053116 Is it for the entire corpus?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053116_0053476 Or is it just like individual ones, like one object for each?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053476_0053540 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053540_0053686 Aynen, biçim ekip.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053919_0054132 I wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054132_0054324 Boop.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054355_0054385 It's just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054871_0054911 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0056609_0057022 or just return a null or a blank or... No, because I'll speak specifically to you at the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0060208_0060258 Das ist das
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071484_0071909 Actually I can upload myself as well, I just have to make one change to your phone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071909_0072240 just to load this one instead of the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0072240_0072566 So, it's too much cool. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073070_0073163 Um, what do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073336_0073698 Well, yeah, just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074114_0074311 Well, your version.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074427_0074693 I did it in my directory. Oh, okay. So not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074876_0075176 I have a copy. Yes. Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075176_0075245 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075245_0075906 but I will yeah I was going to update that one just yeah it just makes sense that well just just tell me when because I usually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076114_0076300 Right, yeah. And then update.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076547_0076744 Yeah, I haven't made any changes to it yet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076744_0076902 It's okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076902_0077102 I'll just pick that one on the channel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077311_0077597 Fel y dywedais i, mae'n ddiddorol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077597_0078132 And then you can play.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078132_0078233 There's not much to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078233_0078625 Have to get better results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078938_0079543 And just to wire in the topics and do our summaries.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0079543_0080115 I mean, they have highlighting stuff. Well, yeah, I like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080115_0080211 soon.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080297_0080874 and just want to find what kind of objects those were for the other ones.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080874_0081304 o'r rhai a oedd yn mynd i mewn i'r hamser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0082326_0082359 about this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085593_0085681 Okay, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085892_0086548 Index
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086548_0086820 So, I think that's gonna be kind of fun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086820_0087170 I'm just wondering if you had to, well the way you're doing, I was gonna ask if the way you were doing it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087170_0087588 You were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting, but you're doing the objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087588_0088289 So you don't need to just because if we if we do have like the inverted search says that there's young
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0088289_0089001 10 documents or we're going to have to load each of these 10 corporal just to do the individual next research.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0089380_0089533 Probably.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090150_0090373 Fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090373_0090406 I'll leave them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090860_0091294 You have to call a new class and then it will do it fine, but if you don't...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091294_0091408 Johnson's.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091738_0092049 Otherwise you guys all know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0093795_0093898 So that ain't that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099112_0099725 It's an ASD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099725_0099959 Oh my god.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099959_0100154 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100154_0100590 We have to, while we're debugging.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100590_0100987 But it was something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103440_0103544 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103783_0103949 Because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104515_0104905 I was just going to ask if we should assume that they'll want to load a meeting first, but not necessarily.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104905_0105239 I guess if you're doing a search on the entire. Yeah, I mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0105765_0105892 And to that, we'll go to the next slide.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0106555_0106792 Well, we can. Does it? Oh!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107270_0107714 I think you probably even, that shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107714_0107884 And if it hasn't loaded, then force it to load.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111723_0111938 Unless they know what meeting it is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111938_0112083 واو
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0113546_0114127 Well, the things that may just be looking for work, and it shows up at 10 different meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114127_0114868 And at that point, they'll probably want to like do we want to like if it by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returning.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114868_0114978 Go through.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115184_0115431 Well, I'd like to order like the thing is, I think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115580_0116003 Like when it loads up, it'll load up the transcript window and whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116003_0116206 Right now I think just the topic ones.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116206_0116826 Although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116826_0117456 So I'm just thinking if it's kind of like you're saying you have to have a normal object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117456_0117835 I mean, before you do, you search it all. Yeah, the local search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117876_0117953 candle levels.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117953_0118007 Koş.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118453_0118825 Yeah, but the global one feeds into the local.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118825_0119318 So if we're getting any useful data, it's going to be doing a search on each of those files.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0119318_0119664 So it's going to be loading up each of those at a time to get the data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0120470_0120896 But it can be time consuming if there are 10 documents that everyone's using.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121424_0121743 Um, yeah, just thinking of some way we could, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121743_0122317 I'll just cache the results in a nice little format that'll make things a bit easier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0122317_0123043 But the thing is, I mean, if we've got that, then it's going to be needing really to load the entire corpus for that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123043_0123539 if it's trying to show us where those were, if it's trying to highlight those in the text, transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123539_0123775 And we're going to have to have all that other data in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123775_0124048 So each time we have a search window in the app, like, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124048_0124307 10 different meetings, the word wireless comes up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124307_0124688 Go to meeting one and ask it. Reload the non-object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124688_0124836 Next one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124836_0125272 Ie, nid yw'n ddiflannu'n dda iawn, dwi'n meddwl.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125272_0125338 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125539_0126076 It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126076_0126392 Test it, trust your intuition. Shut down, order it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126392_0126975 So just sort of based on that as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126975_0127464 But if it doesn't take that long, you should know how much. All right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0128741_0128774 Jones.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0129973_0130006 It's all about the money.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0130824_0131060 one of these three notions.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131060_0131406 And that way if they know specifically which meaning it is, they'll save the time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131406_0131880 Because I'm sure they don't want to have the extra loading time either if they can avoid it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131880_0132180 So yeah, or they can check them out against the ones they want to check.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0132988_0133108 I think they were in the text.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0133108_0133838 We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of be DB you don't just do there is. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134088_0134278 I did it today
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134278_0134441 I'm just standing all wet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134441_0134649 Like the working group that it's part of.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134767_0134902 I probably just use that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135309_0135394 Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135999_0136107 That's accurate.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0138712_0139019 Do I actually need the frequencies?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139480_0139554 Oh, right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139574_0139634 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140160_0140436 Well, the thing is if it's being done... If somebody's done the keywords...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140755_0141096 There's a class she's trying to get to work on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141096_0141729 They did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141729_0142205 But it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff, but at last I heard it wasn't working.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142205_0142825 She was going to look at a more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142825_0143125 But if we need the, if we do need the frequencies.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143368_0143467 아...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143784_0144054 It would have been like a lifestyle.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0144389_0144452 What's it stand for?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147353_0147533 Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147533_0147825 I'm going to.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147825_0148187 Plas y stoplis, felly dyna'r peth a ddod allan.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0149632_0149922 What's the I in TF-IDF?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0150668_0150690 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158468_0158525 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158525_0158712 Yeah, that's why I'm doing it too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158712_0159014 No
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0159014_0159111 That's what was
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0161982_0162591 I don't think we have that in the document. True. No, we didn't. True. So what? It's only intimate.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162649_0162718 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162718_0162746 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0163504_0163648 Yeah, nice to meet you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0164960_0165013 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165013_0165350 This is your top one, this is your bottom.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165350_0165897 But the thing is, we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting, if they're looking for a particular term or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165897_0166317 They just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and I want to see it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0167571_0168186 If it's like a two-word term, does a TF-IDF have a link?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168186_0168529 It's not a compound noun, it's just two words together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168529_0168814 Um, and I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168814_0168924 Kind of.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168924_0169280 to something like Edinburgh University.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169446_0169675 Well, I guess that's it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169675_0169803 Sunny days.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169803_0169843 Still doing good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0170922_0171222 It's not making more sense.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171385_0171739 Because the thing is, the thing is that the way we were doing it, we were just looking for the words.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171739_0172055 period each word in the index.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172055_0172193 That's way we're thinking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172193_0172508 And then it's just saying, were these two words in any of these documents?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172508_0173238 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0175914_0176170 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176170_0176242 That's the best.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176617_0176931 I'm just wondering if it's going to give us something cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176931_0177652 If it's sort of like if the NXT search is still got to be run to find these terms or these groups. Yeah, without
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0177957_0178333 Or also, like, do wild cards work for something like that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178333_0178889 So if you're looking for wireless wired wire, blah blah blah, you can do wire with a star.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178889_0179192 Actually, that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179192_0179324 So, of course.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179324_0179364 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179683_0179870 The idea is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180329_0180467 Just try it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180467_0180583 Okay, I don't understand.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180583_0180653 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181036_0181057 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181454_0181530 pantry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181880_0182342 Yeah, I've got somewhere. PDF.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182591_0182876 Other than it's a big ass bitch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182876_0183163 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183580_0183640 Ugh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183640_0183894 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0184522_0184819 Oh, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0186835_0186923 for me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0187258_0187797 For the most part. I mean there will be a set of people.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188405_0188759 search for stuff or start working. Yeah I guess I
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188759_0189152 I guess that's huge.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189349_0189594 Like if you're looking for something specific, is that what you're thinking?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189594_0190013 Like if they if they know exactly where they want to go they want to go to you know that meeting on December 3rd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190401 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0191972_0192304 Browse by meeting, browse by mom, browse by speaker.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192304_0192679 No, I'm just thinking of different ways we can do that, like different buttons on the top.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192679_0193086 Like if they're looking for a particular person, particular working group, particular whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193086_0193671 We could break things down like that, to that level of detail if we want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193671_0193905 where we could get more general.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195177_0195627 Yeah, but I'm just thinking like initially when they load up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195627_0195904 what are the range of things that they'd want to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195904_0196265 Like if they're part of X working group, the one that came out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196265_0196481 Do we want to save preferences?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196786_0197287 Well, if they're part of BDB working group, they're going to want to look at the BDB ones and some default to that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197287_0197384 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197610_0198058 based on what they did the last time. They can have the same preferences.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199005_0199280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199424_0199910 Okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200239_0200457 он сейчас будет улыбаться
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200457_0200585 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200585_0200849 I forgot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200922_0201065 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201065_0201541 Well, no, I'm just getting back to sort of what could be on the startup screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201541_0201912 Like there's just a range of things we could do. We could have like search options, browse options.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201912_0202445 I don't know, just playing around with ideas.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0202445_0203527 And then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks. Well, if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203527_0203630 Angeles, Colorado.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203630_0203968 Mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n d
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203968_0204271 It's just like, hey, my task is to do this, and there's a button for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204271_0204383 Perfect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204383_0204496 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204496_0204529 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204529_0204737 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205682_0205884 No, that's not what I'm suggesting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205884_0206558 So I'm just saying like these are just like a lot of programs will kind of blame programs do have that sort of thing first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0206558_0207407 just because they don't want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves. And just like do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the program.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207407_0207598 좋아
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207992_0208211 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209137_0209471 I just instantly, I just search, like, find specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209471_0209691 Yeah, that's an interesting point.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0210971_0211077 Such as cruelty.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217577_0217753 We don't actually have usernames, do we?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217753_0218050 We don't have to go through all these codes and send these things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218519_0218657 In a case like that, we do want to talk to them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218657_0218789 We don't want them to type them, do we?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219359_0219525 and allow multiple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219563_0219865 Okay, you're just looking for one specific.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0221052_0221142 amazing ones.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0224492_0224581 It's a lot of work.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0227069_0227251 Yeah, that's true, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230548_0230731 You go over there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230731_0230930 Yeah, maybe that's the best idea then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234609_0234815 Yok.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234815_0235146 I think in that case it's the right corpus.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235146_0235208 So goodnight.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235208_0235417 Yeah, it is, you're right, it's the right covers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0236358_0236513 Yeah, I think we end once.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0239953_0240051 I'm gonna go get a drink.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240638_0240914 I
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240914_0240980 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0241644_0241921 I'm really just going to keep on going.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0242621_0243025 Might be useful in Friday afternoons.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0243877_0244106 Then we won't have to have the meeting with Steve on Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244106_0244159 fertile.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244241_0244628 Do we want to get this one earlier?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244628_0244888 Three.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245098_0245167 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245587_0245678 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246596_0246706 Possibly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246706_0246996 Usually by then. Need a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246996_0247596 I don't know, because it's the lab and trying to get some work done.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248060_0248216 Okay, right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248216_0248298 And...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248688_0248940 3 o'clock?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248940_0249187 Or you want to get
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249187_0249353 Maybe I do I'm not sure
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249353_0249436 I think that's a good one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249767_0249998 I think she's got a class at 11.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249998_0250371 with all that class 12.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250371_0250565 How about suicide?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250776_0250894 I think we could try one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250894_0251001 We could try shortly after.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251001_0251148 Yeah, well yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251148_0251339 Well, it wouldn't be a long meeting then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251339_0251379 Please.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251379_0251707 Would you want to? No, probably not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251707_0251921 If one's bad for you, then the other one's not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252235_0252278 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252855_0252933 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259469_0259873 There's just sort of the basic implementation stuff that I was really involved with.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259873_0260094 Baktım. Evet, şu defa.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260094_0260376 It's just a good person.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260376_0260692 Did we decide whether it should be ranked?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260798_0260979 It will.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0261426_0262136 Well, I kind of think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262136_0262837 Just because it is like independently doing the words for particular documents it's not it's not really getting them together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262837_0263091 Like if someone's looking for a particular journal.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263091_0263526 I don't know. Just don't know if it would bring us that much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263668_0263708 Awesome.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264093_0264561 If they're looking for, like I said, a sunny day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264561_0264931 Sunny shows up in this document, they show up with their map together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264931_0265179 Or if there are two.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0265179_0265811 It just doesn't you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0268462_0268812 For single, for single terms it would be very easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0269500_0269766 I mean, you could just do something really simple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270757_0270985 You could penalize it, you could just put a blank.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270985_0271210 just still do the NXT shirt trend.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271210_0271367 Yeah, you do the NXT shirt, so it doesn't show.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271367_0271506 together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271599_0271853 waiting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271853_0272207 I wouldn't show up on the search results if it didn't exist.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0272813_0273225 We'll have to talk to Pranil about this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0273225_0273883 We are using that. I mean, it does make sense for that, but actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274305_0274557 Some things you're gonna get a lot of results for.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274879_0275247 I mean if it's my own... yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275247_0275434 Yeah, okay, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275434_0275852 I think we could actually put that like on the list of meetings that get returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275852_0276514 if there are 15 meetings languages in it's going to show you thumbs and rank them as to which is the highest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0276514_0276625 It's okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278040_0278313 The things I mean, that'll be exactly how we're doing it now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278313_0278617 Like we're just looking for the two words separately and see if they exist in the same document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278617_0278907 and if they do, then there's a possibility that they occurred together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278907_0279111 and then we do the anoxy-script on that document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0279318_0279373 moment.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280821_0280998 We'll break down and start doing anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280998_0281269 I don't know what we used to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281269_0281344 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281344_0281597 But there are 75 meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281597_0281750 Yeah, he said. Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0282891_0282954 Now it's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0283224_0283732 Het zou ook wel handig zijn voor een
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0287628_0287707 Yep.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0002063_0002511 It's okay, every time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0004128_0004707 çok güzel
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0006734_0007677 I'm going to have fun dropping the shoes. You're not going to get to see most. Yeah, most. It's not as big as I have. Seems slippery. That's what it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0007677_0008425 Maybe I can set it here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0008425_0008509 Are they on yet?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0011420_0012024 Was that a joke? No, that's just someone. No. No?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012024_0012207 What?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012207_0012328 Oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019391_0019703 I'm so sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019703_0020121 I'm gonna get these tears.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0021504_0021700 I think I'm...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0024953_0025451 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0026983_0027218 Should have run in the aisle.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0028081_0028133 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0033434_0033643 That's it.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0069261_0070287 Forgive me. Yeah. It's taking me to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0084666_0084871 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087192_0087460 They have a big yellow in there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087460_0088218 What have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0088236_0089082 Yeah.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0101446_0102253 I'm running some troubles with the in-between but found another package instead of writing it from scratch.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0102253_0102750 because I don't know. Just know that I haven't put on it much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0103034_0103425 We'll see what happens in the next few days.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0104085_0104232 Well, it's very...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0105967_0106108 I think it's a true editor.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108083_0108360 I didn't expect this crispy so much, but duh.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108360_0109058 Yeah, that's right. It's a job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0109058_0109200 Practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0114513_0115039 I thought we said... I thought we changed it to the 10th or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0115201_0115311 It's not.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120108_0120189 That was so wild.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120308_0120594 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120594_0120764 And that would give us the whole time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121032_0121596 I've got my genealogy presentation on Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121596_0121866 It's too much now.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0126447_0126523 Well, sort of.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0127211_0128210 The thing is, because we're going to get an email on our MSC, this is too unproceeding. We're looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0129220_0129630 Well, they're gonna use spreading
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0129630_0130067 I didn't know that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0130067_0130510 It's not going to take long. It's only going to be high amount.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0130510_0130868 We need to lose each other.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154016_0154252 I'm planning to have a party on the 21st.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154557_0154768 End of lectures.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0155606_0155728 Oh, it's actually 24.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160131_0160714 Did he say anything about what he expects of the final report?

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162302_0162513 Although it's
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162725_0162808 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0163258_0164252 We have interim report of 7 pages and that's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164252_0164518 We could probably just expand that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164660_0164909 I mean, a lot of it's going to be the same thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165229_0165633 And then I mean, right about the evaluation. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165633_0165800 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165915_0166112 I don't think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166261_0166473 I'm actually just gonna do it.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0198555_0199395 It should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries from using that text extractor thingy around right?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0199631_0199794 I get a skewed top of this chair.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200307_0200435 Thank you.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0012734_0013051 Have you changed the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013694_0013806 Yeah, I forgot that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013999_0014535 No, when you said at the beginning I thought, must check the red light in the...

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0019388_0019671 It's like a party.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020309_0020675 There is a file in the directory called disform.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020863_0020953 I was.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022810_0022869 Anyways.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023621_0024047 Yeah, that was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025012_0025312 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025312_0025661 I don't know if they live there but they don't have even more stuff there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0026400_0026858 What did you actually do? Oh, it's huge.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0027366_0027487 That's a lot.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028244_0028456 Has anyone had time to play with it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028841_0028914 in the comments.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0030210_0030251 You want to keep
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031013_0031119 Might as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031119_0031314 It doesn't really do anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031314_0031602 The thing is that yeah, there is, as I said a while ago
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031602_0032314 there is still this one error which is always generates these
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032314_0032693 I think when you left click or right click or something, I can't remember now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032835_0033593 But if it's a real error then it stops. Yeah, I didn't discover any of those.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035556_0035682 Yeah, that would be good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035682_0036229 Is there any comments you have about just like wording or some sort of minor things?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0036931_0037073 A lot of this jealousy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037073_0037439 At the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty tall.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037439_0038026 Ond ie, byddai'n dweud iddyn nhw'n dda iawn os oedd yn cael mwy o amser yn well na'r byddai'n edrych fel hyn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0038026_0038251 No, it's not, it's not, it's not, not at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0039715_0040133 That took me so long to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040229_0040610 So I'm quite glad that it looks nice on one row.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040826_0040967 No, this is just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043111_0043280 That's... awesome.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043872_0044186 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0044186_0045922 I've done something like that before. It's insane. Really speed it up. Try that if you're into this. Yeah, I started using your, um, the speaker. I don't know if you've seen that. I saw that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046694_0046770 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046770_0046985 But it's good, your stuff is really good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046985_0047241 It's got a good interface and easy to use.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0047241_0047277 Nice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050087_0050345 So I'll go to that and then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050983_0051183 Zu immer Seiten.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051521_0051791 It's kind of boring.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051791_0051870 It's very
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0052391_0052733 Sleep on it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0053528_0054020 So which, you know, maybe you can suggest a few that would be interesting to list.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054020_0054141 like figures.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054999_0055042 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059149_0059684 I mean, do we care? I don't know. It doesn't really matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059782_0060580 But it would be difficult if in the speaker characterization window we had a heading, you know, top five dialogue acts.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0060580_0061211 and then the little brackets but they're not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0062130_0062233 I'r sgrinwyr.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063316_0063513 No, I wouldn't...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063921_0064001 when it comes up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064597_0064749 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064997_0065404 yeah just do top five both local and global and then have another
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0065511_0066137 but then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0067354_0067828 You fall out of the sofa.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068535_0068751 Yeah, and that's what's big in Calculation Gizmo.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068933_0068999 Please, Lord, more.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0070291_0071373 So, is this percentage then, if you say like, Joke for this speaker is percentage,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0071373_0072234 I don't know, 20? Is that the... what percentage of his speech is joke? What percentage of the joke?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0072390_0072533 Yes.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081701_0081788 Oh.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0083604_0084156 I have one little question that I reckon we should have a little icon for our browser.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084458_0084804 Well no, I think it was the top left.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084804_0085504 Yn y moment maen nhw wedi cael un X sy'n NXT ac mae'n ddiddorol iawn i ddefnyddio hynny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0085748_0086228 Nooo, I want something original.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086228_0086606 What do you suggest?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086606_0086931 The only thing not kissing was an M.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0087488_0088107 What have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089655_0089703 It's mutual.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089864_0090401 Mae'n ddin, felly dydyn ni ddim yn gallu rhoi mwy na un ffynonell.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0090996_0091065 Bir de
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092316_0092511 Wel, os gwelwch unrhyw beth, ysgrifennwch iddo i mi.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092623_0092786 Otherwise I'll make up something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093222_0093399 I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093399_0093461 It's really easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094007_0094383 Yeah, I know how to put it there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094383_0094598 Okay. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094598_0094669 I want what you want.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094912_0095078 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0096698_0096891 Oh yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0097278_0097652 Welcome to the meeting. Can we get sound on these machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0098936_0099810 if the sound card is registered to your name, which it usually is not, and you have to reboot.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0109184_0109734 In fact it's an NXT package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110371_0110848 I mean sometimes I have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110848_0111427 I think it was... It's the way it does.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0114594_0114697 I thought we said...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116565_0116699 Like a G.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116932_0117417 Well, that's the problem because Steve hasn't given us any details.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118045_0118119 That's rude.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118486_0118681 I'm sure we could do that in a meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118798_0118957 Just brainstorm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119308_0119597 The thing is, yeah, we had the deadline last Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119597_0120310 But we won't be able to do any evaluation during the weekend anyway. So I think we could set Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0120589_0120727 And that would give us the whole answer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124504_0124539 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124539_0124631 I think that's fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125696_0125814 Exactly, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125814_0126195 At the end we'll say, well you never gave us any tests or things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126439_0126709 Well, sort of, that's how I understand it. He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126709_0126933 He would make something up. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126933_0127272 Yeah, find some people. That's how I used to do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0127272_0127400 잘생겨지네
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0128207_0129005 I think if we don't get anything from him, then we should just do our friends basically.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0129539_0129786 Well, they are spreading so they should...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130084_0130181 It's not gonna take long.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130181_0130389 It's only gonna be hot now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0131849_0132005 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132005_0132102 Only movie.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132203_0132302 I have to be here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0133368_0133554 I was thinking of like 10.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135493_0135700 How can you get a range of people if you have three?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135848_0136057 What else do we have?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137042_0137183 They should just have two.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137207_0137686 I'm like, that wasn't good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0138306_0139183 Another thing, we have the presentation in one and a half weeks or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139183_0139283 Nearly two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139470_0139766 Oh it is true, yeah it is two weeks then.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139766_0140033 Do we have to have done the evaluation by then?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141001_0141075 I understand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141075_0141211 That was so sick.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141211_0141299 Yeah, that's good advice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141791_0141925 It's not Good Friday!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0142694_0142974 Well, I'm sure on the website it says the same thing. Yeah, OK.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0143656_0144109 Well, you know, the question is, do we need the evaluation for the presentation?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144673_0144807 We should definitely ask him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144807_0144937 Because if not, then...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0146055_0146174 Yeah, you might be right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0147522_0147750 Because we need a writer presentation as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148526_0148668 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148668_0148771 That's insane.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0149119_0149585 Wel, dwi ddim yn gredeg ar ôl y diwrnod hon ond dwi'n gredeg ar ôl.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0150257_0150782 I mean I'm not going to. Because I don't have anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0151069_0151276 That's the inner meaty
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0152163_0152341 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0155338_0155536 I don't fancy writing them an email.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0156342_0156473 Да.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157162_0157354 But it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157354_0157436 as a part of the.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157584_0157793 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157793_0158247 Rydyn ni'n ganddo'r wybodaeth i'r cyfarfod.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158247_0158353 And...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158660_0158735 What was the other one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158872_0159599 Yn y bôn, sut mae'r cyfrifiadau chi'n mynd?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0159599_0160018 Have you got people you had first, what is it and when?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0161530_0161870 Did we know, did he ever say how long it was supposed to be?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162181_0162365 Tschüss.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162784_0162869 But we can write a lot.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162869_0163120 I think we should write everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0164008_0164164 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0165590_0165676 Yeah, I was going to say.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0166237_0166299 Actually, just.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167052_0167284 So, do you want to write him an email then? Sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167284_0167326 Let me get to that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167850_0168296 and when I get home today which will be before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0168622_0169192 Before half past six I will make that file readable, writable and everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169318_0169404 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169404_0169517 Well, I will...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169906_0170600 Well, I will need your snippets of code, or it would be good if I had them by tomorrow evening.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0170935_0171105 I was gonna ask...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171289_0171434 at the moment your search window.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171565_0171657 How's it organised?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172507_0172809 But at the beginning, when you haven't searched yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172809_0173357 Yn y pen draw, yw'n ymddangos yn ddau, ac mae'r ddŵr hwn yn unig?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0173882_0174181 And then if you, I don't know, double click on one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0175887_0175963 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0176802_0177381 What? This is the icon by the way. Yeah, I know. Beautiful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0177559_0178451 Yeah, maybe you want to do left-handed. Yeah, one left click highlights the result in whatever you've got open.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178805_0178847 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178969_0179185 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0179185_0179812 Usually one left click it highlights it, cross highlights everything. I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181008_0181185 I don't know why it's difficult because...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181679_0181767 Oyunculuk harçtı.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182347_0182533 No, it's difficult.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182533_0182797 because the transcription window does cross highlighting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182924_0183290 in a very awkward way because he has to find the topic first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183290_0183584 That was a pain.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183744_0184682 and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0184682_0185363 and that works when you left double click on a topic, on a meeting sorry, then it loads it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185470_0185530 So you can.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185645_0185769 You could take that for learning.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185971_0186525 So if we have that the same on this one, at least that you, if you double left click that loads.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187847_0187994 highlights, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187994_0188550 I mean obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here, but also highlights
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0188848_0188969 She's difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0189484_0190231 Because you only ever have one meeting open and those resorts won't be open. Well, I suppose if you have a local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190231_0190333 Then you could cross eye line.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190932_0191506 Oherwydd os ydych chi'n dod yn ôl ar nifer o gyfresau gwahanol yma, ac mae gennych un cyfres arall, na allwch chi gyrraedd unrhyw beth.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0193267_0193395 Watch this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0194506_0194561 I'm sorry about that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0195663_0195780 Well, let's see what we need.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0196279_0197295 Well, in any case, if you left click on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open, then it should cross highlight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0197295_0197410 If not, it can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200617_0200677 Can you make a
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200781_0201493 Is it very difficult to make another GUI but only for a global search?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0201930_0202490 Just take that away, the local checkbox.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202490_0202650 Because they're like, oh.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202772_0202979 Yeah, because in the start screen you can't have them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203231_0203342 Yeah, who do you make that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203342_0203575 That'd be pretty handy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203575_0203798 Everything else can just stay the same, you know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203798_0204134 In fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbox.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0204584_0204934 Really well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0216087_0216123 Are we done?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007053_0007312 Oh, that's her head. She doesn't see first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007312_0007390 I'm gonna stay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0011917_0012147 Okay, good luck.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0017470_0017772 It's just a little chaos
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0019495_0019601 Seems like a lot of things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0020970_0021307 I think I saw that in the chat.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0022410_0023001 It doesn't have anything in it. It does, it has about three lines of XML.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023214_0023273 What's that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023775_0024183 Mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n dweud wrthym, mae'n d

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024302_0024419 That's my man.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024562_0025175 I had lots of stuff in there yesterday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025175_0025310 I hope it's just a...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025310_0025643 I don't know if they live there but they don't have even more stuff there I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025643_0025952 I was unzipping all these crazy huge things that were in the box.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025952_0026083 I needed them, they were for this though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0026083_0026667 It's alright, it's alright.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027076_0027357 Yeah, it's about 8 gigs on it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027357_0027476 So yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027476_0027982 siis ma sõlen ka teid huuleva rahendama
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028614_0028945 شكراً على المشاهدة
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028945_0029123 That was good, really.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029123_0029191 Yeah, that's it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029599_0030007 It generated a lot of exceptions in the background.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0030007_0030205 They didn't cause any problems.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033280_0033537 Yeah, I did discover it, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033537_0033821 I think I'm gonna skip it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033821_0034404 Rwy'n dweud wrthym, rwy'n gwneud y brif, ond dwi ddim yn chwarae'r brif. Dwi ddim yn chwarae'r brif. Dwi ddim yn chwarae'r brif. Dwi ddim yn chwarae'r brif.

Dwi ddim
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034404_0034674 The startup screen is quite good, it looks alright.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034674_0034783 It's okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036267_0036363 Now that's why.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036363_0036835 The only thing is the start up screen is not too pretty.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036835_0037111 Это мало, если чавесы.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038021_0038352 It's not my style. It's not the top priority.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038566_0038773 I think it'd look better on windows as well actually.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038773_0039024 Because Java uses the native Windows, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0039343_0039428 Actually, can we?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0040098_0040140 2, 3, 4
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0041480_0041897 Well, the, um, the, um, speech characterizations are finished.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042029_0042437 I haven't updated all those objects for us yet though because it takes ages on these computers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042437_0042884 It's faster for some bizarre reason if I log in at home and then run the code
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042884_0043116 it runs it much faster than if I do it here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043276_0043666 I can't wait to sit in a lab at Whitehall.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043889_0044535 I've done some flip-flops before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0044535_0044929 You're really speedy, aren't you?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045839_0045916 That's the way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045916_0046646 so that it that itself tells you what speakers are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0046646_0046715 Нет.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047380_0047894 The dialogue acts are all done and they're quite amusing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047894_0048815 But some of them some of the thing actually what I wanted to talk about that a little bit was um There are some that occur all the time that I just and I don't know how interesting there are
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0048815_0049448 So the first one statement is that it will, I've removed it because it was like everything is prefixed by statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0049448_0050088 Every single dialogue act starts with a statement. So everybody's top dialogue act is a statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050088_0050129 So they're dead.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050245_0050314 So I'll go into that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050314_0050682 and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050682_0050792 I don't know what that means.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050792_0050952 Back Channel
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051210_0051277 Is that what that means?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051277_0051370 Oh, we'll keep going.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051370_0051605 And then the other
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051884_0051947 Some people that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051947_0052095 There are some people who don't do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052095_0052411 Yeah, you can see that they've done it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052523_0052876 Yeah!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052876_0053288 Some people have, and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time, yes no questions.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0053288_0053572 So which one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054120_0054797 That's the thing I wanted to know whether or not we because the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five or the top X
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054797_0055107 So you give it a number and we'll give you the top, whatever, for each person.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0055107_0056001 and then each meeting knows about all the different dialogue acts for each person in the meeting and the amount that that occurred.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056001_0056677 and we'll give you that in top order as well or you can just search for each specific dialogue act.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056677_0057267 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddweud yna'r pethau y byddwch chi'n cael eu hafael ar y cyfeiriadau a'r cyfeiriadau yn hytrach na'r ddwyraethau gwirioneddol.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057267_0057447 but I can change that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057447_0057616 So I don't know what we want to display
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057616_0057967 That's what I'm asking you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0058705_0058934 All's a lot, all's like 25.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0059098_0059276 I mean do we care?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061270_0061732 I think we should have the global top five because each speaker's got a top whatever
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061732_0062279 Felly un o'r bocs wedi'i ddeall, dyma fy nghyflawniadau top 5 i'r sgwrs.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0062279_0062926 And then in the meeting you have, well you can either have the most commonly occurring ones or you can have a list of each speakers top dialogue acts.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063063_0063146 either of those.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063146_0063342 No
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063541_0063654 Well, you definitely do not need that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063654_0063991 So he's because it's because it's a speaking window the speaker comes up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063991_0064404 So you've got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0064404_0064962 Yn y cyfres gyntaf y cyfarfod hwnnw, ac y rhai yna.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066048_0066086 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066256_0066714 But often the interesting ones don't occur. Things like joke don't occur very often.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066714_0067023 Well they do sometimes but they're not that common.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067023_0067170 One guy has top 5 chokes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067170_0067229 might have been stoked.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067229_0067328 He's in on the good stuff.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067328_0067396 That's funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067426_0068442 This is good for browsing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0068558_0068633 That's what's best.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069233_0069679 It's taking me to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069860_0070409 Happy Quaker.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0072044_0072846 What percentage of the dialogue acts that he makes are jokes? In the meeting and globally, typically.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073056_0073347 I think most things are coded with it's all okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073347_0073526 A lot of them are cutting with a Z between the labels.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073526_0073733 Felly rydw i'n mynd i gael y cyfan.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073733_0073790 says Warren.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073946_0074059 and statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074059_0074781 And also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something, so if I quote a joke to you, they separate that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074781_0075165 So they put they put the the dialogue X and then he put a double the colon and they put that aside
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075165_0075639 Iawn, dwi'n meddwl y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'n meddwl, ond dwi'r, ond dwi'r, ond dwi'r, ond dwi
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075639_0075772 Yeah, somebody else's doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075772_0076025 So you have to be original about your potatoes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0076025_0076404 I'm gonna go to bed, cuz.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077423_0077500 Yeah, that's too costly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077500_0077559 I'm out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077673_0078155 Ja, also ich finde, es mag ein bisschen kräuschen.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078155_0078195 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078195_0078339 But I think it's pretty much complete.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078339_0078429 So I'll do that tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078429_0078493 Just put it up there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078493_0078683 Mae'n dweud gallwch ddechrau defnyddio'r cyfan.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0080941_0081261 Na, dim ond rydw i'n gwybod ei fod yn cael cyfarfod a chyflwyno.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081261_0081362 I can judge everyone.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081863_0082071 We can put it in a package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082181_0082258 You're gonna be loving it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082410_0082679 It doesn't seem to make any difference, I've never ever used drumming packages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082679_0082941 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082941_0083101 It's in the same direction it works.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0083101_0083343 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0084289_0084638 You can double click on it. Well no.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085342_0085510 Yeah, it was something else.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085510_0085735 Just borrow a little Microsoft GIF like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087174_0087240 You have it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087458_0087887 What have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0089751_0089873 I'm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0090954_0091434 What do you think of the day? MSC's in Informatics and we did it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0091434_0092082 I'll check to see if I can find any more.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093351_0093450 It's really easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093450_0094076 you do it in one of the whatever the main window is you set gear for some set set set picture
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094076_0094130 Yeah, yeah, I-
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094723_0094995 Iawn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095198_0095345 Yeah, yeah, just correct.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095345_0095469 the answer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0096862_0097042 You can even have some sound when it comes on.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097042_0097588 Welcome to the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097588_0097750 No, that's not what I was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097750_0097841 I have to do it anyway.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0098317_0098701 No, but I think if you put headphones in it, it'll just play just normally.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0099842_0099951 from time to time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0106575_0107074 I still can't make it run TNT from gelatin. Are you serious? Maybe I'll try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107074_0107140 Yeah, you too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107140_0107443 I think we might get well chopped.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0108805_0109267 It's a job. Practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0109598_0109694 Cool, let's do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0110835_0110927 Yeah, I think it was.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111060_0111155 すごいです
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111299_0112231 Ac roedd hwn yn cael ei dynnu'n ddiweddar gan fynd i dynnu'r javadoc ac fe wnaeth e'i dynnu'n ddiweddar.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112554_0112756 It's good to know what methods are there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112756_0112904 without having to look at the source code.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112904_0112944 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0113268_0113370 This is it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114442_0114592 知らないよ、それ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114592_0114681 I thought we'd see
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124630_0124769 we didn't have time for meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124769_0124899 Maybe it's just the diet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125011_0125070 Send them an email.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125070_0125180 I probably would do it anyway.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126155_0126235 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126563_0126708 He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0132751_0132990 I'm gonna give it a me a try and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133265_0133358 Bu ne?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133528_0133914 No, it's gonna take forever and then you've got to analyse the results.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133914_0134088 No, no, no, no, no.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0135705_0136941 One computer scientist, one dude off the street. One supposed to be a woman and one supposed to be a man.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0137100_0137490 I just have two.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139417_0139544 Oh, Instagram.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139544_0139677 Yeah, two weeks then.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140616_0140712 That's a lot of money.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140712_0140962 25, 25, 25.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141940_0142114 That's good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145149_0145491 We should try and have it done by then anyway.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147364_0147545 Yeah, and then get out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147696_0147872 We're still writing the reportage and everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147872_0147950 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150022_0150518 That's easy compared to normal.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150813_0151225 and you must have your research...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151225_0151432 Is that in on the 18th?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151652_0152009 How's yours? I don't know, I thought it took me...

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206073_0206264 Yeah, I did think both of them, yeah. Cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206264_0206444 What? I didn't think we were going to bother with that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206444_0206625 Wel, rydyn ni'n gweld hynny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206625_0206726 You're a cousin.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0207919_0208441 Well, we'll certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it. But we're not going to. At the very least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209642_0209821 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209821_0209934 I don't know if I can do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209934_0210340 Even if I happen to manage to make it decent keywords.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210340_0210705 I don't think we can expect YouTube to also come up with a solution for that as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210877_0210998 with
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210998_0211183 So like, choice, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211183_0211507 Ie, rydw i wedi creu'r SMS yn gyntaf, ond nid wyf yn gwneud hynny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211507_0211992 I did have a look at trying to create XML files
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211992_0212200 until another part of the mission.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212200_0212531 It's not as it's as straightforward as writing in XML
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212531_0212781 Mae'n sefydlu'r segment hwn i'r holl ddau.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212781_0213044 It just looks so complicated to get it from.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011518_0011696 No, that's just sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011754_0011982 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012309_0012442 I'll write this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012641_0012696 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012988_0013625 I did not have privileges to get in to update your file.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0013625_0014060 I would actually have meant to send the email and then just continue.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014324_0014843 I forget mine as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014843_0015002 Um, so yeah, I was, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015002_0015254 That was the main thing, so as soon as that's in, it'll be ready.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015254_0015416 I was making a couple of little changes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015416_0015672 So those will be able to play with.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015672_0016188 Still working on the, trying to get the topics in summary search implemented as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016188_0016478 So that's that's for tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016478_0016680 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016680_0016966 I'm not going to lie.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016966_0017340 I'm getting a better feel for all these light objects.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017545_0017761 It's just a little chaos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017761_0018272 Yeah. So it's like if you're going to use this stuff later on in your life.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018272_0018612 You need to spend the time to invest and learn on both of those.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018612_0018924 I'll put to the minimum I can get away with.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018924_0019419 Unless I want to do something like this in the future.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019590_0019753 That's perfect.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019753_0020065 Dear.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020065_0020117 Mm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020297 Okay, anyway, so...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020934_0020962 Bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021106_0021208 I think I get the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021208_0021506 I saw that and I'm just trying to remember if I did create it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021506_0022321 I think I was... because I was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago so that may be mine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022549_0022601 Oh really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022863_0022940 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022940_0023032 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023032_0023273 Yeah, so it's not against the system.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023273_0023456 Güzel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023456_0023857 The gel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024270_0024714 I'm giving false impressions of what's happening.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024880_0025008 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025008_0025238 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025238_0025333 Always armchair.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026232_0026377 I should have quoted on that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026377_0026667 What did it actually do? It's huge.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026667_0026774 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026774_0026982 So we probably won't have to worry about that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0027676_0027902 スタッフさん、お疲れ様でした。
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028023_0028142 I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028142_0028236 How's everything else going?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0029902_0029991 So good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030189_0030281 Do we want to keep that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030281_0030441 Like, are we keeping that how that happens?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030441_0031056 It just prints everything out in the in the shell as well because it does everything just kind of I guess that's its default behavior
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031056_0031237 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031237_0031329 So you can.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0032007_0032077 Oh, right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0034811_0035151 I was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what I was doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035151_0035394 So I didn't take it for a full test run.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035394_0035525 Ond gallwch wneud hynny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035525_0035715 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0036863_0037115 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038183_0038603 I think it is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038603_0038718 better on windows as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038718_0038753 I see.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038753_0038799 tamam
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0039372_0039778 Actually, can we run it on Windows?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040120_0040237 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040589_0040879 Were you using like a GUI builder or just all from the phone?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040968_0041094 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041310_0041492 Just nasty.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041892_0041987 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043448_0043867 Can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043867_0043909 Hehe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043909_0044253 I tried that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0044253_0044625 I've done something like that before. Really, sweetie?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0050822_0050856 So is it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0051559_0051733 It's kind of boring.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0054913_0054979 or whatever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057759_0057819 I'm positive.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057819_0058348 I know we have like a choice so they can filter those out the top most common
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0058348_0058783 Just say okay, we'll show all or show.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059359_0059504 I don't know. It doesn't really matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059504_0059733 I think it would be difficult.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0061216_0061303 I think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067906_0067986 NİLİHAT
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067986_0068106 This is good for browsing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068106_0068152 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068152_0068407 I mean, that's sort of exactly what you want to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068407_0068548 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068837_0068890 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0069493_0069749 It's taking me to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075358_0075462 That's good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075513_0075642 Plus it's not a real joke anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077116_0077494 So that's sort of
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077764_0077829 Yeah, just to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0078649_0079199 When I type in, I'll just recompile the browsers and then just get that. You will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079280_0079699 also uses my previous one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0080103 Actually, do we have naming convention for our source files?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080103_0080384 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080690_0080798 Yeah, that's sort of what I was doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080798_0081025 like for your stuff do you have
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081163_0081249 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081369_0081562 It doesn't look like it's stuck in there at this point.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081562_0081701 I'm just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081701_0081885 Oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082092_0082165 Yeah, that's true too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082282_0082406 Das war meine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082770_0082939 Yeah, good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0084966_0085049 You know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0085720_0085881 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086848_0086949 Yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086949_0086988 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0087619_0087884 I've never seen that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088088_0088254 Super size movie browser.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088254_0088280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088280_0088700 I'm kidding.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089258_0089791 just probably basic text font and just something nice, something solid maybe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089791_0089834 I do.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091917_0092258 Maybe I'll check to see if I can find anyone.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0092806_0093153 How do you add that to the Java program?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093153_0093342 Yn siŵr, dwi ddim yn siŵr.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093342_0093493 It's really easy to do it.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097451_0097610 Can we get sound on these machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097654_0098357 playing any sort of music on the dice machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098357_0098436 Great, thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098676_0098758 Oh, great, great.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098758_0098971 If
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0099427_0099484 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100612_0100744 You're a good boy, I'm proud of you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100972_0101247 Okay, well this looks good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103314_0103778 We're going to be trying to get the output from that. I don't know. Still haven't found out if it's sound.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103900_0104113 feasible to open up more than one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104113_0104744 as many objects as we can for each meeting to do. Like we were going to like figure that the ranking did make sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104744_0105104 like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105104_0105252 So we are going to look through only five of them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105252_0105882 just pick the top five to do the search. And since that's probably what we're looking for anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106821_0106975 Are you serious?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106975_0107255 Maybe I'll try. Yeah, you try. Maybe you might get away.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0107377_0107864 Well, Chuck. Yeah, they'd be surprised because I'm that good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0108383_0108461 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109005_0109126 Yeah, it was just like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109126_0109300 practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109808_0110031 How do you guys find the documentation for NXT?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110161_0110304 Bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110304_0110440 I mean sometimes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112103_0112218 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112218_0112577 Well, it's still this research platform.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112911_0113066 stream
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113122_0113211 I'm just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113883_0114458 Did we have a date for when we actually want the system done? Friday?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0114458_0115163 I thought we changed it to Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115163_0115809 Because the thing is, I mean, we can keep working on little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115809_0115932 cheating.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0116104_0116933 So I don't do we want to set an actual hard deadline for when exactly were we going to start evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117358_0117427 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117427_0117920 We can still come up with like test cases or whatever for the people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117920_0118139 come up with scenarios.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118139_0118504 I mean, that's fairly straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118504_0118703 I'm sure actually.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118703_0118805 예, 이제 그만.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118805_0119034 Just brainstorm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120063_0120141 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120773_0120899 to work on it as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121052_0121445 I've got my Xenology presentation on Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121445_0121759 So much now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0122268_0122340 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123133_0123383 Well, probably have to talk to Steve at some point.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123383_0123515 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123676_0123949 We'll probably just have our regular Tuesday meeting with him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123949_0124267 We could send him an email.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124267_0124755 I think that's why we didn't have the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124939_0125003 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125180_0125261 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125261_0125430 Although, do we really want the answer?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125430_0125786 So if you don't ask, we can push it off.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127258_0127312 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127630_0127793 Right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127793_0127917 We're looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129036_0129224 Yeah, if you have time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129224_0129346 Start spamming people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129674_0129833 Delicious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130060_0130210 It's not going to take long.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130210_0130370 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130898_0131310 Actually, some other friends of mine in different programs might be more willing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131310_0131482 Have more of a break.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131482_0131772 So that you get a range of types of people as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131772_0132330 like not like highly literate.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132330_0132565 I think that might be a good as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132565_0132750 So the wider range of people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132950_0133165 I'm just thinking like three or four maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133165_0133775 I would be good. Really? I was thinking of like 10. No, it would take forever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133872_0133975 Sağ ol.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133975_0134636 I think I did an HCI course a while ago. It's just, that's what they just mean. There's three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134718_0134790 That was fun.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134790_0135144 You can do a massive amount of analysis on three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135305_0135407 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135407_0135572 We don't want to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135862_0136947 One old student and one dude off the street. One supposed to be a woman and one supposed to be a man.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137425_0137628 I'm gonna cry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137628_0137769 Um...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137769_0137988 But yeah, if he finds them, then that's cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137988_0138094 which it means to people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138094_0138215 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138516_0138578 Oh, right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0139203_0139271 two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140242_0140610 I thought evaluation may be for the report.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140610_0140752 So that's 2020.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140752_0140882 I like it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140882_0140970 I thought that was good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140970_0141080 That's what I understand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141247_0141500 I thought he said 25th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141500_0141952 Even though it's Good Friday. It's not Good Friday!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142066_0142163 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142163_0142403 Wow, that's not a good way of writing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142418_0142656 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142656_0143082 Well I'm sure on the website it says the same thing. Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143247_0143567 So that gives us two days to do the evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143567_0143766 No, we thought you were going to say something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143766_0143830 You know, the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144144_0144408 I didn't think so, necessarily.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144408_0144537 I wouldn't assume.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144537_0144643 But we should ask them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145641_0145965 It's probably tight otherwise. It's a good target.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145965_0146120 Yeah, you might.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147092_0147205 Straight away and then get back.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147902_0148058 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148058_0148276 It's just funny to have it finished by Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148276_0148594 because after Monday I'm pretty much free for about a week or so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148594_0149073 It's like, if we had a bit more time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149456_0149558 Oh, the next one, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149558_0149960 free after this Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149960_0150359 That's easy compared to normal.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150359_0150594 I mean I'm not even worried about that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150724_0150827 Yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150827_0150890 And he must have.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151378_0151464 It's not here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151464_0151692 I'm gonna cry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151692_0151764 아주 열심히
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151929_0152096 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0152773_0153143 Maybe that was us, not him. Yeah, that's why I'm pointing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153143_0153293 How much? $5.50.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153647_0153757 Yeah, Thursday, 24th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154007_0154164 to my personal.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154502_0154676 End of lectures.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155209_0155380 So, drüben vor Ort.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155884_0156315 Just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156649_0156753 We should have it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156753_0156839 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157128_0157274 But it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157274_0157747 Is that a part of the demonstration? Do they want that information? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0159586_0159628 So they
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160781_0160938 I'm through.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160938_0161185 Just made some comments at the last meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161185_0161535 Just generally how it all integrates.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161535_0161657 Do we know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161997_0162216 I'd expect somewhere between 10 and 15 pages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162406_0162725 Although it's 50% of the mark, I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162725_0162768 You see?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163174_0163343 Well, we have a good time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163473_0163524 It's gonna be good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0164978_0165201 Just to fine tune and detail. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165315_0165359 more time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165717_0166013 Yeah, that could easily be a 5 or 6 page.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169046_0169143 That'd be true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169143_0169262 No, no big rush.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169501_0169604 Although just to get it out of the way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169604_0169952 So I'm trying to remember to do that tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0171732_0172201 just basic pretty much like the intro. Do you have the intro?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0172201_0172565 Just sort of like Google texting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0173517_0173764 And as it's come up, it just, pop, pop.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174233_0174429 It doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174429_0174744 That's the other big part.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174744_0175073 I mean, how to get that communication between the two different kinds of windows.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175461_0175946 Because of things if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175946_0176441 That was why I'm sort of deciding to get the three pains in there instead of just the one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0176699_0177347 Yeah, so there's a couple of those little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0177347_0177529 Yeah, and makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178574_0178779 Is that how it works in the elements?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178779_0179183 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0179927_0180420 If you have a particular window that you want me to mimic, it's behavior.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180420_0180825 and just fight it in the program and just say, okay, just how this one does it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180825_0181051 So if it's like the topic window or the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0181663_0182241 So you can just trace back and figure out what objects they are bringing to you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0187581_0187863 So one left click just highlights.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188300_0188413 I'll just let him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188570_0188695 the transcript or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0189392_0189561 You can see
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0190694_0190785 This should be close.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191221_0191242 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191550_0191944 Although, yeah, this is actually different from how we printed up here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191944_0192057 like if we're doing a global search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192057_0192623 then we are going to do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192623_0192899 And then we'll either multi-select or...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192899_0193337 choose the one we want to actually do this I think multi-select would make more sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193337_0193727 Well, just if there's like three of the top meetings like we said before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193727_0194086 language, looking for the word language and get the highest rated ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194086_0194615 Actually look for the terms we're not loading it on fall 76.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194615_0195308 So the results from that will narrow down what we're going to use for the local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195308_0195571 So we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195571_0195821 Oh, I see what you mean. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195821_0196372 So it will be a bit different from how that is right now. When we do the research at least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197254_0197407 Yes. If not, it can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197407_0197508 Good time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0201665_0201959 So that we search to just.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0202422_0202634 Let's actually...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203017_0203143 Yeah, local anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203143_0203227 Very nice, easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203227_0203393 Yeah, we'll be right back. Love you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203393_0203597 It's quite strengthful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206489_0206636 Wel, o ran yr hyn rydw i'n ei ddweud,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206636_0206734 Evet hazırım.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206901_0207310 Are we bothering with our topic stuff?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207310_0207511 Horizontal, like our own topic segment.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207511_0207760 Like since we can't do the labeling and all the rest.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207760_0207915 we're still doing our topic segment.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207915_0208053 Well, what's that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0208316_0209096 But we're not going to be doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they don't have labels.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209233_0209491 All the label ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209491_0209673 Get off of my Bluetooth.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209673_0209740 What?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210577_0210642 I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210642_0210701 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210701_0210871 Well, no, it would be kind of straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210871_0211092 If you're quitting, it's your fault.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218435_0218498 Probably not.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218498_0218791 I mean, just get work done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218791_0218984 I think that's what I've got to do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001099_0001453 We're not allowed to get in light so who's the cleanest person?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001887_0002029 Unfortunately, because of the...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002237_0002381 I'm not supposed to be standing up there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002986_0003229 Я это...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008190_0008382 Hello everybody.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008382_0009196 I'm Sarah, the project manager and this is our first meeting, surprisingly enough.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009196_0009474 Iawn, dyma ein cyfrifiad.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009568_0010193 byddwn yn gwneud rhai pethau, gael ein gwybod each arall ychydig yn well i meddwl mwy cyffredinol ag each arall.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010193_0010814 Then we'll go do tool training, talk about the project plan.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010814_0011589 a chyfathrebu ein syniadau ein hunain a phethau. Ac mae gennym 25 munud i'w wneud o'r hyn rwy'n gallu deall.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0011762_0012154 Now we're developing a remote control which you probably already know.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012154_0012699 We wanted it to be original, something that people hadn't thought of.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012699_0013201 nid yw'n ymlaen yn y sioe, yn dynol, yn ymddangos i ffyrdd fawr.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0013201_0014283 but not a whole lot of metal. And user-friendly, grannies to kids, maybe even poochies, should be able to use it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014283_0014958 Iawn. Y cyntaf yw'r dylunio ffwngsiynol. Dyma lle rydym ni i gyd yn mynd i wneud gwaith unigol.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014958_0015940 beth mae angen arnegeddau ar gael gan gael y prods, beth mae angen arnegeddau ar gael gan gael y prods a sut mae'n mynd i wneud hynny.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0015940_0016094 ysgrifennol.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0016231_0016780 what we're thinking, how it's going to go, and then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017038_0017203 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017203_0018410 We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard. I'll go first. And sum up the characteristics of that animal.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0018883_0019207 Okay. Space bag moments.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0021146_0021197 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024322_0024433 I am leaving.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024789_0025060 And I'm going to ask you to get something to carry that's worth three times.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025453_0025724 and I see them as majestic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025989_0026225 a'r
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0027231_0027542 Now, who would like to go next?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028757_0028966 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028966_0029010 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0035001_0035109 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0037384_0037686 Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039399_0039492 Obrigado.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039631_0039980 Are you a crocodile?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0042011_0042095 That's lovely.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0043985_0044177 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0046109_0046216 Technical help.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0048966_0049134 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0050119_0050466 Iawn. Nid unig.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0055448_0055515 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056312_0056546 Diolch yn fawr.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056546_0057464 Finance wise we've got a selling price at 25 euros which I don't actually know what that is in pounds at all.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0057464_0057532 Any ideas?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058385_0058512 Yeah, that's it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058638_0058798 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0059098_0059592 I think so. I think I'd be able to put it up or I could put it in the shared folder.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0060813_0060929 I suppose each of it depends.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061351_0061782 Yeah, production costs are £12.50.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061913_0062426 half of the cellulose is taken up by blood.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0062426_0062944 and profit aim is 50 million euros which is a
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0063129_0063642 Ie, yn y bryd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0064913_0065029 and everyone using it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0065357_0066222 Yn y bôn, mae'n dweud y byddwn yn ymwneud â'r grŵp ar gyfer y cyfrifiadau.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0066222_0066970 and making that key point, just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067520_0067829 What are your experiences with remote controls?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067829_0068347 I mean, I've got, we got, we had three videos.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0068347_0069167 a TV and sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069167_0069939 a'ch rhaglenwch pob un o'ch pethau i mewn, ond roedd hynny'n cadw'r cyflwyniadau felly rhaid i ni gael ei rhaglenu yn unrhyw ddod â'n
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069939_0070270 I think it was quite cheapy as well.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070270_0070483 but that was quite good, the fact that you could...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070596_0070891 I didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of me.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073498_0073730 Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073730_0075176 I mean, and you don't want to, I hate, I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0075743_0077073 when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions when you can do sound or options kind of recording.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077073_0077283 things like that inside it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077283_0077979 oherwydd nid yw'n gwneud, pan fyddwch chi'n ei ddewis, nid yw'n gwneud ei fod yn anodd iawn i edrych arno. Mae'n amlwg beth rydych chi'n ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081235_0081365 What about the older generation?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081365_0081509 What about granny and granddad's?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081615_0082363 I obviously would listen. My granddad can answer his mobile phone but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0082812_0083151 I do not think they teach things. My grandad taught you better than that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0084120_0084324 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0086430_0087174 Dwi ddim yn hoffi'r newydd ffônau sydd gan gynllun rhedeg ar wydw.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087295_0087683 I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the first place.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087683_0088287 I have not got a new one but my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and it just kept getting lost.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0088438_0088517 That's just me.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0090577_0090750 I'll just say it's got that optional screen.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091369_0091737 I brought back kind of a dual function.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091737_0092964 in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, program things and also a menu to go into with obvious pictures.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0092964_0093488 obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0094848_0095316 I think that's a cost thing. I don't know how much we're going to know about.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0095602_0095807 Yes.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0097097_0097935 Rwy'n credu bod yna ddau o'r wythnos nesaf, felly byddwn i'n mynd i alluogi a wneud ein pethau unigol.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0098120_0098951 I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102232_0102399 Every project.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102504_0102689 I mean, the Sky Remote Controls and everything.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102689_0103258 and they're kind of moulded and look a bit different than the Talley West remote controls, they're silver plastic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103258_0103865 which looks a bit smarter. So yeah, I guess that's definitely a good thing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103865_0104156 Okay, so let's break it up there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104313_0104416 So see you in half an hour.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104776_0104904 Thanks, Joe.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002515_0002683 I feel bad for these kids.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002912_0003048 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0003130_0003339 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0004975_0005318 Thank you for watching!
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0030638_0030720 Kind of dope.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0035651_0036214 Rhowch i mi roi cymaint o le ar y ffocs ar y ddŵr.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0037680_0037894 I think it's outstandingly good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0042144_0042234 and
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0044316_0044795 I'm very impressed with your artistic skills.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0044795_0045085 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0045400_0045694 Skaffolding
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0045797_0046057 Diolch.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0046538_0046851 Mae'n ddiddorol iawn i'r dynion.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0046851_0047088 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0047441_0047935 yna
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0048126_0048468 It doesn't look like what I want it to be.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0048877_0049141 Nid yw'n ddiddorol iawn.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049290_0049778 Mae'r ddechrau'n gwella'r bod yn y noc.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049778_0049996 My dreadful of the one death.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049996_0050809 Mae'n dylen i fod yn seagull. Nid seagull. Gallai fod yn seagull, ond mae'r plant yn seagull.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0050809_0051149 Ac yna fe wnaethon ni. Unwaith eto, dw i'n meddwl ar fy ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051149_0051612 Mae'r rhain hefyd yn ddigon ddiogel, ond byddai'r un yn ddifrif.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051612_0051866 Um...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052028_0052492 Ydych chi'n dweud maent yn dda i golf?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052492_0052624 Ego.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052691_0052920 Iawn, dwi ddim yn dda.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052920_0053660 Mae'r coefi'n cael ei ddysgu, yn fflwng ar y rhan bawb.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054142_0054715 a phraesau i'r gofyn, diolch yn fawr.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054715_0054953 I'm trying.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0055366_0055677 and the garden, and the view.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058488_0058597 I'm so lonely.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058837_0058954 Should we be making notes of this?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058954_0059174 Dwi'n credu fy mod i'n dweud hynny.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0059174_0059228 I think that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0060809_0061392 Mae'n dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063037_0063120 in our first year.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063810_0064823 Mae gennych ffocws ar farchnadau busnes.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0064823_0065111 unrhyw un, unrhyw un, defnyddio'r enw i unrhyw un.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0065341_0065540 Big target group. Yes.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071292_0071717 My experience is only being given the remote control with the object I buy.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071717_0072244 Nid ymwneud â phrogramio gyda'r ffilm, ond yn defnyddio'r ffilm i'w programio i fideo a TV.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072244_0072768 Ond yn gwirioneddol ar, ar, fwy, ag, a'r dda. Ffwnction gwirioneddol.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072768_0073605 Dwi ddim yn meddwl y gallaf fynd ymlaen gyda hynny. Mae'n rhaid i rai o bobl ddefnyddio hynny.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0075081_0075529 or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0076852_0076898 and we'll see you next time.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0077978_0078326 Mae hynny'n golygu pwynt, rwy'n gobeithio yr ydych chi'n meddwl am yr unig fath yw'r dylunio.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078326_0078704 ond gwybodwch fod ar ffôn cyfansoddol, gallwch ddysgu'r clwp a'i roi i'ch menyw.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078704_0079448 Mae gennych ni ddiflwyno mwy. Rwy'n meddwl y byddwn yn cymryd hynny i ddylunio control ymhellach fel y gallwch chi fod yn cael diflwyno LCD.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0080380_0080592 with menus.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0082379_0082797 Can he program his remote control or is he basic with that too?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083464_0083927 Felly dyna'r broblem, yn gydraddoldeb â phosibl adnoddau dylunio a wnaethoch chi ddod o hyd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083927_0084464 Bydd hwn yn broblem o gwbl gyda'r generasio o oedran.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0093518_0094012 The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094012_0094353 You can have a flip-top remote control so that when you flip over the top
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094353_0094756 Gallwch gael sgrin fwyaf yn y fflipover.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095678_0095860 I think we might have this.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101370_0101720 quite good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101720_0101945 Iawn.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0102210_0102441 Yeah. I agree.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035911_0036174 I'm just standing on a chair.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0036174_0036765 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037143_0037529 and also my drawing skill isn't that great well as you can see the quilt
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037960_0038448 Okay, now I'm going to change what it was originally. That looks like a beak.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039795_0040627 Well, firstly it was an attempt at a T-Rex, and then it sort of changed into a pelican, but it can be a hurricane.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0097068_0097179 네.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0098880_0099666 Just a quick thing about what you were saying about it doesn't need to be fashionable.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0099666_0100524 I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the we put the fashion into electronics
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0100524_0101484 So I think the whole design thing might be clutch. I mean you can still have plastic and it look quite good but...

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029332_0029602 Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031347_0031914 It's actually sitting. It's sitting, it's not standing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031914_0032186 Okay, I see it as one thing, it's very supportive.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032413_0032773 it's your best friend in you, you can talk to your dog, it can be your best friend in you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032773_0033136 It doesn't discriminate between you based on what you want.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0033136_0034096 Second is Loyal And third thing is Intuition
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0034096_0035106 So basically these are the three unique features I think belong to your book.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057676_0057871 Bunlar mı?

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0061754_0061959 Okay, pretty huge amount of cash.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0063639_0063710 and
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0069149_0069222 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0070861_0071104 You want to integrate everything into one?

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0078708_0078774 I'm going to go menu.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079289_0079360 looking out.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079446_0080057 I was thinking of the same lines. Instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080057_0080603 Maybe have an LCD display or something like that, like a mobile? With menus.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080603_0081203 And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0081521_0081896 My granddad can answer his own questions.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0094604_0094666 Okay.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095738_0095924 but it might have its cost implications.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0104805_0104838 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000818_0000982 Is that clear?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000982_0001080 It's great that...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003704_0003883 I'm alive.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0006681_0007420 Right, okay. Just a second, I'm waiting. And I might be a bit out of place.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0007420_0007886 Right, our agenda for today... Do you want us to give you a second?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008127_0008353 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008593_0008870 I'll go over what we decided last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0009263_0009912 We decided upon a universal control, one hand set for all to be video.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0010181_0011216 that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0011216_0012023 We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, we put fashion in electronics, that kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0012023_0012947 our budget would have to try not to reflect our budget.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013141_0013633 I have a bit of... Oh, oh you can see it. Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013633_0014340 a dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted it to look like.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014485_0014869 oedran ni eisiau ei weld yn ddiweddar, yn ddiweddar, yn y casglu.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014869_0015936 We discussed a flip open design, reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming, things like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016324_0016680 I've got written here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016866_0017062 Shall we hear from marketing first?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017503_0017732 No, that's fine. That's fine. Okay, yeah, I'm good.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084490_0084543 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0103869_0104058 Right, um...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0104172_0104485 We have new project requirements.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0105110_0106034 We're not going to be using teletext. Apparently consumers consider it outdated with the internet now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106240_0106856 our control is only going to be for TV, it's not going to be combined control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106856_0107844 which limits the cost for us but also makes it easier to understand further.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0108057_0109180 says for TV only so looks like it's just yeah I think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it but
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109419_0109550 I don't know what do you think?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109550_0109781 it just said for TV only.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109781_0110213 Yn gyfranoliadwy, mae cyfansoddiadau TV yn gwneud fideo hefyd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0110444_0110888 I mean, well, all of a sudden you get combined TV and video, don't you?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0112245_0112700 Rwy'n credu ein bod ni'n ymddangos bod yna ffynonellau a chweithredu sy'n dal i gael chwarae.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0118844_0119020 Ie.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120074_0120646 We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120646_0121783 So I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing because it is something and it needs to be the thing that you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0121865_0122367 used to find it needs to be something that you don't lose. You were saying whistling.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122367_0122886 maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122886_0123385 y bwysau ar y tŷ TV ac mae'n bipio.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123385_0123711 something like that but that sounds a lot cheaper to me
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123800_0124766 The third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0124766_0125253 So we want logo, we want...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125490_0125856 ffasiynol, dynol, yr hyn rydych chi'n siarad am gyda'r cyfleuon.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125931_0126371 people paying more for it to look good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0126492_0126781 We need to focus on that as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132038_0132750 What about, you were talking about the buttons. The controls that are coming out now have big
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132750_0133469 rubber buttons not tiny little big rubber buttons but modified I mean because we got to make it original
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133620_0133736 What about...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133869_0134201 You know with the touch screen computers?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0134432_0135394 So it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button, which shouldn't wear out as much either.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135518_0135840 Dydyn ni'n gadael y cyd-destun, ond mae'n rhaid i chi ddod o hyd i'r cyd-destun.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135840_0137075 I think that might appeal, I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking young office people, trendy kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137206_0137531 but quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137531_0138564 easily labelled so that anyone can say, oh yeah, that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0140284_0140357 little bit of physics.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0145256_0146158 I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146158_0146540 or they can make it bigger or they can change features slightly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146796_0147715 Mae'n mynd i fod yn yr un peth, felly mae angen i ni ffocus ar un peth, a ddim i gael pobl yn mynd, ac mae llawer o bobl sy'n gallu gwneud hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0151286_0151974 or speech recognition which is extremely expensive. I think that's the only way that you can provide
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0152084_0152177 yn y gynhyrchu.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0154752_0155002 We were talking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155203_0155496 the type of company that we're working for as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155496_0156520 eu bod nhw eisiau eu bod yn ffasiynol, eu bod nhw eisiau eu bod yn dynol, ac nid ydych chi'n ymddangos yn awtomatig, yn asocio â'r generiadau oedran.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0156520_0157418 Nawr, gyda'r fyrwyr bach, mae'r generatioau oedol yn fwy, maen nhw'n boblwyr mwyaf na'r bobl ifanc.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0157418_0157983 But I don't think we're focusing on that. I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0158124_0158361 business class type people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160471_0160942 Okay, so... the remote control functions...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160942_0161612 We've got the TV, we've got the video. Now there is...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0161750_0162392 I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of program details. Video plus. Yes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0162580_0163755 We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that. I always found that really easy when I discovered it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0163884_0164486 because you've got your general record anyway so if there's a program on you want to put record on.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164486_0164979 that's fine but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164979_0165402 you put the number in and it's just a number it's not a date it's not time
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0165402_0165877 It's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just numbers.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166423_0166641 You've already got the numbers for Tappian anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166940_0167575 is after if you look in the newspaper or TV guide or any TV guide there's a five star
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0167575_0169104 six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at 10 o'clock on the 17th, things like that so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169104_0169455 And it has been around for a long time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169712_0170288 No, it's not. I think if awareness was brought to the forefront about that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0172221_0172299 Okay, so...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0179443_0180041 The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your TV's not doing it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0180125_0180592 taking your TV and your controller and saying, look, this is what I'm doing, it's not working, what should I do?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181366_0181542 I think so, okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181827_0181972 instruction manuals.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181972_0182307 But I mean, there's customer service.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0182307_0183125 there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charges.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0183125_0183634 is no extra person have to walk to a shop in the high street
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0184469_0185430 But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing in lots and lots of pages.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185430_0185816 It does. You just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185816_0186123 So that should be something we're thinking about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186123_0186346 What other functions?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186346_0186957 We need, I'm not sure if we need a design decision now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186957_0187714 but we should think about, because you've got the dilemma between, oh batteries, that's what I was thinking about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0187714_0187922 What about film batteries? What kind of batteries are there?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0188854_0189772 Wel, maen nhw'n dal yn eithaf amser. Ac os oes gennych... y peth y gaelwch chi gyda'r ffyrddau'r ysgolau cymdeithasol...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0189772_0190169 you set it in its charger when you're not using it or at night or something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190169_0190674 ond mae'n bwysig iawn ei fod yn ddiddorol amdano, oherwydd nid yw'n gadael yn ddiweddar, oherwydd mae'n golygu bod yn ddur i'r amser yr unwaith y mae'n cael ei hyrwyddo.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190674_0191003 something like that should reduce the size of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0191820_0192107 Yeah, it could be on that. Yeah, that one as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0192773_0192946 rechargeable with a documentation.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193074_0193261 So the recharge voltage should be here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193952_0194291 Yes, which is cheaper in the long run as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194291_0194770 y ffordd y gwellaeth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194770_0195498 I don't want a big box with lots of things. You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0195498_0196249 because then you have got the repetitive strain engine no matter how much you try and make it simple.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0196609_0196676 KJ.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0197718_0197875 Okay, so we've got a flip screen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0201381_0201563 Just kind of move it to your hand anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0202640_0203026 Can you look into the company logo?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0203150_0204079 things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204079_0204130 I mean.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204322_0205260 For example, if it was a C or something like that, you could have it in a vague C shape that opens up, kind of like a shell.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0205260_0205875 or something. Something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0206040_0206644 yn y dylunio, yn ystod gwneud yn wahanol o beth eraill yna.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0208341_0208598 Well, we need to think about how it is going to look different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212165_0212769 neu fe allwch chi wneud ffasheoedd gwahanol fel y gallwch chi gael gyda ffilmau cyfansoddol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212769_0213100 You could have different kind of casings.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0213100_0213867 So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0216498_0216776 Rwy'n credu ein bod ni'n rhaid i ni gyrraedd y cyfan.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0218236_0219067 That was in cutting down the number of functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0219067_0219618 making it simpler, so instead of having lots of things to put in for dates.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0220670_0221444 It kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221444_0221589 doing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221657_0222602 Yes, it could be an advertisement feature rather than a design feature. Draw attention to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0222671_0223557 ac hefyd gael gwasanaeth ddŵr yn y cyfrifiadwyr. Oherwydd mae'n ddimplwm iawn, felly byddai'n ddefnyddio'r gwaith yn ddefnyddio ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0224964_0225675 We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0226198_0226844 ac rydyn ni wedi siarad am y bydd yna alarm neu rhywbeth o beipio ar gyfer cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael ei gael yn cael yn cael yn ca
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227005_0227308 learning how to use it should be as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227308_0228085 Ond nid ydyn ni'n mynd i fod yn y ffynciau sy'n cael eu cynhyrchu i mewn i'r ffynciau, felly byddai'n iawn. Ac mae'r cyfnod o ddysgu yn y manwl.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228085_0228384 I don't know if we deal with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228594_0228670 I think.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228984_0229266 Iawn. A'n different ar draws hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0229266_0229414 I think that's us.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230012_0230375 I think you might get guidance but...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230550_0230564 I
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230717_0230976 instruction manuals because there tends to be a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0231160_0231851 demonize the thing, everyone's got a big pile of them but no one really uses them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0232414_0232555 Yes, right.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233087_0233150 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233342_0233739 I think you can email me if there's any more questions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233929_0234196 And I'll be able to not answer.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0004768_0004918 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0008031_0008152 No, that's okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0017101_0017584 Is it okay if I postpone that until later? I just want to get access to a little bit more information. No, that's fine.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0031970_0032302 Iawn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0032302_0032675 Hayır hayır.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0033595_0033876 those batteries in.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0034157_0034256 I'm just wondering.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0051715_0052358 It's a very important point, it came up in our market research findings too, so I can refer to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060486_0060728 It's good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060904_0061000 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080309_0080569 Oh my gosh, a case is here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080569_0080653 comes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080875_0081185 I don't know if you have to, we just didn't.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081185_0081594 Whoops, I need to push it a bit more.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081594_0081740 감사합니다.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081740_0082067 Yep.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083136_0083235 Yw hynny'n iawn?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083679_0083990 Diolch.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084171_0084387 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084563_0085725 Iawn. Rydw i'n mynd i edrych ar y cyfrifoldeb ffynediol trwy edrych ar y pwynt o edrych ar y cyfrifoldeb. Ac yn amlwg, ein pwynt dechrau gyda'r cyfrifoldeb yw'r ymchwil ymarferol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0085725_0086149 So that's where we started. We used our usability lab.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086149_0086670 ymddiriedolaeth y cymdeithasol, fe wnaethon ni gynllunio'n amlwg ein methodau ddifrifol i ddod o ran y cyhoedd gyffredinol.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087219_0087626 y defnydd o'r cwbl yma.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087633_0088097 Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088097_0088814 Y peth cymdeithasol y mae gen i ar y gop yn Italics yw bod defnyddion y gwirioneddol o edrych a chyfieithu'r cyflawniad cyflawniadol gyfraith.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088814_0089076 sydd â'r cyfleoedd dylunio amlwg yno.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089076_0089559 Rydyn ni'n credu bod 75% o'r defnyddwyr yn teimlo bod cyflawniau masgynion yn ddiddorol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089695_0090332 80% would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. We were quite surprised by that finding.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0090332_0091220 Ond mae'n rhan fawr o ein grŵp targed gweithredol, sy'n barod i'w gofalu am farnach mwy i rai pethau sy'n edrych yn dda.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091220_0091790 Mae'r cwblwydau'r hynod o'r cyfansoddiadau'n dod â'r ymdrechion gweithredu ar gyfer y defnyddwyr yn y cyfan.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091790_0092588 Fel enghraifft, gallwch weld ar y ffordd yna, 75% o'r defnyddwyr yn ymgyrchu. Felly mae eich person yn cael ei gael yn y siofa, yn y canolfan.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092588_0092783 Felly, eto, mae cyfleoedd pŵer yno.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092792_0093454 50% o'r defnyddwyr ddefnyddio unig 10% o'r botwmau, felly, eto, unrhyw ddifrif o ddyluniad.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0093454_0094252 A gallwn hefyd gyrraedd y cyfrifau ar ôl os nad oes cyfnodau ar y cwbl rheol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0094690_0095591 Y cyfrifoldeb mwyaf y caiff pobl ei ddod o ran y penderfyniadau personol oedd rhywbeth rydych chi'n siarad yn ôl. Mae cyfartalau ymhellach yn ofal yn aml yn y stryd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0095591_0096272 o'r sgwrs yn y chanol ymlaen. Roedd 50% yn ymdrechgar yn enwedig o hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0096272_0097238 Mae 34% o bobl yn dweud bod angen cymaint o amser i ddysgu a ddefnyddio. Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n cydnabod â'r ddysgu oedran o bobl sy'n defnyddio 10% o'r botwmau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0097238_0097521 sy'n gallu mynd i'r ffwrdd i ddysgu am y pethau eraill.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0097607_0098356 Mae'n dweud bod ymgyrchu gweithredol yn dda i'r rhan fwyaf o bobl.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0098356_0098896 Mae'r cymaint o weithiau ar gyfer y cwbl hir yn galluogi problemau ysgolion a chynlluniau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0098896_0099689 Mae'r mwyaf o'r grŵp 35 a'r ddysgwyr o'r ddegau yn hoffi ddangos crystal llwybr a chyfathrebu sgwrs.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0099689_0100431 Yn ogystal â'r cyflawniadau, rwy'n credu, pan oedden nhw'n cael eu haedlu o'r control ymlaen, rhai gwybodaeth o sbïaeth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100431_0100548 Something we didn't put to them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100548_0101364 ond rwy'n meddwl ar hyn o bryd, efallai y gall y cwbl o'r llwyr alluogi'r gwirionedd bob un ar ôl i chi ddod o hyd i'r hoff llwyth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101496_0101820 Mae'r trend hwnnw yn ymwneud â'r grwpiau oedran.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101820_0102050 So 30 fans and unders who would like those two features.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102050_0102645 Mae hynny'n teimlo'n unig o 35 i 45, ac yn y grŵp oedran mae'n rhoi'r cyflawn, nid ydynt mor anodd gyda hyn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102724_0103167 I have marvellous tables and things that I could show you but I think I'll just keep it simple
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0103167_0103614 Os oes unrhyw fwy o wybodaeth, gallaf e-bwysig arnyn nhw.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0107683_0108058 Felly, a allwn ni ddifrindio fideo gyda'r cwbl hir?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0108448_0108535 It's just.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0109768_0109931 I mean general TV
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0110866_0111006 Yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0113429_0114281 Nid oeddwn yn edrych arno i hynny, ond rwy'n cofio ein bod yn cael y cyfieithu bod y mwyaf o bobl yn defnyddio 10% o'r botwmau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114281_0114818 Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n teimlo fel y canolbwyntio cyffredinol sy'n golygu pethau ar ac oed i'r fideo.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114818_0115453 ac ati. Rwy'n credu bod yna ddysgu cyffredinol y bydd pobl yn cael eu hysbysu'n rhaglen eu fideo.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0115453_0115669 Felly, dwi ddim yn gwybod a yw hynny'n rhywbeth rhaid i ni ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0116582_0117240 I just called up that table there. We asked those two questions. The table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0117240_0117928 A oes gennych chi fwyaid am sgrin LCD, yw'r amrywiaeth mwyaf? A oes gennych chi fwy o gael cyflawni sgrifennol yn y cwbl hir?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0117928_0118404 Felly gallwch weld sut mae'r angen i'w gwybod yn ffurfio drwy'r grwp o oedran.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0118404_0118899 Mae nifer o ddiddordebau yn y byd oedran yn eithaf cyffrous.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0119631_0119703 below.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0123366_0123469 Something like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0126734_0127142 Wow. Further market research will be needed to focus on what that is.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0127142_0127782 bydd yn wahanol i 15-oed, i rywun sy'n 60. Ac hefyd, ar draws byd Remy yng nghaerdydd gweithredol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0127782_0128591 beth sy'n atrychol i'r Newyorker sy'n dynnu'n dynnu a beth sy'n atrychol i'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Newyorker sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwneud â'r Africanaeth sy'n ymwnewd â'r Africanaeth sy' sy'
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0128591_0128772 Mae'n mynd i ddifrifo ar y rôl.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0128772_0129154 Yn ddiweddar, mae'r dylunio enghreifftio yn un peth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0129154_0129967 y dylunio'r ddefnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r ddefnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio'r defnyddio
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0137001_0137251 Okay, so the pouter sections of the line are done.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0138337_0138495 generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0146528_0146951 Mae'r dylunio mewnol wedi cael gwahanol beth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0147756_0148224 I'm concerned when you raise the RSI issue again, repetitive strain injury.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148224_0148581 I don't think just putting your finger under a small screen is going to deal with that enough.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148581_0148982 I think that is still a kind of question or issue, how we deal with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148982_0149485 Mae'r RSI yn teimlo ei fod yn cael ei wneud gan weithiau bach yn arwain.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0149607_0150179 Dwi ddim yn gallu cael fy nghydweithiau'n ddiweddar, efallai y byddwn yn rhaid i mi gael fy nghyflawni ar gyfer ein cyfarfod diwethaf, ond mae'n rhywbeth y byddwn i'n ei feddwl amdano.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0151052_0151322 I know I'm going to be jealous of the gentleman.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0152211_0152875 do we have to initially, looking at the findings here, focus on
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153020_0153426 yn y grŵp oedran ynghylch, ac yna'n ychydig o'r farchnad nesaf.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153426_0153757 Mae'n rhaid i ni fynd ar gyfer pob un yn unig?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0154265_0154787 Mae'n dweud y byddwn yn ddweud ein syniadau, rydym yn siarad yn awtomatig am bobl gweithiol, pobl ifanc, pobl ddrawethol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158340_0158878 I'm just thinking of literature issues too for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158878_0159335 Os ydych chi am wasgu arian, neidwch i fod yn proflegydd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159538_0159772 in a focus on where the idea will be taken up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159772_0160276 mae'n eithaf mor eithaf eithaf eithaf yn y bryd y mae'r pŵer cymdeithasol yn dod o hyd i'r prosiect fel hyn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0166569_0167039 I'm not going to cross that function but it sounds wonderful.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0167960_0168027 And it's...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0171461_0171636 So
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172320_0172808 Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me? I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172808_0173473 Ond dim ond ymddisgu'r grwpiau o'r amser a'r grwpiau o'r amser sy'n cyflawni'r ffônau'n fyw.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0173473_0174307 Dyma beth sy'n ein hysgwrs i ni ymgyrchu controlau TV ychydig gyda'u ffeaturau dylunio. Mae cymdeithasau gweithredol fel ymgyrch Carphone
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174307_0174740 Gallwch chi fynd ymlaen ar unrhyw amser gyda'r ffôn rydych chi wedi'i brynu arnynt os oes gennych problemau gyda'r ffôn a byddant yn ei wneud yn eu gadael.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174740_0175078 the company, you can use their telephones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175078_0175985 Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175985_0176511 Os ydyn nhw'n gwybod, gallant ddod i un o'n canolbwyntiau ystafell y ffyrdd. Yr un beth yw'r botwm rydw i'n ei gysylltu ar hyn?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0176511_0176914 Mae hwn yn asbect arall, a ydy hyn yn gwneud y cymaint yn fwy atrof iddo?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180470_0180828 I reckon what should I do? If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180828_0181323 But I mean, if there were any more, or it would be absolutely definite, it's only going to be for TV and video.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0181323_0181622 Ie, dwi'n credu.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0184190_0184550 ddod yn ôl.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185334_0185586 It does.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185840_0186028 Mae hynny'n rhaid i ni ddweud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196261_0196662 Ac rydyn ni ddim, dwi'n meddwl bod llawer o gyfweliadau arall yn edrych yn unigol iawn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196662_0197058 ymchwil.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0197058_0197764 Mae'n beth amser yn amlwg i allu o'r rectangleau ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0200379_0200552 banana
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0206780_0206923 And that's what I do.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0208703_0209017 I think that's... that sounds a really attractive idea.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209017_0209569 ddod allan o unrhyw beth fel hyn o'r blaen, os yw'n gallu, ie, ac mae hynny'n ddechrau i'ch ddwylo.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209569_0209833 And it's nice to help you can make it lightweight plastic.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209833_0210338 nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210338_0210880 So that's going to take care of some of the additive strain injury, try and prevent a lot of it I would think.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210880_0211441 Rwy'n credu ei fod yn syniad da iawn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0211441_0212121 You can still think of the designs you can get in plastic, you can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213830_0213973 less chance of it being lost to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213973_0215162 ddim yn un o losenge chocolate brown sy'n mynd i lawr y Saen Fawr. Efallai y bydd pobl eisiau ei roi ar eu mantopi neu beth bynnag os oes yn edrych yn agored arno. Ac nid ydyn nhw'n mynd i'w defnyddio'n fawr.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0215162_0215553 Mae'n haws i'w ddweud, mae'n dda i'w gynnal.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0216798_0217196 Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements that I haven't missed anything?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0217196_0218132 Nid yw'r telyddau, ond ar gyfer TV a fideo ar gyfer y cyfleoedd. Mae'r ffotograff cymdeithasol yn ei chyfrifo yn y controli eraill. Rhai pethau am fideo plus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219412_0219960 I think it's pretty great.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219960_0220091 byddent yn edrych ar y cyfarwydd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0220232_0220665 neu yw hyn ddim o ran y cyfrifiadau prosiect?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0221346_0221738 Felly mae'n gwneud... gallai fod yn ffeitio cyfrifol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223519_0223739 And the rechargeable batteries.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223739_0224192 A oes unrhyw beth eraill yna i'w wneud?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225709_0225935 That's not at the moment a requirement, it's something we're looking at.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225935_0226310 Iawn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229455_0229731 What would you specifically like marketing to look at for the next meeting?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229731_0230004 neu i mi edrych yn gyffredinol ar yr holl ddiddordeb?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232273_0232423 Oops.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232530_0232698 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017650_0017791 Okay, yeah, I'll go first.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017791_0017931 What?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019155_0019224 Press it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019224_0019332 I'll do things.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019684_0019789 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0020998_0021062 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021250_0021849 This is the work in design presented by me, the industrial design instructor.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021996_0022501 Okay, this is where I went a bit mad with Pathway Insane.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022501_0022885 Y peth cyntaf y byddwn i'n gofyn yw beth rydyn ni'n ceisio dylunio.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022885_0023358 Mae'r debyg yn ei fod yn rhoi'r cyfle i'r TV ddewis y stade.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023358_0023844 y gallai hynny fod yn fawr, neu'r canol, neu'r fwy,
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023844_0024692 Mae'r cyfan yma yn unig sylwad o weithio i newid y ffynonell o'r TV neu o'r cyflwyniadau eraill sy'n ei ddangos'r sylwad.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0024903_0025738 Felly decidwais i gael edrych ar beth y mae pobl eraill wedi'u dylunio a chroesawu rhai o ddifrifoldeb o hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0025738_0026006 Ond, er bod ni'n mynd i ddweud...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0026148_0027208 o bobl eraill, rydyn ni eisiau sicrhau bod ein dylunio'n dod allan ac rwy'n meddwl bod hynny'n rhywbeth, na, na, nid oedd yn ardal rydw i, oherwydd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027266_0027489 I'm dealing with the inside really.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027489_0028055 Yeah I ran out of time so I'm going to do this one as fun as it is.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0028055_0029482 Ac rwy'n gweld bod cyfnod o ddynion yn defnyddio rhai ffyrdd o dynion i'w rhoi'r cyfnod i'r TV, yn eithaf cyffredinol, oherwydd ymdrechion cystafell ar hyn o bryd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029482_0029852 and you don't need to send very much information.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029852_0030249 Mae'r rhan fwyaf o'r rhain yn cael eu hysbysu gan fath o batri.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030249_0030387 Now all one.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030387_0032173 Nid wyf yn siŵr a ydym am edrych ar y math o broblem oherwydd mae'r mwyaf o ohonoi wedi'u hyfforddi gan batriau AAA, ond gallai'r rhain fod yn eithaf fwy. Felly dydw i ddim yn gwybod a ydych chi eisiau edrych ar rhai eraill, felly gallwn ni ddod o hyd i'r math o broblem.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032173_0032222 Yes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032558_0032617 I'm
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032617_0033253 If you look at most remote controls, they're quite chunky, and that's because of the size of the batteries.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033253_0033769 they have to be obviously this size to fit those batteries in.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033769_0034754 Iawn, ond gallwch ddod at y cyfan cymdeithasol unwaith eto. Rwy'n meddwl am y pwyllgor llawer a pha mor rhaid i chi'w gosod y detriacrus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0034754_0035461 sy'n cynyddu at y pwynt nesaf o fod yn fach a'n haws i'w gyrraedd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0035461_0036032 Yn hyn o bryd, mae'r unau hynny'n fach, ond rwy'n meddwl y gallwn ni edrych ar rhai a fydd yn fach.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036119_0036880 Y ffynonell gwreiddiol y gwnes i oedd y ffwrdd hwnnw i'r batriwmau, oherwydd na fyddai'n mynd i weithio.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036880_0037334 As I said about the which batteries we were going to choose
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0037334_0039212 Gallwch ysgrifennu hyn ymlaen. Yna, mae angen rhai pethau i ddifrifio'r wybodaeth rydych chi'n ei rhoi o'r controlawr i'w dynnu mewn i sylwad o wybodaeth, sy'n mynd i'w defnyddio i'rwyddo'r wybodaeth
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0039212_0040149 Mae hyn yn cael eang o ran ymlaen i 5 metr, sy'n ddefnyddiol i unrhyw un sy'n gwylio'r TV, yn enwedig os ydyn nhw mewn cinema.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040149_0040724 dyna'r cyfrifoldeb, mae'n dweud bod y rhan fwyaf o'r cyfrifoldeb yn ddweud bod hynny'n dda.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040724_0041786 Yna, rydw i wedi gweld y dylunio allanol yn gyflym, ac rydw i wedi'i ddod i'r dylunydd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0041918_0042276 And so this is what I have as the basic idea of what we want to do.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042276_0042828 It's not a proper circuit. I'm not sure if it will work or not.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042828_0043307 I'm not even confident that that's the real way you'd wire it up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0043307_0044180 So we've just got the power going to the infrared bulb, the chip and the UI interface.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044335_0044440 which would basically
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044440_0045351 Yn y bryd, pan fyddwch chi'n gysylltu â pheth, bydd y cip yn ei dynnu i rai ffyrdd o ddata VR, a allai fod yn cael ei ddifrifo gan y cyflogwr TV.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045351_0045881 which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045992_0047240 y gallwn gael ffyrdd o gyfathrebu y mae'r TVau yn defnyddio erbyn hyn, ac er mwyn defnyddio'r infrared, oherwydd dyna beth mae'r TVau'n defnyddio.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047240_0047388 And then finally...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047388_0048772 Rydyn ni eisiau ei gael ar gyfer cymaint o fuddsoddiad ar gael ar gyfer cyllid llawn, felly bydd pob gweithredaeth rydw i wedi'i rhoi yn cyllid llawn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0048772_0049534 It should should be different enough from the alternative products to get good consumer-based
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049534_0049953 we were talking about it before, not just something I was thinking about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049953_0051225 oherwydd maen nhw'n fach, maen nhw hefyd yn haws i'w gael, felly os gallwn ni edrych mewn i rai ffordd i gydnabod rhywbeth sy'n ymwneud â mynd i'r ôl y sofa, y peth y gallwch ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051225_0051707 Dyna'n un o'r pwyntau cyffredinol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051707_0051903 Very important
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0052171_0052865 yeah that's that's what I came up with that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0059548_0059679 function
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0060745_0061098 That's my question.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0078292_0078370 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0082660_0082831 너무 맛있다

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0084009_0084398 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0109929_0110099 Yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110365_0110586 C'est pas du bois, c'est du liquide.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110905_0111510 Ac os oes gennych sgai, un o'r sgai plus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0111510_0112232 gallwch chi recordio'n ddiweddar o'r TV, ar y TV
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0115583_0116633 Felly, fel syniad ar y peth o adnodd y sgwrs, byddai'n eithaf gansoddol i gyfathrebu cyfathrebu sgwrs cyfan, ac nid ydynt yn y peth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0116764_0116844 We also have a new
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0117659_0117763 more for speech...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0118863_0120080 Ond ar hynna eto, rydw i'n meddwl, oherwydd gallwch chi gael y rhain clifoedd yna a'ch gweithredu ac yna bydd yn gadael i'r brif ffwrdd i'ch gwybod pa mor ffyrdd yw. Felly rwy'n meddwl y gallai hynny fod yn dda.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0130630_0131204 Yeah, you could have a number of different designs. I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0131327_0131716 The features could be same and the body could look slightly different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0134069_0134462 Yeah. Computers? Yeah.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138496_0138917 But also ergonomics, as we were saying, of the different designs.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138917_0140603 oherwydd, os oes gennych gweld y Xbox, roedd yn rhaid iddo wneud controllerau o ddifrif o ffyrdd oherwydd nad oedd pobl yng Nghymru yn eu gael oherwydd y controller o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0150192_0151305 I was just thinking about how you can combat that because without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel it becomes...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0151424_0151723 Yeah, that's pretty true. Which is extremely expensive.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0163198_0163315 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0164781_0164911 in a few days time and you're not sure.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165687_0165894 Anything like that is just number.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165894_0166237 And you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0166237_0166555 You've already got the numbers for two.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0167185_0167280 newspaper or TV.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0169347_0169912 It's been around for a long time, it's just it's not very well advertised.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0170330_0171457 Os oes gennych beth fel Skynyway, gallwch ddysgu'r botwm ar y rhaglen unwaith ac mae'n recordio'r rhaglen. Os yw'n arno, ddysgu arno'r rhaglen ddwywaith ac mae'n recordio'r holl seri.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171608_0171863 So yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171863_0172203 Ond mae'r ffynsiwn hwnnw'n bwysig iawn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0177063_0179451 Ond y unig broblem yw bod chi'n cyfrifo ar y ffôn ffobil ar gyfer y cyfrif. Felly mae'r cymdeithasau rydych chi'n ei wneud gyda nhw wedi cael arwainstedth i'ch helpu i ffwrdd. Mae'n ddiddorol iawn i gael rhai ffwrdd o gofal gwyllt, ond dwi ddim yn siŵr sut bydd y cost yn ymwneud â hyn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181345_0181412 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181639_0182014 I mean, instruction books. Instruction manuals.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0182540_0182649 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0184229_0184510 Mae'r ffocwsau'n ddim yn ddim, oherwydd y byddwn yn ymwneud â hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0185403_0185487 It does.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0187956_0188561 ac mae'n gwneud arbennig i'r ffônau cyfansoddol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0188561_0188987 They come with a charger. I mean you could find a charger.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0190909_0191734 Yeah, if you had one of those, just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting up the blimp in the room, that could...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0191928_0192056 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0192552_0192970 Iawn, rhai fel ystafell gofyn. Rydyn ni'n cyfrifol am ystafell gofyn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0193338_0193963 Ie, ie, dyna byddai'n iawn. Ac hefyd, dyna byddai'n golygu nad oes angen mynd allan i gael batrieri'n gyfan y pwyllgor.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0053624_0053899 Maybe with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059104_0059321 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059321_0059379 I see.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060255_0060416 Mm.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060673_0060814 It's good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0061620_0062515 Some of my points might overlap with what William just mentioned. But basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0062515_0063547 This is a very good point.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0063691_0064255 I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064255_0064919 So purpose as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make it as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064919_0065298 and to summarize I would say it should be user friendly by being easy to use
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0065404_0066192 rather than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering driven, maybe having 100 buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066315_0066622 like volume control or changing the channel or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066741_0067462 But we have to make it unique so that people want to buy. We'll punch in these two features together.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067462_0067737 So the concept is to have a flip-top model.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067737_0069035 The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to say program their favorite channels or whatever.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069035_0069351 can be put in the middle part of the flip top.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069351_0070654 So it could be accessed by a wider range of audience. And we can punch in new features, added features such as shock-proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0070826_0072814 findings most people prefer user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they have not used maybe 30 to 40% of the buttons so it's of no use of trying to put in those things on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0072814_0073649 As we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economy of higher production like 50 million we said.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0073649_0074378 Yeah, with that I think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also. So we can add more features and make it less costly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0074762_0075212 that's so this is if you ask me personally I would make a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0075447_0076762 So, we should look at also like the buttons whether they are like soft or little hard because there are times the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0076762_0076903 Jadi, satu-satunya perkara yang mudah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077084_0077176 user-friendly design.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077302_0077469 Any comments?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080345_0080468 There's a bunch of cases here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080544_0080661 You can't.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080727_0080950 You have to disconnect it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081300_0081424 I'm going to push it a bit more.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081928_0082028 I'm just saying.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0112627_0113386 programming. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0114090_0114129 10%.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0130021_0130539 So are we talking of a single model or maybe five, six designs?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0131349_0131665 The features could be same and the body could look slightly different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0142436_0143060 Yeah, maybe to, as it was indicated, the risk for repeated use.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143060_0143427 Maybe a touch screen could be a better option for them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143672_0144196 So you are dividing designs based on not only segment, age group size, but also the number
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144196_0144633 you are dividing it according to the countries also, the market.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144633_0145286 Maybe for US and you can have a slightly bigger remote. And in Japan you need to have a smaller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0153750_0153940 आपको बड़े मकटे के लिए अच्छा लिए आजाएगा
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0154040_0154364 I have seen people between age 20 to 35.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0183560_0184036 I think I made too much of an effort for a person to... for a phone maybe he might walk down the street.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0184036_0184327 But for remote, he will just refer to the background.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0192253_0192616 So are we talking for concept of rechargeable something?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198282_0198846 I was thinking of a design which Nokia came up with almost 6 or 7 years back.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198846_0199279 Basically we have a flat one, it looks like a box, like a chocolate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199279_0199946 that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they come up with something like this, curved up
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199946_0200218 and you don't bend your thumb too much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200218_0200588 So it's like a banana-shaped kind of thing, curved up like a boat.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200744_0201169 So what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like this.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201249_0201901 So it's already curved up. So you can mold it to your hand anyway. So we can have a, like you know, mold it according to your...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201997_0202359 the way you hold it. It's kind of semicircular in the bottom.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0202482_0202746 I wouldn't say exactly, so you're good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0206728_0206856 We could look at that but...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207096_0207273 What we were talking is to make it more...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207410_0207989 You could put a logo in the corner of the model.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207989_0208367 you know trying to make it like a seashell or whatever you are telling me.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0209025_0209098 position.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0211055_0211171 Yeah, we do the benediction.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215455_0215628 Yeah, maybe we could commit some set of files.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215628_0216163 designs and then choose which are which are appeals the most like that could be the most common design.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0216283_0216461 We can think of five, six reasons.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0009477_0009969 o'r cyfarfod diwethaf.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0010104_0011160 This is where we talk about properties, materials, user interface, and trend watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011269_0011501 So I think we've touched on a few things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011664_0011891 to that already but we'll just go over it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012298_0012602 the minutes from last time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012602_0013372 We had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0013372_0014280 it wasn't going to be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0014472_0016044 We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition. We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016044_0016539 we're thinking of Shell, but something along those lines, just different shade from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016897_0017210 You are going to look into the rechargeable batteries.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017331_0017939 and we're going to think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost, things like that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017939_0018862 and our market was going to be young business kind of range.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0018862_0019193 Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0019193_0019284 Yes, if you can.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0024946_0025060 It's true.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0035729_0035965 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036149_0036391 Let's start from the inside and work our way out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036755_0036949 Yeah, it did take some getting used to.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0037104_0037309 Yes, thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0038856_0038972 I hate those little things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0039096_0039596 yn enwedig os ydych chi'n ei wneud ar ddŵr cyflawn, ac nid ydych chi'n gallu cael y cymorth arnynt i ddi-ddiw.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0049745_0049886 Yn siwr, mae pobl yn gweld hynny.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050012_0050260 Right
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050494_0050799 Pa mor llawn allwch chi allu'i ddod allan?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050799_0051223 Gallwch chi ddod at ei gilydd, ychydig munud, ac yna dyna'r diwrnod ar y noth?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053146_0053294 when he's got a teacher.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053378_0053790 Alright
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053961_0054086 Any, any...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0055701_0055969 I'm pretty sure the seller is from the South.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056054_0056835 dwi ddim yn meddwl bod angen llwybrau arall. Ond dwi'n meddwl nad yw'n rhaid i chi gyrraedd eich
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056835_0057300 I mean people who live in basement flats, there's not that many people. But there are people.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058059_0058272 But then it would be charging to the day
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058272_0058872 Ie, rwy'n credu bod y pwynt yn y bydd yn cael ei dynnu drwy'r dydd ac yna mae'n cael ei dynnu drwy'r dydd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0059540_0059632 Yeah, I think so.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064002_0064729 But then if you think about a watch, it's on your wrist, so it's on your body the whole time. So you're walking around.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064729_0065014 of doing things. It is moving a lot of the time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065014_0065289 I mean you switch the TV on and you put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065289_0065588 Yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065588_0065718 then again
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0068177_0068398 No
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0069823_0069960 Don't you?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071616_0071774 expensive as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071774_0072311 ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0074029_0074161 The song
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075002_0075156 Yeah, right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075916_0076308 Mae'n dweud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080189_0080629 Okay, can we add in an attachment to clothing feature?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080799_0080978 Can we think about that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080978_0081433 Iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0081629_0081912 Rydyn ni'n mynd i ddod at ei ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082370_0082509 Where am I?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082509_0084553 If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do, kind of, we're doing something original and different, but if you wore it, if it's something you could just clip on your pocket, then you would have that less
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084553_0084817 you wouldn't lose it. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084951_0085271 but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0085412_0085659 the eternal battle for control of the cosmos.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0087163_0087235 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091816_0091988 What kind of things do we have to consider there?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091988_0092807 Can we, what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size? And we would have to fit the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0111147_0111276 for the flip side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117621 So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0117621_0118084 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddweud y penau sydd gennych gyda'r grip, y gallwch eu gwneud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0118872_0119263 Although it's been really popular with my girlfriend, so I don't see why not.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0129140_0129293 Oh, roedd e'n ddiflanno.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131235_0131449 I think it would be good to have a contrast between
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131449_0132237 If the whole thing is going to be this rubber thing, it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0132237_0132764 Now how would you distinguish, if you had it bare, how would you distinguish where you had to press?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0134328_0134463 So you could plan around.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0135045_0135233 Mae'n ddiddorol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137437_0137923 Okay, we'll talk about that so if you finish here and we'll come back to that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137923_0138131 Diolch yn fawr iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144155_0144495 We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144866_0144989 Well, it's a remote control.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144989_0145772 you're sitting watching TV yeah are you gonna want to sort of open it and say
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0145952_0146152 Iawn, dwi'n meddwl.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0148283_0148597 I can't see.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0155824_0155938 ग्राफिक पीड़ा
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0160946_0161428 Can we swap that round to the ones that we use our timer on the bottom part?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161564_0161743 if you think you've got a fold against.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161877_0162283 You would be using your thumbs to press? Just like a mobile phone?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0163533_0164442 Iawn, ond dyna'r hyn rydw i'n ei ddweud. Ac yna gall y cyfnod ymlaen gael y topog, ac yna gallwch ddechrau ymlaen at hynny ar gyfer y rhai eraill.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0164442_0165203 have the volume and the program things like that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0175745_0176007 I can't see, it's like playing stuff and things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0176145_0176343 Oh, is that volume and channel?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0179203_0179843 I'm not sure how long I've got left, but we need to make a decision about...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180107_0180200 the things we discussed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180270_0180650 So we agree on...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180781_0180899 Do we agree on the battery?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181306_0181831 And that means that there's no function for the port.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181831_0182425 you know that sits in the present button and having so we could incorporate voice recognition yeah i'm pointing it i mean
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182425_0182687 It's like a gadget.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182807_0182892 selling point.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0184800_0184921 I think the only...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185031_0185833 Rwy'n credu bod yr unig ddifrifold a fyddwn ni'n ei wneud yw pa mor mwy mae'n rhaid ei gosod. Os yw hynny'n golygu ein bod ni'n rhaid i ni ddod allan mewn lle eraill.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185833_0186520 Ond rwy'n credu'n dda iawn, rydyn ni wedi defnyddio pethau'n ddifrifol ac yn ddifrifol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0186520_0186655 as it is not chilled.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0187652_0187765 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0188079_0188197 I knew that would be good.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0189165_0189312 Do you want like a back up?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191274_0191588 Okay, so I forgot the battery.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191588_0192062 The inside components are pretty standardised across the board, isn't it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192189_0192592 felly nid oes yna ddecisiwn i'w wneud yno.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192808_0193128 The buttons, what did you give us?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0193474_0193716 the bare board LCD.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0194471_0194948 on the top one, okay you've got the touch, okay and then
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0195625_0195847 Okay. Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0197336_0197415 Нет.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0198156_0198256 for the inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0199200_0199392 I don't think so.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0200704_0201858 No, I think we don't want to be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway. The fact that the material that we would be using would be cheap.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0201858_0202008 So we could make it red.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202008_0202770 We could make it psychedelic. We could make it black and white zebra stripes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202770_0203384 Ond dyna ddim yn unig beth rydym yn cymryd ynghylch beth rydym yn cymryd yw'r... Y fath. Ie.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0203384_0203662 So we could just pick anything.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0205521_0206423 I mean, I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses, and I'm trying to imagine a house
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0206423_0207105 sort of beige and black. Do you either want something that goes with that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207105_0207294 which is what's on the market anyway.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207294_0208360 or you want something that contrasts as, you know, like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0209428_0210011 and you would just have so many different options that you could do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0210011_0210708 You could have a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0211630_0212456 Yr un sydd â'rchydau rhaglenni, fe allwch chi mynd yn fawr â hyn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0212456_0213177 like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so I think that's quite good flexible
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0215226_0215710 Okay, I've got five minutes. Erm... Oh, that might have been it for a while.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0222133_0222216 I love you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0223557_0224476 Wel, maen nhw'n gwneud hynny, ond rwy'n credu y gallwn... Wel, mae'n ymwneud â'r cymdeithas. Wel, mae, mae. Rwy'n credu y gallwch chi ddweud hynny gyda'r adroddiadau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0224476_0225035 you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225035_0225419 Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225419_0226057 The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently. But I think it does without that, so I'm not worried about that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0226877_0227640 depending on how yeah depending on the expense of it i mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into so
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0227763_0228698 that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive and we'd have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0228698_0229151 But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229151_0229325 Right? I'm going to wrap this up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229632_0230258 Mae gen i'r cyfarfod ar gyfer y cyfarfod nawr!
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0230519_0231255 So I think we've probably got, it says closing, we have 40 minutes. So I think we probably got about that time before we come back.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231436_0231523 It's either that or.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231623_0232110 We only had 40 minutes to discuss what we just discussed. I don't know how long that took.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0232570_0232677 Is everyone happy?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0001757_0001913 Thank you for watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019124_0019210 Yeah.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029974_0030639 mae'n ddwyfais mor bwysig na'r ddau, Technolegol Newydd, sydd yn ystod ddwyfais mor bwysig na'r defnyddio'n haws.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0030783_0031218 felly efallai y bydd y ffeitio y byddwn yn ei wneud yn gyntaf yn wirioneddol yn bwysig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031218_0031695 Mae'n rhan o orfod prefferan ar y subject rydyn ni wedi'i edrych ar.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031695_0032413 Yn ysgolion, mae'r newid cyflawni sy'n ymwneud â phreferendau personol yn ein grŵp sylw.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0032413_0033086 Fe wnaethom ddod o'n cyswlltant ym Milan, a gweithiodd yn y ffasiwn a'r dylunio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033086_0033505 bydd y frwyd a'r ffrawn yn y theimlad ar gyfer traws, sioe a chyfarch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033505_0033912 So she could be thinking of using something like that in a remote control design too.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034013_0034785 Mae hefyd yn debyg bod cyfnod ar gyfer materiolaethau sy'n ffodus, yn ogystal â chyfnod y flwyddyn diwethaf.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034785_0035432 Mae yna ddod o ddynion ddiddorol, o ran y departamentau ddysgau market ac ar ran ein bobl yng Nghymru a Llanellan.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0035432_0035654 It'll be interesting to see what our design people make of that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036543_0036742 if anyone has any questions about that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036742_0036901 I'm on the other two, thanks.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0039387_0039590 I'm going to try not to say undo.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053232_0053491 I'm not sure just if someone's...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053491_0053571 Bye.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053916_0053999 Any
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056191_0056303 Electric lines.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056527_0056624 That's not the way it is.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0057116_0057532 But there are people.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0068504_0069132 I'm going to be strong. Referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069132_0069148 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069148_0069726 gallai bobl dod â batriau cyffredinol, ond gallai'r cyflwyniadau eu gosod yn y llun, ond mae'r ddau pethau'n ddifrifol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0071449_0071648 Diolch yn fawr.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0076735_0076799 And the question is.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0079650_0080160 Iawn, rwy'n credu ei fod yn eithaf dda.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0081231_0081853 A allwn ni wneud ymchwil ar hynny'n gyntaf, cyn i ni ddod o hyd i mewn? Dwi'n meddwl y byddwn yn dod o hyd i mewn i feddwl amdano.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0085715_0086369 It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and larger researches.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086484_0086645 and we throw it open to the field.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086804_0087020 Iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115209_0115444 It doesn't hurt either if you let it fall.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115444_0115944 Mae'n dweud bod y cyfnod yn dweud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115944_0116500 I was just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that's... Rubber, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0116500_0116979 gallwch chi ei ddweud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0117431_0117601 of the freedom of I.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0118463_0118836 Yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128514_0128876 hefyd gyda'r
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128876_0129431 Os oes gennym ddangos, er enghraifft, oeddwn yn gallu cael sgrin lleth ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0129595_0129708 But I'm just wondering whether.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0132981_0133449 Iawn, dwi am ddweud un arall sy'n helpu hwnnw, ond unwaith i'r RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133449_0133915 Yn ystod y cyfle, gall pobl ddefnyddio eu ffingur i ddysgu'r botwm.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133915_0134516 or we have inside a small pointer thing. Yeah, you can have some sort of star that you could fill out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0135041_0135232 Rydyn ni'n cael ei ddweud gyda'r rhai sy'n ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0136802_0137175 oedd yn dweud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0137175_0137398 pencil or pen, so it wouldn't be a needer.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141328_0141902 I just raised another problem that occurs to me. It kind of applies to both our designers here, to not sure how it would fit in.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141902_0142008 If we flip open
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142008_0142721 Now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142721_0142795 You see those?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142893_0143138 ac maen nhw'n ymateb i ddiwrnod eich bod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0143138_0144102 Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell, it's a little compact mirror, and when you press a button, it then goes onto the phone display, the remote control display?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144533_0144638 They don't look at themselves.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144773_0144835 Just a thought.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145341_0145424 然后一些
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145424_0146099 I'm going to have a shower and do my hair before I put the tea on.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0146202_0146611 Rydyn ni'n ceisio feddwl am ffeisiau eraill y gallwn eu hadneud yn ddim yn costio llawer ond byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud hynny ar y sôn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0148117_0148530 Mae'n ddiddorol i ni ddweud hynny, ond mae'n ddiddorol iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0155760_0155881 Sorry, what was that story?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162257_0162492 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162703_0162747 Vous n'y êtes pas ?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162747_0162868 I didn't like the idea.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162868_0163243 Os ddefnyddwch y siol fel enghraifft, gallwch ei ofyn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0163243_0163660 Mae gennych chi'r ddisplay LCD yno a mae'r botwm yn yno, yn eich gwybod?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0188370_0188958 Iawn. Rydyn ni'n siarad am ffocws caniatig, ond mae'n deimlo ein bod ni wedi penderfynu ar hynny. A oes gennym ni ddeimlo ar faterion OEEE?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0189425_0190016 Yn ystod y penderfyniad rydyn ni'n rhaid ei wneud oedd y byddwn ni'n cael batreau double oed a triple oed, oherwydd mae'r rhain yn rhaid iddo fod yn cael eu hymysgu yma.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190016_0190091 Come on.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190507_0190607 All right, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190840_0191062 Mae eich bod chi ar hynny hefyd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0195977_0196170 Felly, a allwch chi ei gyflawni ar y cyfan diwethaf?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0196365_0196464 So, let's play.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0198820_0199377 Felly, rydyn ni'n penderfynu ar y casglu rhagl ar gyfer y sioe plastig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0199597_0200180 Mae'n bwysig iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0200180_0200831 nid ydych chi'n mynd i'w brofi a gwneud mewn gwirionedd dylunio o ffrwyt neu unrhyw beth eraill yn y sioe?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203180_0203228 Let's see.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203764_0204429 Ydy hwn yn mynd i fod yn dynion i mi o raim o ffyrdd, ychydig o ffyrdd,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204429_0204917 made of plastic, fits into the palm of the hand, rubberised cover that's spongy.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204917_0205635 a yw hynny wir yn mynd i ddod â gweld a chael ymdrechion, sy'n beth mawr y bydd pobl eisiau?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208230_0208684 Iawn, rydw i'n mynd i'w gyrraedd, ond rydw i'n credu ei fod wedi dod allan o unrhyw beth eraill, ond rydw i'n cydnabod hynny'n unig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208684_0209080 Rydyn ni wedi edrych ar y gymunedau, rydyn ni'n unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0209080_0209463 Byddai hyn yn wahanol iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210551_0210871 Do you think that other radio covers are going to be so relatively cheap to produce?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210871_0211662 Yn ystod y blynyddoedd, os ydyn ni'n cael cymorth o'r ffyrdd dylunio, mae pethau eraill yn dod. Mae'n eithaf hwyr i ni gynhyrchu hynny, a gallai'n cael ei ddod yn ôl.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0211662_0211788 Pois não tem.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0215644_0216382 for a while. So can I just recap there, still, of the decisions that we've made for kinetic charging for watch-type batteries?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216382_0216871 ymlaen, y ddisglai LCD ar y ddechrau o'r fflip,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216871_0217586 rubberised buttons on the bottom side. I'm going to use food and vegetable colours for the rubber cover. The case itself is plastic.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0217586_0217853 So far we've got Wales to have to our decisions.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219094_0219334 felly rwy'n gobeithio y byddai'n gweithio'n dda.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219334_0219636 Ond mae'n syniad da, mae'n rhaid i ni ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0221703_0221964 I'm incorporating the company logo.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0222656_0223061 Roeddwn i'n siarad â'r adroddiadau a gafodd ar y cyfarfod diwethaf o'ch adroddiad.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223061_0223585 Mae'n ddiddorol iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223838_0224119 You can't say it's kind on the market. Well, it is. It is.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226150_0226432 Yn y cyfarfod diwethaf, sônwn ni am adbwynt B.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226432_0226842 I think that was you talked about a deep referral location and we just rejected that in favour of the last recognition.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0230669_0230756 It says closing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0009601_0009826 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0036429_0036582 Yep.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0038097_0038352 That's cool.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0041188_0042252 Mae hwn yn ymwneud â'r dylunio o'r componentau a'r cyfleoedd o'r componentau rydyn ni'n eu cymryd ar hyn o bryd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042252_0042507 Okay, first, the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042623_0042742 into the math.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042742_0043948 Yr syniad arall o'r cyfan yw, i gyd, ddysgu'r botwmau ac mae'n rhaid eu cyflawni ar y TV, ac fe wnaethom ni drafod yn ystod ein cyfarfod diwethaf, a byddai'n eithaf hwnnw i'w ddod o hyd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0043948_0044473 Also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0044473_0045055 oherwydd rhai o'r pethau rydyn ni wedi'u edrych ar y tro cyntaf, yn amlwg, nid yw'n canfod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045266_0045596 findings, I've got my nice little picture there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045596_0046596 Dyma'r chip yw TA11835, sy'n cael ei ddefnyddio yn pob control arall, oherwydd mae'n cyflwyno cyfnodau arbennig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0046596_0047486 Mae'r cyfrifiadau yma'n dilyn eich cyfrifiadau ac mae'n ddefnyddiol i gyd i gyd i'r TV.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047486_0047853 Ac yna, rydyn ni'n edrych ar ffurfiau batri.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047986_0048454 Nid oes peth arall i'w gysylltu.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0048454_0049370 Felly, roeddwn i'n gweld y standard, AA a AAA, sy'n ein bod ni'n meddwl oedd yn ddifrifol iawn ar hyn o bryd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0049370_0050219 It's basically like wind-up radio, right? Okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050219_0050626 So you've lined up your own control before you use it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050626_0050702 هل
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051215_0051688 Yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it for very long.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051688_0052412 ond dwi ddim yn meddwl bod hynny'n anodd iawn pan fyddwch chi'n meddwl y ddau ddau pethau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0052412_0053316 fel y sobr yma, oherwydd mae'r mwyaf o bobl yn cael y llawn ar y ffordd y byddwn ni'n cael
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053691_0053742 is that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053742_0053910 All right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055103_0055725 Ie, byddai'r dynamo'n cymryd mwy o fawr o achos bydd angen i'r cyflawniau ffysigol i'w gysylltu.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055977_0056085 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0057514_0058039 Ie, ac mae'r mwyaf o bobl yn dweud gwylio TV yn y ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0058725_0059062 Felly rwy'n credu bod y nesaf yn y bwysig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059062_0059834 ymchwil cysylltiadol, sy'n gwneud eich bod chi'n cael ei gael yn y rhifau rhwydweithiau, ac eich bod chi ddim yn sylwi
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059834_0060386 I mean the amount of property moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0060386_0060805 Dydw i ddim yn meddwl y byddwch chi'n hoffi'n dda iawn i wneud y peth honno'n ddigon dda.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0061351_0062662 Ie, mae'n cael argyfwng i rai ffyrdd, mae'n llun fwyaf o ffyrdd y mae'n cael argyfwng i, ac mae'r ffyrdd o fath o batriweraeth
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062662_0062874 because they use them quite frequently in watches.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062874_0064041 ac mae'r ddau'n golygu... Wel, dwi ddim yn siŵr iawn pa mor ddau byddai'n golygu, ond dwi ddim wedi gweld un yn mynd allan.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0064990_0065140 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0065538_0066039 yet
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0066039_0067333 Er bod yna unig amser, mae'n mynd ymlaen i'r diwrnod hwnnw, ac nid ydyn nhw'n mynd allan yn ystod y noth pan rhaid eu gadael nhw ar y sgwrs.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067333_0067624 ac ar y pryd yw'r un pryd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067624_0068678 Ac efallai y byddwch chi'n defnyddio'r cyfle ar gyfer amser anhygoel iawn i'w ddysgu'r cyfle, ac yna byddwch chi'n digwydd â'r cyfle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0069582_0070774 y ddau ddynion ddim yn gyfartal? Ie, fe allwch chi gael ddau ddynion, ond y peth gyda'r cellau solaer yw efallai y byddwch chi'n ei bod yn rhaid iddo eu rhoi ar y cas, oherwydd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0070774_0071499 Os ydych chi ar y calculator, maen nhw'n eithaf fawr ac maen nhw'n edrych yn unigol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0071725_0071915 Mae'n ddangos bod y cyfleoedd yn ddangos y cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd yn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0072299_0073132 Yn ystod y cyfrifiadau, bydd y batriau normal yn y cyffredin.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073243_0073799 dwi'n credu eu bod nhw ddim yn eithaf agored i'w ddod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073799_0074827 Oherwydd os ydych chi'n dod, iawn, os ydych chi'n cael y ffyrdd yr hoffech chi ei ariannu, byddai'r remote ddim yn eithaf fawr, ond dwi'n golygu os yw'r remote bob amser yn cael ei ddod o gwmpas a phethau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0074990_0075189 Yeah, practically.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0075365_0076057 I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot, whereas remotes you do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0076239_0076697 Ie, maen nhw'n cael bethau mewn dŵr ond mae'r batrieri'n fwy fawr.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077618_0077833 Yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077962_0078479 Yeah, if you had something using the standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078600_0078967 Mae'r batri'n sain yn cael ei ddefnyddio'n hir.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078967_0079783 Dw i ddim yn credu eich bod chi'n credu eich bod chi'n gwybod pa mor llaen y bydd y double A oedd yn digwydd yn y llyfr oedd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0079932_0080195 Yeah, I think it would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087220_0087329 Let's say we're all here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087485_0088899 Y rhan ddegol o'r cyfnodau rwy'n ei wneud, mae'r cyfnodau cyffredinol mwyaf sy'n defnyddio'r pwrdd cyfrifiadur PCV silicon hwn, sy'n cynllunio pwrdd cyfrifiadur.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0088899_0089550 which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0089550_0091768 bydd yn cysylltu â'r cwrs, ac mae pob swydd yn cysylltu â gwahanol legell ar y cip, ac felly mae'n rhoi adroddiad gwahanol. Ac mae hynny'n cael ei ddatblygu gan y cip i mewn i codi, ac yna mae'n cael ei fflwyo allan o'r LED yn ymgysylltu o ffyrdd ond yn allan.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0092714_0093013 Q. Well, the thing about it is...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0093157_0094354 gallant fod yn fwy neu'n fwy iawn fel yr hoffwch eu bod, oherwydd gallwch gysylltu cyrff cyffredin fel hyn. Mae'n debygol o le fel hyn, felly gallwch gael fath o fath o ffyrdd o'r nain o'r botwmau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094354_0094603 if you see how thin the tracks are
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094603_0095211 gallwch eu rhoi'n ymdrechol yn y blynyddoedd ar y rhai arall ac gan swydd fwy fawr ar unrhyw un.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0095211_0096216 os oes gennych amlwg. Ond mae cyfle i wneud hynny fel hyn, neu gallwch gael rhai
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096359_0096753 ar y cyfnod nesaf.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096908_0097666 Yn ystod y cyfnod hwn, i gael y llwybrau'n barod, mae'n rhaid i'r amgylchedd fod yn ystafell arferol, yn hytrach na'i ddefnyddio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0097666_0098463 Rwy'n meddwl am hynny oherwydd weithiau pan mae gennych y pethau hyn maen nhw'n golygu llawer o'r ôl y botwmau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0098463_0099218 felly gallwch weld beth mae'r botwmau yn eich bod chi'n gwneud yn fwy o'r amser rydw i wedi'i wneud ar y remote TV
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099218_0099999 but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like 5 or 10 seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099999_0100304 os ydym wedi ddechrau mynd i bwysau a allai eu llunio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0100491_0101417 Mae'r adnoddau cas yn cael eu hysbysu yn yr ystafell y gall y ffactoriad ddod i ni.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0101417_0102327 Mae'r plastig, sy'n fy meddwl ein bod ni'n mynd i mewn i mewn, yw'r casgliad arbennig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0102459_0103250 y broblemau sylweddol gyda'r, wel, gallwch fynd i fodd, ond rwy'n credu byddai'n ddiddorol iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0103250_0104324 titanium, very expensive, just the process to make it is expensive, and rubber,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0104324_0105188 Well you're saying that people like this spongy feel, so perhaps something made of rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105188_0105650 but I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105785_0106024 that they've put across.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106153_0106991 yw'r hyn sy'n cael ei ddefnyddio mewn gwirionedd anodd ac mae'n rhaid i fod yn anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106991_0107867 I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0107867_0108482 and the problem with the casing is that there's
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0108608_0109417 mae cyfansoddau dylunio yn llawn ar y ffordd o'r casgliadau
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109417_0109818 If you go for titanium, they can only do a standard box shape.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109818_0110496 yn ystod y byddwch chi'n dod i'r plastig, gallant wneud ffurfion cyrff.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0110496_0110920 But whether or not because we have it in two separate units.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0111136_0111242 So the flip side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112321_0112383 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112823_0113240 Yeah, in titanium I don't think it would be available at all really.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113240_0113765 just it would well you could make it available in the titanium
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113765_0114170 It was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0114170_0115100 because of the expense of how much titanium is. It's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115243_0115311 Sure.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115672_0115851 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116388_0116511 Robert? Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116863_0117008 And she can peel them off, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0119373_0120482 Yn ôl i'r defnyddio'r defnyddwyr gyda'r botwmau, roeddwn i'n cynllunio rhai sgrimau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0120482_0121957 Now what I was saying before about instead of having, you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and say just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122071_0122465 os oes gennych nhw'n dda sut, byddai hynny'n pwysica.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122465_0122835 The second option they offer rubber buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122835_0123831 but I thought that an LCD type of screen, because one, they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0123831_0124958 Two, you can have them in an array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a set. You could have them like a touch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125432_0125558 Uh, what?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125910_0127015 Oh on the LCD screen, you could fit it, the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curved things with it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127015_0127827 but you wouldn't have, with the LCD, you'd have the wires coming off. You wouldn't have that with the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127940_0128210 With the LCD you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0128504_0128659 Tosu, bu ne?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129264_0129906 gallwch gael sgrin lleth yno, ie, ond rwy'n cwestiynu os ydym am sgrin LCD yno.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129906_0130571 It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white. But there'd be touch, touch buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0130571_0131188 felly byddwch chi ddim yn gysylltu. Neu gallwn gael botwmau rhwbeth sy'n cael eu gwneud o'r material hwn, sy'n anti-rsi.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0131618_0131678 I'm going to be like...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0132839_0133139 Yeah, I hadn't really thought that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134130_0134192 Yeah, he too.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134192_0135048 gallwch gael rhai ffyrdd o ffynonellau y gallwch eu llenwi allan, ond rwy'n credu y gallant ddod yn hwyl i'r gwbl yn eithaf eithaf'n llwyr.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0136768_0136855 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0137738_0138096 Yeah, that's the end.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0138991_0139069 Oh yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139363_0139573 Yeah, yeah, that would be fairly simple.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139573_0140740 I mean you'd actually have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or some cabling between them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0140740_0141112 Because in the actual flip, you'd have some linking.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0146938_0147093 I mean you could do it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147093_0147921 gallwch gael... oherwydd os ddechrauwch y carth fwyaf drwy ddisglai LCD neu'n hollol blancio'n ffwrdd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147921_0148233 But I didn't know if you could get any mirror effect on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0156418_0156912 Yeah, if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this LCD screen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0163508_0163805 Dyna'r hyn rydw i'n ei ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0174354_0174537 Well, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182295_0182473 Yeah, I think...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182707_0183573 Ie, mae'n ffeithiol iawn i'w gael, ac hefyd os ydyn nhw wedi cael y rhain y deunyddau yn ystod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0183573_0184148 then it won't be cheap to remanufacture. It will be cheap to remanufacture.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184148_0184662 So do you reckon that's a good idea? Where's the remote? I'm here thing.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184662_0184793 I think that was a big fall for them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0186500_0187432 Mae'n ddim yn gres iawn. Wel, nid yw'n mor gres iawn na'r byddai'n cael ei gael yn fwy cyffredin, oherwydd os oes gennym un arall yn neu'n gweithio'n fwy cyffredin.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0187432_0187668 They use them in calculators.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189054_0189228 What?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189926_0190502 Na, mae'r cenedlaethau cenedlaethol yn dod â batri sy'n mynd i'r gwarch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0190615_0190857 felly mae'n ddifrifol iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0193636_0194134 I think remote we're going for the LCD on the buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0194134_0194770 ar y, ar y, ar y, ar y dda. Ar y dda, iawn, mae gennych chi'r sgwrs. Iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0195004_0195515 On the bottom we're going to have the rubber, the anti-ISO ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0196178_0197020 Iawn, mae gen i'r sgrin gweithio. Mae'r un o'r dde i'w gael y LCD, ac mae'r un o'r dde i'w gael y rhagorwch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0198019_0198162 plastic
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0200605_0200649 She's a good girl.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0212137_0212251 You could just go.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0214132_0215132 Yeah, yeah, with these rubber, these rubberized, not the actual plastic outside case, just the rubber.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0220154_0220323 Oh yeah, yeah, I wish so.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0226986_0227165 Yeah, depending on the expense of it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0227609_0227779 I've got these thoughts.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0229935_0229994 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0008247_0008327 You appreciate it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0036430_0036499 Yep.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054083_0054598 So, we will be considering the size of the material.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054598_0055216 So maybe it's standard AAA might take less space while Dynamo might take more space.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0060854_0061353 It's like what is the life of the kinetic battery? It runs for a long time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0064027_0064066 and if you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0071528_0071765 Expensive as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0072058_0072205 Are you in the normal bathroom?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076724_0076992 And the question is like, so.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076992_0077461 Which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be like, you know charging like a mobile phone every day
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0077596_0077934 Sorry about the control mic. So, we will just look at the light also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111124_0111763 So it flips right? And second question is like, mobile you can change the cover? Cover the skin or whatever?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111763_0112363 So in this case, if you're looking at like the customer can change the color like from green, parrot green to chili red or something like that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0112363_0112923 Is that feature available in Titanium or it's only specific to Plasma?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117608_0117718 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117973_0118068 That could be a good idea.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0118192_0118395 It would be comfortable to hold on.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125060_0125310 So I can do my last part.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125566_0125997 just what you said I didn't get the meaning of it completely.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0134989_0135328 I believe you want to give the video to the players as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0135328_0136485 A person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use it. And he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0136485_0136741 if you keep punching with point over over.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138042_0138503 We are guarding the circuit since we are having a flip top.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138503_0139147 We have customized the two circuits for different type of buttons. Like we are keeping the standard buttons at the top.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0139147_0139304 So, we can divide the circuit like this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148592_0148738 Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148998_0149237 I wanted to share something which I did here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149237_0149677 First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous bedding.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149677_0150290 especially for the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150290_0150802 Second is we checked into competitors. The picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150802_0151570 So you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy, they are bored of black and white.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0151570_0152116 So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152292_0152729 And second thing is there is too much of confusion here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152729_0152905 इसके लिए नहीं पर्टिकलोर रिमोट पर प्रशाद है
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153118_0153286 like some people have
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153441_0153591 Heal you see this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153591_0153741 This is on iPad.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153858_0154292 I found that the only common feature is the channel control and the volume control.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154292_0154798 whereas other buttons are very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154928_0155214 and second as already discussed with William.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0155214_0156212 We are going to have a GUI interface in the middle of the flip-top and a graphic user interface, basically which is what we do in computer.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156212_0156505 have icons or touchpad over the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156891_0157538 like you have on a, icons are something you have, is a good example of GUI, Graphic User Interface.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0157634_0157921 So basically a person need not point or click on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158012_0158431 press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158431_0159281 On the top, repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing could be on the pointing device, that means user button.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159281_0159776 So he did not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfing.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159878_0160312 So we are having a combination of both. So on the simpler board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0160312_0160780 On the top, we have this button, rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164344_0164499 Okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164949_0165076 On the lower.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165076_0165165 Oh, thanks.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165562_0165774 So the findings are too many cluttered buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165863_0166384 The repetition of certain patterns which I have already explained, for example the volume and channel control buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166384_0166613 all are confusing and inconsistent.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166613_0166912 Okay, we had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a male
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167049_0167557 which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167557_0168273 We have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0168273_0169125 But for like we had a response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169125_0169527 So it could be like, where is the remote? And the remote answers, I am here. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169527_0170446 some kind of thing or it gives a bleak sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170446_0170664 and technologically innovative also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170898_0171243 So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0171623_0172153 My personal preferences would be like, as already highlighted by marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172153_0172555 they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172555_0173179 But yeah, we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors, red chili.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0173301_0174236 to
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0174609_0175151 I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0175151_0175720 So we would not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176016_0176429 This is the central one. Oh, it's that volume and channel.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176429_0177106 So keep that standardized because that's the most common feature across all models. If you look at all the models, it's here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0178082_0178157 voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0181014_0181081 Canada.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0187746_0187925 Maybe we could start with the black and white.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0188073_0188307 Yeah, that would be good. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197144_0197260 And for the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197709_0198266 For the body design I think plastic. Plastic? Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0198266_0198782 for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grips or something like to add to the design.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0199172_0199264 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0205544_0205727 Just different.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0212288_0212491 So, like a...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213084_0213742 Finally the body should be detachable, you can change the body of the case.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213742_0214102 It should be molded with the design in such a way you can change it every time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0214919_0214966 out there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0218025_0218991 We are talking of voice recognition also because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate a remote control if it is lost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219083_0219306 So I'm looking at it like this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219578_0219981 Or maybe like William was suggesting in the last thing, some devices you put on keychains.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220136_0220425 Oh yeah, yeah, the whistle. The whistle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220425_0220813 So we can financially voice recognition is not visible. We could go for a whistle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0222260_0222540 So, we will be incorporating in the design.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0230257_0230355 Again, a question now.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0232171_0232396 I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0000368_0000686 If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0001995_0002074 It's not that big.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002393_0002526 Dwi'n cael fy nghymryd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002738_0002856 Okay, now switch to...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003272_0003390 You were good to go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003390_0003552 Iawn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003664_0003952 minutes. We decided to use a kinetic charger.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004093_0004564 standard chip because it can come in various different sizes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004709_0004997 That's going to be a problem factor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004997_0005194 We wanted a standby function.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005194_0005672 The case interiors can be soft, rubbery, changeable.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005672_0006122 buttons with a combination of LCD and rubber according to the design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006122_0006812 Bright funky designs inspired by a cute thing with a hip kind of feel.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006812_0007631 and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we find out more about the cost of things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0007631_0008203 and the rubber buttons that we use will be anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0008858_0009029 Prototype presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0009260_0009381 I think that would be you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010325_0010586 Make sure I can hold it like...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010901_0010995 Yes, yes you can.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010995_0011086 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012537_0012988 I'm just going to take it off.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012988_0013135 Bye!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0014172_0014215 Oh, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0020953_0021050 and the fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0021493_0021601 Oh right, I'm doing it again.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0023326_0023877 So put it in the top section rather than the bottom section because it's the top.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027237_0027350 I'm under the sofa.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027464_0027593 I know, if you tickle.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0032909_0032972 はい、次
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033289_0033662 I actually knew it would be in touch with the engine. Yeah, on the front side of that, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033662_0033840 Alright
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033980_0034152 That's certainly not good, isn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0034235_0034335 I hope that video makes sense.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0039904_0040303 but not interfering with that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041343_0041510 Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041653_0041912 Just wrapping it on that, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041912_0042199 I've now got evaluation criteria.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0042707_0043170 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0045226_0045415 It's quite similar to what it was before though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0058297_0058533 Just right smiling.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0060141_0060204 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0063692_0063765 I would agree.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0064951_0065004 I'll see you tomorrow.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0069602_0069659 a two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0072117_0072286 It's just 2.5 for that one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0075853_0076076 I would say a two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0076076_0076158 I'm just going to say it to you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077244_0077443 1.7 billion is my analysis.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077443_0077562 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0087136_0087889 Well the type of button that we're going to use in the bottom half, the material, for
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088191_0088855 Maybe because it's like with the size that we've got, it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it, it isn't that much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088855_0089231 So maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089313_0089572 Okay, accurately, the buttons in between.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089572_0089900 It's quite obvious, just big buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0095822_0095902 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096148_0096209 It would be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096383_0096845 And if you didn't hear it in the room you were standing in and you realized it wasn't in that room, you go into another room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102140_0102218 I didn't think so.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102431_0102558 I shake me yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102558_0102627 I take it for granted.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0103784_0104040 too much apart from having a huge big
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105024_0105081 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105433_0105566 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106383_0106722 Okay, I've got finance here now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106722_0107058 I'm going to plug this in so you can all see it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111261_0111373 Now I presume
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111556_0111672 That scream of mine.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111791_0111963 that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0112668_0113201 We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113201_0113484 So are we still on for kinetic?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113715_0113995 See, it would have been handy to have this at the beginning.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113995_0114217 it might have influenced our choice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0114509_0114789 Right, what's happening with the electronics?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0115794_0115886 Vallahi öyle.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117120 Oh, right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117520_0117628 So we could be too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117973_0118028 One chip.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119130_0119210 one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119730_0119868 So what's the single curve?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0120288_0120438 So just one Java.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0121644_0122034 We've got plastic and rubber, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0123290_0123329 you think?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0124483_0124648 It would be like saying we're using...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125074_0125261 See it says case material.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125385_0125843 So we're not actually using plastic in the case?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125843_0126008 It's including, it's more than.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0127840_0128124 Okay, we'll just put it in his hair.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128357_0128636 We should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128938_0129220 I'm going to go down to the front of your ears.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129220_0129394 Okay, special color. You need that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129643_0129734 to the average.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138235_0138315 あ、そうです
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138315_0138673 Oh no, it was 7-5, it's changed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0139863_0140057 It's not calculated.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140280_0140355 Okay, there we go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140434_0140639 Good morning.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0141642_0141956 We haven't been dealing with dollars though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142112_0142400 Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142723_0142945 If we try...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146296_0146349 Where's the...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146444_0146567 Where's the vice-recognition?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146864_0146956 Right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147212_0147361 Well, the kinetic is three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147361_0147641 If we change it to batteries, that's minus three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148023_0148079 All right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148079_0148241 Keep seeing things.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148868_0149309 We can do it some other way, it doesn't have to be voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0149309_0150037 we could do the voice recognition for business class or something, like an upgraded version.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0150037_0150218 you could choose to have them not.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0151326_0151659 So should we just change it to a specification thing?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154493_0154605 Okay, we can...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154748_0155625 gwneud y gwasanaeth a yna dweud os byddwn ni'n gynnal ein budget byddwn ni wedi cael hynny oherwydd mae hefyd yn sefydlu'r rhan o'r gwasanaeth
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0155625_0156026 They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156026_0156347 It's something completely different associated with your company.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156347_0156467 Right, okay, so.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157505_0157721 Was it 12?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157721_0157907 No, it's 12.25.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158190_0158482 Yeah, well, 2, 12.25 times 2 is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158669_0158815 25
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0160463_0160841 The agenda one was where the price was, wasn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162262_0162338 Drop right side.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162645_0162720 Jumpy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163089_0163418 So has that got us covered for the electronics thing?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163418_0163680 Dydyn ni ddim angen rhywbeth eraill i'w gwneud yn y lle.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0165733_0165921 Alright, so we've done that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166372_0166561 project evaluation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166692_0166948 We've done Room for Creativity, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166948_0167513 because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't, didn't feel able to make.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0167748_0167997 I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168536_0168736 in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168915_0169188 Did you feel like a team?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0169188_0169806 Or did you feel like... I would say it's two. I think it's two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173184_0173296 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173296_0173446 How did you find it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0176832_0177869 Rwy'n hoffi'r ffaith y gallwn ddweud un sy'n sylfaen a byddai'n cyhoeddi bod yna ddewis sy'n iawn, ond nid yw unrhyw un yn teimlo fel ysgafn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0177869_0178399 oedd yn bwysig i chi ddweud yr hyn rydych chi'n meddwl oherwydd os nad oedd hynny'n rhywbeth sy'n ymwneud â hynny.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178399_0178669 It didn't matter because it was just another idea.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178669_0178828 起きるなって
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179060_0179486 Well, you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179596_0180250 I think that was the best part of the book. I'm still not caught up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0180250_0180551 That's nothing to do with teamwork at all.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181444_0181597 Yeah, that was quite fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181597_0182055 Means, whiteboard, digital plans, etc. What does that mean?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0182055_0182133 I think I need to just...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0183562_0183667 had time to kind of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184151_0184614 Yeah, because we could just sort of say, sorry, what did you say about that? Or what do you think about that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184614_0184842 rather than having to email it in.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184842_0184984 but it was nice having it there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0185103_0185350 Like the whole picture of the same.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0189996_0190296 Yeah, I think it's the years in January.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191575_0191709 Yes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191709_0191888 Well, they have to come from somewhere.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192020_0192299 I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192299_0193197 As was shown by your presentation with all of the other remote controls, no one has thought about it particularly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193197_0193678 I mean they're slightly different, so someone's been shut in a room and said my car is a bit different from everyone else's.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193678_0194216 because this is something we should think about but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196176_0196984 But then when everything is really smart and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196984_0197713 I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0197713_0198494 gallant ddod i mewn gyda syniad a'i dylunio ar Photoshop a'i ddysgu ar y plastig.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0198494_0199206 You'd pay a lot extra because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199206_0199556 but people could have anything that they wanted.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199712_0199792 President.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0203973_0204308 Well, it's innovation for money's sake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204308_0204544 that people have to keep up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204806_0205290 And you can get, you've got your handset that works fine, but you can't get battery anymore for that type of phone.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205290_0205582 because the phones have moved on and things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205778_0205904 That's madness.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206223_0206361 In closing...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206460_0206619 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206619_0207514 and
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0207514_0207752 I think that takes into account
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208156_0208471 like us being well paid kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208471_0208983 and the heating for the building to think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209312_0209994 So it looks like it's going to be 50% profit. You've still got all of the overheads to come out of that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209994_0210623 Maybe increasing it you would also have to increase the price they sold it maybe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0210623_0210881 I think but you were saying that that's quite like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213317_0213646 It's a shame it won't ever get made.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213646_0213744 Maybe the other.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213744_0213984 Thank you so much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214271_0214736 The project has been evaluated well and truly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214736_0215214 And we've got the meeting summary question.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215214_0215890 Right, so we've got about 50 minutes to catch up to everything that I've found behind me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215890_0216450 So I'll be delegating my role as project supervisor. So good luck.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0216954_0217203 I think the celebration is the 25th of May.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0217288_0217464 Whoever will be dancing on the dance floor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0218479_0218677 And the edge is the last.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219181_0219500 I think I've got minutes for two of the meetings.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219619_0219703 This thingy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0222167_0222225 We just got
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0001511_0001599 Thousands.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0026214_0026708 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0041713_0041806 Okay.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0042934_0043055 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0045600_0046975 Mae'r amser o'r cyfrifoldeb yn wir i ni fel tîm gael ei gyfrifoldeb os ydyn ni wedi cael ysbrydoli prodwythau a dylunio prototai a fydd yn cydnabod y cyfrifoldeb a gafodd gael o'n ymchwil ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0046975_0047249 Dyma'r cyfan gyntaf ar y cyfrifiad.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047249_0047547 Yn ystod y cyfres o faterion, fel y gwelwn yn ein cyfarfodau cynhaethol,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047547_0048158 ymwneud â'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifoldeb a'r cyfrifroldeb a'r cyfrifroldeb a' a'r

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048836_0049116 Now the findings that we came up with just to recap are here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049116_0049991 y cyfeiriadau y byddwn yn ei eisiau yn y cynllun ymhellach yw gweld a phobl yn gallu gweld, innovasiyn technolegol, bydd yn eithaf hwb i'w defnyddio,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049991_0050845 Mae'n rhaid ei gyfrifolwg â ffasiwnau ffasiwn ar hyn o bryd, ac mae'r ddau pwysicau arall yn y texture spongy ac mae'r coed a'r ffaswnau ddifrifol yn ddifrifolwg ddifrifol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0050845_0051764 Bydd y ffenestr yn rhaid i'r rhain gysylltu â'r RSI ac yn eithaf cyflym i'w leihau. Roeddwn i'n ymddangos yn ychydig o'r ffordd y byddwn i'n defnyddio cyfleuoedd yno.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0051764_0052317 oherwydd roedd hynny'n deimlo'n strategau ffavoreig, ond roedd hefyd ar y rhaglen o feddwl am gallu cael ffynonell bach.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052504_0052880 Iawn, felly gallwn ni ddod yn ôl i'r sgrifennu honno os nad oes gennych adroddiad o'r rhain.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052880_0053466 Fe wnawn ni ddangos sut y byddwn ni'n mynd i arwain ein cymorth ar hyn i'r hyn rydyn ni wedi'i gael ar hyn o bryd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053466_0053913 We're going to use a 7 point scale where 1 is true and 7 is false.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053913_0054337 Fe wnawn ni edrych ar un o'r cyfeiriadau hynny a dwi wedi'u gysylltu yn ôl.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054337_0054894 a byddwn yn gwneud ystod y cyfrifoldeb ar gyfer yr holl ystodau ar y llwybrau gwyn yma.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054894_0054982 Mae hynny'n teimlo'n iawn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054982_0055080 Any questions?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055241_0055377 Felly, byddwn yn edrych ar y rhain.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055519_0056226 Ie. Rydyn ni'n mynd i ddod at... byddwn yn ymwneud â phob un ac byddwn yn dod at ein cyflawniadau'n ymwneud â'r un a'r sefydliad.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056226_0056304 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056304_0056520 Un yw'r ddau, un yw'r fforddau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056932_0057098 So we'll run each one of them out again.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057098_0057436 I'll just give criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057436_0057767 Acdef ychydig.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057767_0058075 And the same D on the left.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0058075_0058416 This is where everyone's going to tell you off, too.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0059577_0060022 Actually, it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating, we could take an average at the end.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0060022_0060152 Yeah, I see.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0060278_0060896 Felly, byddwn i'n separatu'r rhifau gan y bleidiau, ac os ydyn ni'n mynd i un, ddau, tri, ffwrdd, gwybod pa sydd yma.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0061753_0062147 Criterion A. Y ffyndd ymdrechion.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0062147_0062660 sut ydych chi'n teimlo am y model prototype hon ynghylch fanatiaeth?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0062660_0062886 One is true, seven is false.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0062886_0063141 Felly, fy enw i'n gweithio yw hynny.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0063252_0063448 Mae'n dweud y gwir.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0063880_0063962 Yeah, I'll have to.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0065410_0065609 4.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0065609_0066132 Adding those up, we've got 6 and 5, 11 divided by 4 is what?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0066132_0066551 24, 23.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0066551_0066618 24 hours.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0067192_0067463 2.75, there we go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0067463_0067945 yn ymwneud â'r cyfrifoldeb, gan fod cyfrifoldeb yn ymwneud â'r cyfrifoldeb, yn technolegol a'r hollol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0068080_0068370 Rydw i'n rhoi'r A yna i'r ddau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0068895_0069292 Nid ydych chi'n ddifrifo? Na, na, ddim yn hollol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0070532_0070718 Yeah, I just thought it would be a good idea to do that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0070718_0070863 now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071037_0071182 Is that what you're saying?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071496_0071665 So I'm going to cut you out, and I should not get in.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071665_0071800 It's a very slight water.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071959_0072177 Okay, I'm just holding for the rest of the...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0072303_0072420 to your final cake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0072755_0073010 Ladies, you can show yourself.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0073099_0073313 So are you ready for this one?

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0073581_0073734 So that is eight.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0073734_0073991 Mae'r cymaint sy'n mynd i newid yn eithaf cyflym.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074155_0074366 Iawn. Gwneud eich cymaint.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074366_0074483 Easy to use.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074599_0074946 o'r hyn rydych chi wedi'i ddweud yno, rydw i'n dweud un,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0076023_0076113 I'm just kidding.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0076642_0077076 Dylen ni ddweud y ddau i wneud yn wahanol i'r ddau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0077076_0077483 We just put almost two because it's a silly design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0077566_0077898 Rydyn ni'n gobeithio y byddwn ni'n eisiau gwneud hynny'n wirioneddol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0077898_0078492 and when we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0078492_0079300 ac mae hynny'n benodol o ran ein cyfansoddiadau ymchwil ymgyrchu ein bod yn ymwneud â'r texture spongy i'r ystafell a'r cyfnod dylunio frwydr a phwyd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0079543_0080152 felly rwy'n meddwl, cyn i mi roi ato ar y redeg, roeddech chi'n anodd gyda'r materion gysylltiadol ar gyfer eich prototyp yma.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0080152_0080387 Yn y blynyddoedd, a yw'r cymaint yn mynd i fod yn y coloedd?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0081861_0082312 ddweud
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0082405_0082585 Yn y blynyddoedd, mae'r broblem i'w gael.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0083501_0083683 In that case, it's got to be a one for me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0084388_0084676 That part was nice, Eddie.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0084803_0085294 Iawn. Yn ystod y dylunio, a yw'r dylunio'n gwneud ychydig o ddysgu ar gyfer ymdrechion gweithredu?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0085499_0085694 Alev'in yüzüyle hiç açlanamıyor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0085694_0086008 Rydyn ni wedi'i ddisgwyl, ond nid oes gennym ni gynnwys unrhyw beth yno.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086156_0086309 We felt defeated in just how much we could trust.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086309_0086708 We talked about pointage but very usable in our control if you're someone who's that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086708_0087178 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0089981_0090294 I think you're going to have to be neutral on that one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0090814_0090958 I love you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0091194_0091503 Cool.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0091965_0092202 So that's 4129.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0092561_0092947 Ac yn ddiweddar, yn fawr iawn, mae'n haws i'w leihau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0092947_0093561 Yeah, it was.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0093733_0094033 Voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094033_0094237 And I'm happy with the costume.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094237_0094433 Yeah, yeah, I got it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094546_0094641 That sounds good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094641_0095029 We can adjust the volume in that just as we can point to the...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0095216_0095536 Someone's in the other room, or TV's in different rooms.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0096324_0096449 And if you didn't...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0097072_0097157 That's the one for me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0097280_0097564 One. One. And one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0098073_0098582 Felly, sut ydych chi'n teimlo am hyn?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0098582_0099508 Mae gennym ni'r rhif fwyaf o adnoddau cyfarfodol, mae hynny'n wir. Ar gyfer ddau o'r chwech cyfrifiadau yma,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0099508_0100102 Mae hwn yn cymryd ffasodau ffasiynol ar hyn o bryd ac yn eithaf hwyl i'w leihau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0100102_0101119 Mae'r rhagor ychydig sydd gennym, sydd yn eithaf, nid yw'n eithaf lawr, mae'n ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ychydig yn ych
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0101119_0101757 A ydych chi'n teimlo, o ran y ddataoedd ymchwil hwn, y gallwn ni fynd ymlaen a chreu hyn fel brototyp a chynhyrchu?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0101757_0101958 or do you have to make a new location?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0102343_0102440 Yeah, I like it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0102690_0103123 dwi'n credu y byddwch chi hefyd yn ymdrechio i fod yn dda iawn, ond mae'r ddechrau ar y sgiliau ar y ddechrau yn rhaid i chi ddweud hynny.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0103123_0103201 I really don't.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0103308_0103946 on the basis of current technology and current capabilities, we can actually do much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104035_0104199 And...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104279_0104500 I hope that's clear to the team.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104500_0104817 Is there anything you would like to ask me about the findings before?

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0119693_0119769 So what's the

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0120168_0120283 I think it's...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0121063_0121404 Mae'r ardal ar y siwrau eraill yn y saes, ond mae'n ddifrifol ar y ddewis, felly dydyn ni ddim yn ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0124069_0124247 What does it mean if you put .5 here?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0125948_0126093 Das ist immer wichtig.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0126728_0127172 Ond mae'n rhaid i ni fod yn rhan o'r cwrs cyflawni a dyna lle y gallwn ei roi.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0127172_0127484 There's nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0127484_0127676 So do we not have to encode for it in the course somewhere though?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0129433_0129934 Might do, figure out some of the more exotic colours and such like.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0137735_0138224 Os gwnaethoch chi ddysgu'r rhaglen nawr, a oes gennych chi gwneud unrhyw wahanol?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138224_0138383 I'm not going up on her.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138626_0139126 Mae'n ddifrifol i gyd, ond gwneud y casglau rhagor yn ddifrifol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0139563_0139785 Mae'n ddiddorol iawn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0140346_0140507 Let's go ahead and slide it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0141636_0141773 We haven't been getting...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142747_0142880 If we control.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142988_0143645 Os ydyn ni'n mynd allan o'n sylfaen o ddeunydd cyffredinol o ddeunydd cyffredinol, a'r deunyddau'n standard, a allai hynny wneud gwahaniaeth?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0145029_0145509 Yn ystod y blynyddoedd, mae'r cyhoeddiadau yn cael eu cymryd yn ystod y blynyddoedd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0146166_0146338 Do we see what difference it makes?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151180_0151459 But we're still working to...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151568_0151710 In our recreation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151710_0152186 Os ydym yn gweithio i ddewis y pethau arall, dyma beth y mae'r tîm prosiect yn ei weithio ar.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152186_0152756 gallwn gynllunio ein cyfrofaethau ar gyfer yr hyn rydym wedi'i ddod o'r ffordd a'r cyllideb a ddod o'r ffordd ar gyfer y cyfarfodydd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152756_0153037 Ond mae angen i ni weithio i'r sefyllfa hon i ddechrau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153037_0153309 Ac rwy'n credu bod y cyflawniad o flwyddiant yn sain yn dda.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153309_0153981 Ond mae ein cyflwyniad mor ddiddorol, a byddai hyn yn gwneud ei leihau i'w leihau i'w leihau yn y cyfnod cyntaf.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153981_0154491 Fel y dweudwch, gallwn gynhyrchu'r cyflwyniad o'r flwyddyn i gyfleoedd y clasau busnes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0155506_0155799 Because we've done all the background work.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0169656_0170315 Rydyn ni'n gweld eich cymuned yn dda iawn. Roedd yna mor ffwrdd o gysylltiad, mwy o bethau i'w ddod allan.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0182059_0182550 I think it's the first which one's...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0182690_0182872 Could it have been better? Was it adequate?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0190085_0190483 Mae'n dweud y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0190483_0190922 Nid oes unrhyw beth yn newydd, ond mae'n ei ddefnyddio i mewn ardal gwahanol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0191831_0191944 Absolutely, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0196007_0196202 Yeah, but racists don't.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201108_0201817 Rwy'n credu bod hyn wedi bod yn ddiddorol o ran ymchwil.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201817_0202407 Dyma'r cymdeithas cyntaf ar gyfer debygau cyntaf sy'n gwneud yn eithaf amlwg.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202407_0202851 Rydyn ni'n gweld e mewn ffônau cefnogol yn fawr ac dyna lle rydyn ni wedi gyrraedd ychydig o syniadau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202851_0203137 There are innovations in that that people don't really want.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203137_0203687 Rwy'n gweld pobl yn eisiau model o'r ffôn rydyn nhw'n hapus iawn, ond nid ydynt yn gallu ei gael arall. Mae'n gyfrifol am gyfrifol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203687_0203961 Ac rwy'n credu bod yn dda iawn bod ein cymdeithasau ni'n sefydlog ar gyfer R&D.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204421_0204579 Keep forcing it onto people.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205906_0205983 and
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0208960_0209296 I think it was just the production.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0210855_0211119 Dwi'n credu bod y cyfrifiadau a oeddwn i'n ei roi yn unigol iawn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211119_0211269 I think we've done what we're required to do.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211269_0211781 ac rwy'n credu y byddai'n rhaid i gyd fod ar gyfer ein rhaglen newydd i ni edrych ar y math o bethau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211781_0212244 Dydyn ni ddim yn meddwl bod hynny'n rhywbeth rydyn ni'n rhaid ei wneud i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i ddod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd i dod o hyd
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0212398_0213152 Mae'n dweud y byddai'n ddiddorol iawn i gael y budget i mewn ac mae'n dal i wneud eitem hyfryd sy'n hyfryd i bobl.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213477_0213648 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213648_0213692 Maybe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213692_0214036 I have 50 more ideas than Phillip.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0219792_0219958 Student.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0220084_0220492 Wel, nid oedd yn rhaid i mi ddweud i chi sut rydych chi wedi'i gynhyrchu'r cyfarfod hon.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221077_0221151 Oh right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221151_0221379 Ond ydych chi'n gwybod, mewn amser, y byddwn yn ymwneud â'r cyfansoddau hyn?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009137_0009262 for us.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009949_0010093 Iawn, gallaf ddangos?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010093_0010200 One sec.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010200_0010830 Do you want to hold it? I'll take your presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010830_0010982 Yes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0011655_0011774 It's gonna be crazy, isn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0012076_0012140 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0013863_0014453 Iawn, felly dyma ein cynnig a'n ffyrdd yn ein cyfrifoldeb.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0014453_0015093 And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015277_0015894 Mae'n mynd i fod yn rhan o'r cyllid plasig, gyda'r colwg arbennig.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015894_0016555 y byddwn ni'n meddwl rhywbeth yn eithaf yn ystodol fel un o'r blaenau gwych neu'n hwyl.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0016555_0017582 Mae hwn yn ymlaen at y casglu o'r rheswm rheswm, a byddai'n penderfyniad fawr y byddai'n cael eu cymryd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017582_0017838 But we can come up with it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017838_0018731 Mae'r pethau gwahanol o ffurfiau a ffurfiau, felly mae gennych llawer o gwneud ymddan â'r cyfnod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0018731_0020259 Mae'n dylunio'n ddwyieithiol, ac mae'r ddwyieithiol LCD yn y grin, a gallwch ei weld yna, yn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020371_0020670 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020670_0021549 byddai'n ymgyrchu i'r gofyn, ac mae'r bwys yn y bot yn llwyr, felly byddai'n llwyr i gael ei gosod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021549_0021771 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021771_0022666 Rydyn ni'n gweithio ar y ffurf, ac rydyn ni wedi dechrau ar y batriau cenedlaethol, sy'n
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0022666_0023422 thinking about it now you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get it in the top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0023993_0024362 Rydyn ni wedi ddechrau bod y system cyfathrebu sŵn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024362_0024997 ac roeddent yn dweud ar y cofnodau y byddent yn dod i mewn ac roeddent yn eithaf hawdd i'w gael.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024997_0025272 So we presume that that also be quite cheap.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025272_0025780 So you have something like where you chat at, where is the remote?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025911_0026127 It'll shout back, I'm here or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026345_0026723 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026723_0026955 It won't shout out I'm here or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026955_0027532 It was just a shout out, I'm here. Or something similar.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0027532_0028157 Yeah, if it was getting there, well that could be something for next time, maybe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028157_0028476 you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028476_0029174 Bydd y trasmisiwn arbennig gyda'r TV gan ddefnyddio'r pwysigau arbennig rydyn ni wedi siarad am.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029174_0029767 Byddai'n dweud, yn amlwg, oherwydd ei fod wedi'i rhannu ar ddau ffyrdd gwahanol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029767_0030462 byddai'r PCBau'n rhaid i'r ddau gael eu cysylltu ar y hynge drwy rhai gweithio.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0030462_0031657 and because obviously all TVs use this same infrared medium we'd just be using the same thing to transmit the data.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031657_0031836 and the infrared.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031988_0032552 um y sender bydd yn y ar un o'r ysgolion y llawer
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0032552_0032972 Mae'r ddegau ar y ffront o'r...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033080_0033210 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033420_0033651 Yeah, near the front side.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033990_0034391 So when you've actually got eggs in it, it would be facing the TV.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034391_0034801 Ac yna'r haf yma.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034801_0035814 The top screen, as we said, would be an inset black and white LCD touch screen, which would
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0035930_0037058 Mae'r ffocws arall yn ymwneud â phopeth ar gael ar y remote, yn hytrach na bod y sgrin ymlaen yn cynnwys dim ond y botwmau'n standard.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0037058_0038061 like the volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off and things to that effect.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0038061_0039089 Ac nawr, rydyn ni hefyd wedi penderfynu ar y gwirionedd gallwn efallai bod yna rhai ffyrdd o
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0039240_0039783 Logo on it or something insert or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top. I
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040004_0040229 Na, nid yn unig.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040229_0040867 No, not interfering with the whole look of the product when it's... hell on the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040867_0041709 And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics. Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0042881_0043105 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0060100_0060169 Yeah, I see.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0063870_0064567 Yeah, I'd probably put it two, yeah, two or three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0064567_0064642 Night 3.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066278_0066375 Yn y bryd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066839_0066952 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0068639_0068737 I do it alone.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0069005_0069175 네, 너무 좋아요.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080119_0080264 Iawn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080340_0081046 nid yw'r mewncarna oedd yn bwyd yn fwy
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0081046_0082045 Ond bydd y newid yn eich cymryd i'ch gael unrhyw un o'r nifer o ffyrdd o ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082154_0082482 iawn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082589_0083208 No, no, that's the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put around it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083208_0083491 that otherwise is just sort of plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083801_0083950 Get out and do the fun stuff.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0087592_0087662 You may be my assistant.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0090559_0090965 Yeah, I'm good for a five actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0093454_0093931 Yeah, it was voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0094276_0094535 Yeah, yeah, that's true.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095126_0095345 I think...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095602_0096244 I think it would probably be a standard. It would be quite large. It would be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0096244_0096449 And if you didn't...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097153_0097308 Yeah, I'm done.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097680_0098250 I do realise that we might be failing by this point.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0102290_0102604 dwi'n credu, ie, dwi'n hoffi, dwi'n credu, ie, dwi'n credu
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0114834_0115187 with regular Chetian branch mounds.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0115809_0115964 I'll learn in a day, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116133_0116678 Ie, rydych chi wedi rhoi trwy ar y nifer o ffyrdd gynedig, dyma ddau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116802_0117113 In the top, it's the number. Oh, right. Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0117466_0117955 So it would be two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118064_0118366 Yeah, one of them and then one sample sent to the sample screen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118818_0118949 Ну и да, вот что у нас.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119293_0119443 Because it's just about you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119850_0120257 Ie, rydw i'n dweud...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120464_0120574 One double curl.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120693_0121171 Yn ystod y cyrff, mae'r arfer yn ddwyran.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0121776_0121846 Bye guys
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0122318_0122413 It's your best link for the next video.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0125714_0125931 No, no, that's... It's including.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0126045_0126679 Felly dyna ddim yn ddweud y gwir, nid yw'n cymryd yn y cwestiynau'r ystafell.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0128633_0128764 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0130421_0130825 Yeah, the push buttons one and LC display one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0131134_0131227 But.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0138203_0138312 نعم
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139752_0139857 I'm up again.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139938_0140207 I know you've got to click off to conclude.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0140518_0141065 You might be assuming that that is in Euros.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141065_0141279 It could be in dollars.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141279_0141927 We haven't been dealing with dollars though
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0143648_0144016 Yes, stand it. We will make one difference.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144016_0144324 The biggest one would be taking away, if you took away...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144543_0144579 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145099_0145444 Os ydych chi'n cymryd y llwybrau, dwi ddim yn hoffi eu dweud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145444_0145718 If you take voice recognition, then you've got it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146347_0146418 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146418_0146869 Where's the voice recognition? It's samples sent to sample speakers.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146869_0147206 Right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0147540_0148015 minus 3
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150154_0150760 Ond dwi ddim yn deall pam rydyn ni wedi rannu 25 o eiroed yn ôl.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150760_0151132 because they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0152684_0152856 We need to work to that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0153005_0153128 Yeah, I think so.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154713_0154772 Yeah, nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154997_0155203 We had our prayers.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0156794_0157060 So I'll do it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157060_0157389 좋아하고, 잘 돼.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157389_0157688 Is it 12.50?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0163776_0164224 Oherwydd roedd hwn yn bolt ar y cyfnod, gallwch chi ddweud hynny.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0164377_0164535 I'm gonna do it with you for a minute.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0165505_0165598 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0169504_0169624 I'm gonna say it's T-
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0170117_0170307 find out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173464_0173955 iawn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173955_0174893 Rwy'n teimlo bod pawb wedi'u gwrando i mewn ac mae'r pwyntau a oedd eu cyhoeddi yn cael eu gysylltu.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0174893_0175366 Though we didn't quite make the voice recognition there, but that's good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0175366_0176275 Rwy'n credu byddai wedi'i wneud i'r cynllun diweddar, os oeddwn ni'n gweld y cyfansoddiad yn ymlaen cyn i'r cyfansoddiad cyntaf.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0176275_0176799 Ac rwy'n credu efallai byddai'n ddiffer eich hun yn ddifrif.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0179518_0179601 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182025_0182333 I think it's the first which one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182963_0183503 I think we probably would have used the actual email system more had we actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0183706_0184183 o amser mwy ac os oeddwn wedi cael ei ffwrdd o'i gysylltiad mwy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0193972_0194451 No one's put any great deal of thought into it. I don't think the companies are really concerned.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194451_0194929 They're just like, we've got a DVD player, does anyone remember the remote control?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194929_0195222 Can't you get the one that we used for the last one?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195222_0195447 Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195447_0195953 They don't really think about it because normally the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195953_0196277 They're trying to shift the DVD player from video to DVD.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0209117_0209327 I think that was just the physical.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0210588_0211064 ond rydych chi'n dweud bod hynny'n ddiddorol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0212327_0212444 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213821_0213994 I'm sad.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213994_0214279 It's a conspiracy going on here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0214279_0214376 I'm so sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0216025_0216367 in my role as project supervisor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0218350_0218423 Misafir.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221156_0221346 Ond nid ydych chi'n ymwneud â'i gynhyrchu ar y cyfnodau hyn?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221346_0221542 Yeah, this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221542_0221919 I think, yeah, question seven was the one I did just before.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002299_0002344 Thank you.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0012565_0012623 I'm just kidding.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0013210_0013453 I'm aware of the hinges.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0015304_0015388 It's gonna have a...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0020479_0020798 Yeah, yeah, it would be so in
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0027429_0027532 I know, good chicken.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033228_0033450 Yeah

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055079_0055182 No, I'm just kidding.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055336_0055621 Is it everybody's going to evaluate or just the ones?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0060095_0060228 Yeah, I see.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0065308_0065495 É um teflon.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070123_0070298 The first one reading, I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070298_0070429 Can you just make it two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070543_0070603 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070603_0070757 Yeah, I just put it in.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070898_0070995 Eh, eh, eh.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0071117_0071242 Yep, I agree.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072069_0072130 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072878_0073085 Eğiz'i görebileceğimiz için çok şükür.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080695_0080800 Wine or...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080800_0080861 Oh my...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0082600_0082771 No, no, that's...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0083007_0083114 in the Bronx.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0093601_0093754 Voice
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0107878_0108004 We need to unplug that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0109655_0109698 It's a
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0115001_0115080 to get one of these.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119093_0119208 See one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119371_0119432 Just be lovely.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120299_0120367 So just one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120773_0120865 because one of them
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122178_0122445 That's tickle one and maybe a bit of a point for them.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122756_0123099 I think rubber since it's being used just as a casing we can put 0.5
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123349_0123443 Yeah, because it'll...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123549_0123800 I think it allows a...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123800_0123894 We can use that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124252_0124459 We are not using a lot of rubber actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124459_0124535 It would be like...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124679_0124956 a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0130211_0130272 push button.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137174_0137358 You could change the battery also
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137358_0137594 instead of going for kinetic, how about going for a standard factor?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139161_0139263 Good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139789_0139960 It's gone up again, but it's not calculated.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141567_0141760 We haven't been getting...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141989_0142114 I think it's in your room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0143373_0143511 We're doing the cover.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144422_0144689 But I feel these customers never said anything about the factory
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144689_0144939 It's internal, nobody looks into the battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144939_0145209 But shape and curve.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0145866_0146022 with that special flow.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0146133_0146305 Dylwn ni weld pa gwahaniaeth yw'r neith.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0151558_0151753 In our reclamation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157223_0157350 Nie, nie pracować.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157501_0157589 to
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0158800_0158933 It's true.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160150_0160473 I don't know what it is. It said 50% is the cost.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160473_0160647 A couple of the times.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0161295_0161388 I think that is a plus for me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0162472_0162610 Sarı yağındadır.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165317_0165375 Seems fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165580_0165807 except for the admission everything else.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0169703_0169821 I think it's really nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171331_0171714 I think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171714_0172027 It's not like people trying to cut each other.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172027_0172218 It is more of a cohesive game work.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172218_0172557 So we came to a very creative design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172672_0172761 And...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172892_0172964 Yeah, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172964_0173137 اگر آپ کو جلد ویڈیو کو سارا مناسبتی ہے
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0179596_0179920 I think that was the best part of the book.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185416_0185717 Yeah, I'm pretty much moving around the room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185717_0186263 I think it's good, like we spend time individually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0189474_0189743 I never thought of remote control with a flip top.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191020_0191204 That's mine.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191664_0191739 Yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192004_0192079 The planet has changed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192175_0192251 it's
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0199681_0200613 Surprising to me is that people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones. Like every month you see a new launch or something like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0200613_0201118 and new television products coming up but nobody giving much idea to this
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0201118_0201302 I think it's really good that this has been...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0210559_0210707 Maybe if you lost a thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0213665_0213719 Maybe the artist.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0215140_0215234 I
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0216751_0216948 Celebration
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005586_0005769 Okay, everybody ready?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005769_0006085 I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006200_0006547 and his name and what your function is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006547_0006729 Jadi mungkin kita akan mulakan dengan
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0008798_0008859 And your name is?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010788_0010851 Very good.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010851_0011071 And as you already know, I'm Betsy.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011071_0011307 I'm the project manager for today.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011307_0011817 So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012134_0012611 There's the opening, acquaintance, tool training, love.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012611_0013238 The tools, I think we already, I guess the tool is really the computer, as far as I can see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013287_0013804 Each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013804_0014097 project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014097_0014616 I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014944_0015168 Here is what this thing should be.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015168_0015754 This thing here I'm going to design. I use a new remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015754_0016232 Should be original trendy and of course user friendly
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0016519_0016699 So maybe you'll make some notes of that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019638_0019744 All right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019744_0020164 Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0020378_0021157 That is, it's going to be in real work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021157_0021820 The same goes for the conceptual design. There will be individual work and then discussion afterwards.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021944_0022212 detail design. Same thing basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0024394_0024545 Dwi ddim yn gallu defnyddio'r sôn.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025468_0025736 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025736_0025774 All right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026002_0026470 Then tool training, try out the white board, pursue and control your favorite animal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026470_0026872 Does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026872_0027252 so that in case we have to, during the next meeting, present something on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027468_0027612 You want to go, Eileen?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027758_0027986 whether you're... without hanging yourself.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0028810_0029082 And remember, you have to press so it works.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0030752_0031064 That's a fact.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032052_0032258 And you're front seat, right?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032258_0032750 Would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033022_0033083 I don't know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033083_0033153 No, that's okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033357_0033549 I didn't get to that night.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0036725_0037272 Here's the project finance, which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037272_0037593 Selling price is supposed to be 25 euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037725_0038609 The profit aim for the company is 50 million euro. The market range is unlimited, meaning international.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0038740_0039364 and production costs should not exceed, hopefully should be less than 1250 euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0040381_0041267 So these are all things of course to remember with the budget and when you design to materials, cost, etc.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0041916_0042758 Now, the discussion I guess is, does any one of you have experience with remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0042895_0043324 We use them, right, every day.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043324_0043499 And...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043656_0044399 Now, having used the remote control for years, does anybody already have an idea, like things you didn't like with it?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0044399_0044923 things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with the thing, any first ideas?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0045037_0046058 Do you like it to be smaller, bigger, have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons, you know, things like that?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0046515_0046621 small right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0048672_0049526 So it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051311_0051812 It should be something new. It should do something different than just what we have.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051812_0052107 Now, of course, the other thing to think there is maybe the design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052422_0052829 Like trendy, you know, like earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052829_0053345 Maybe I can... I can choose. I can choose.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0053345_0053873 So yeah, shapes, right? You know, like kidney-shaped feels better in your hand or something, you know?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055123_0055827 That is true. They put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or you know, whatever.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055827_0056564 And suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the TV off and say, why the hell is my remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0056614_0057317 Or if it's really in a dark spot, that it gives out a sound or a signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057471_0057593 Beef lost.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057674_0058145 If lost, throw a signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058567_0058790 Exactly, I mean just that's why I'm saying
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058790_0059260 I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a light
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060567_0060957 Okay, my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060957_0061646 In other words, if it's in a dark spot, meaning the newspaper is on top.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0061646_0062032 sweater is on top or it's behind a plant.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062032_0062575 at that moment it's like, it's like, what do you call it, the light sensors, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062575_0063003 In that moment it has a center, it gets a certain darkness.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063003_0063476 It has a sensor and it gives out a signal, whether that be a light signal or a beep.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063476_0063721 I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064129_0064224 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064224_0065078 you know, it would be... right, you have to have some kind of sensor. And I think voice or clapping, that's not specific enough.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0065078_0065848 I know there are the lamps and stuff, you know, you can clap on and off, but I think they only work to a certain degree.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066408_0066480 what we're
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066770_0067159 Oh yeah, well, but then those people, we can't help everybody.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0067808_0068395 Okay, we have to move along. But I think we have some good points to start with here.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068584_0068849 Okay, the next meeting will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068849_0069212 I think you all – did you get notices on your computer for this?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069212_0069545 Okay, so you've got the notice.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069545_0070163 the working design, I guess that's the function ID, which is this.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070163_0070398 Industrial designer. That's you.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070746_0071113 So we're looking for a working design when we come back.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0071572_0072011 and then the technical function, so you're the working design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072011_0072439 So you have a working design and then a functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072439_0073430 And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness and what we just discussed in general.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073430_0073594 That would be your idea.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073594_0073824 and of course price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073824_0074169 I did, I did, but the price is a good price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074169_0074465 I mean, the price is given, but that was...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074633_0074679 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074944_0075008 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075138_0075610 and you will get specific instructions for that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075610_0075784 I think that's the end of the show.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0076472_0077087 So we have time, two, three minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077087_0077357 Any questions at this point?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077357_0077595 or suggestions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077780_0078716 I think basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions, I guess you can...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0079796_0080194 Then we see you in about 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0080194_0080361 and see what we can come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009185_0009269 and January
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009269_0010740 I am, my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0042869_0043119 We use
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0048170_0048273 temperature inside
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0049278_0049524 machines basically
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0051779_0051874 Now, of course,
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0052783_0053265 Maybe I can... different colors or materials.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0053809_0053924 I'm taking it home.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0057201_0057472 or a signal or something like that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058148_0058588 Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can just recognize where it is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058588_0058634 Exactly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058700_0058795 That's why I say
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0059086_0059303 people with light.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0063430_0063763 a beep, I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066398_0066528 What?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066611_0066715 Because you're silly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0068207_0068311 Good points.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0069165_0069233 for this.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0070461_0070773 Yeah, it's functioning. Yeah, okay, so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071171_0071568 네
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071725_0071875 clinical functions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079125_0079260 I love you people.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079260_0079395 Yes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079652_0079781 All right, well, let's see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006739_0006909 My name is Franz.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006909_0007661 and I'm a user interface. My role is, the main responsibility is user interface.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0007661_0008083 And my role is to design a television remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032223_0032416 But just to see
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032416_0032508 Yeah, I'm sure.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033158_0033336 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033747_0033963 I shouldn't.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0034799_0034978 I'm going to go to sleep.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0035586_0035895 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0045394_0045442 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046146_0046571 Yes, I feel that all the remote should be very compact. Small.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046571_0046979 Those which we get here nowadays, it's very long.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046979_0047276 And it should have multipurpose.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047276_0047914 like the remote control which we use for TV, it should be used for some other purpose also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047914_0048673 like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating systems.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0048848_0048946 Yes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052105_0052326 Yeah, design should be, yeah, it should be different.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052326_0052544 almost all the...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052790_0052882 Yes, maybe I can.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0053067_0053246 materials also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057312_0057325 you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057704_0057778 영상편집 및 자막을 사용하였습니다.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057858_0058016 signal with me.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0063866_0063918 And...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0066540_0066638 because
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0005725_0005770 I think so.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0006154_0006257 Yeah, that's a good one.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008339_0008533 And I'm a marketing person.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008533_0008694 I want to figure out how to set them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008882_0008969 My name is Ivy.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022046_0022155 I'm sensing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022276_0022645 different types of design that we're going to be concerned with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0023611_0023838 Exception. Exception.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024101_0024250 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024812_0025104 Maybe we should redesign?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0025279_0025469 After we finish the remote control, we'll get to that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027623_0027852 Okay, I'll see what I can do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027852_0027889 We know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0028008_0028551 See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029006_0029219 That's a good point.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029219_0029775 um, traditional Japanese
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0030798_0031573 That's a fat cat. That's a very fat cat.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0031573_0031812 And it likes to sit like that. Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0032877_0033282 No, no, no, that's okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035732_0035806 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035999_0036482 I hope the kitty cat is hungry because I don't like snacks.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0039523_0039851 That should keep everybody on their toes and challenged.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0040286_0040648 So these are all things of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0049614_0050276 €12.50 per...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050378_0050675 Well, who knows, if we get a really good sign, maybe we can do that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050780_0051357 We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things it should be
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0051736_0051776 this hat.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0053853_0054232 Yeah
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0054232_0055025 I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap, because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0055025_0055113 They can't find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0056602_0056712 Well, or yeah, or
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0057264_0057676 So it should either be blue or the light should blink.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0058039_0058091 signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0059225_0060571 I think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond... What should you have to do to make it beep or blink?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0062554_0062623 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0063909_0064125 So the light sensor would activate the signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0065819_0066177 It could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066522_0066689 Because you're silly
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066689_0066793 because people are so-
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066866_0067777 and those can be, we can't help everybody. Well, if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table, um...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0067777_0067999 You know, maybe we have to move along.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0074525_0074986 We have to justify that by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0078758_0079163 I think I want to think about our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079163_0079283 a lot of cheap people.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079650_0079774 All right, well, let's see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0080380_0080453 Okay, we're good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0003732_0003865 Okay, so everybody ready?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0004717_0005869 I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do. Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0006079_0006733 I think the marketing manager probably should come first, addressing the needs and desires.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0007843_0007903 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0009559_0009705 Participant
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010096_0010373 Okay, okay, face green.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010629_0010753 Uh oh.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034130_0034686 one other appliance or maybe a lamp. Can I at this point interject something?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034686_0035355 We have received instruction from higher-ups that certain things should not be considered.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0035355_0036262 The one thing, for example, something to eliminate maybe, that's the teletext because that's outdated because of the internet.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0036262_0037062 And according to higher management, it should only control the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0037062_0038107 mostly because they feel that it's too complex a task to include other things and they're concerned with the time to market.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0038285_0039112 And the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039112_0039508 and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039508_0040221 so that it's easy, that they can be easily identified as a product of the company.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040221_0040704 and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is printing this out.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040704_0041353 So I just wanted you to check this here so we're not getting too much off track here with the things we want to look at.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041353_0041995 These were instructions from higher up, so we have to eliminate these things. It's only going to be TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041995_0042510 But the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0042638_0042729 Okay. All right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056303_0056460 And our
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056599_0057157 Who would be next? I guess that would be... you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0057229_0057449 You want me to get your stash out?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058082_0058319 You are number three, number two.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058319_0058366 Now it's...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060454_0060526 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060798_0060871 Exactly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0071692_0072250 That's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0083585_0084194 I think it's possible. Yeah, well, that's been eliminated. So that's a question you'd point out.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0085700_0085744 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086748 It just built them all basically, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086928_0087468 It's a budget we're looking at if you build one more that's going to make a big difference whether it's going to be square or...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088357_0088405 Oh, yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088531_0089146 I think we will have to look at the budget on that, but I think in principle that would be kind of fine.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089146_0089183 because we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089549_0089661 Silly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089733_0089875 Congratulations
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096671_0096935 a little elderly, a little arthritic hand, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096935_0097875 and it's a small button and they don't press it exactly you know something else happens not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0100099_0100191 I'll get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102284_0102486 Because the clock could be really friendly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102808_0103154 Yeah, you're saying that maybe you have no other...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0108556_0108634 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0111613_0111738 shoulder.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0115161_0115274 Oh, you don't have to.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0117944_0117979 This one?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0119741_0119918 And one more.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120040_0120160 You are a student.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120306_0120341 you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0121071_0121245 Would you want the tool for the...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0127901_0128111 on the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0128111_0128168 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0130485_0130598 I
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0149375_0149515 Timer here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0150288_0150602 Okay. Now, here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0153384_0154275 on my side. So basically we have already done the agenda and on the closing basically there will be a lunch break and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0154275_0155070 However, the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155070_0155734 and what function working design how does it work.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155734_0156064 So these are the two things we should come up with.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0156064_0156654 So the first thing is maybe a little easier on the who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157093_0157263 I guess in many ways, everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157448_0157621 Semua orang yang ada TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157798_0158314 Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158314_0158496 There are a few but in general not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158673_0159520 Now, talking about the target group, which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0159520_0160519 We have earlier, it was mentioned about, for example, elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160519_0160975 So I think that's one group that's certainly important.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160975_0161845 Then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0161845_0162455 and I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0162455_0163223 I mean that's a question, whether that's important that children can really use it or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163447_0163714 So these are just some thoughts I have on it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163714_0165367 And I don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're going to design this one thing. Or whether we're looking at what we like, we're talking about different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0165367_0166225 whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0167876_0168847 a lot of marketing pull. That has a lot of appeal, but I think, I'm talking about the functionality now on it, whether we're looking at different groups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0168847_0169322 I think the children issue can be addressed with the shade and with colors.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0169322_0170178 You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent banana color or whatever, you know. You make a banana shape one. Yeah, for example, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170178_0170467 But the question is really, who is our target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170623_0170867 Do we look at one target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170984_0172090 And with the 25 euros, you know, can we afford to have, I'm asking the technical people here whether to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0172297_0172966 sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group, how much would that throw us
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0173074_0173490 out of the cost we are supposed to respect.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0175538_0175628 We have a question.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0176298_0176399 Well, that's the best.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0179785_0180380 The question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0180380_0181272 And I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons, you know, within the target groups or subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0181272_0182218 The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182218_0182431 I mean, the basic design I understand will be the same.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182431_0183428 But the question is how much will that set us back if, let's say, 40% we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons, for example?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0183533_0184353 So that remains to be seen, but the charge group as a whole is basically everybody with a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0185553_0185747 Yeah, well that's the question.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0186847_0187426 Well, maybe there's an idea, you know, for example, new portable phones.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187426_0187816 They have like removable plastic cases.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187816_0188477 So you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0188477_0190040 that in each package you have, for example, you have fluorescent blue on it, but then you have another color or stripe, whatever, that already comes in the package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190040_0190371 And then if people really want more colors, they can buy it separately.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190507_0190650 Yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190927_0190982 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190982_0191694 But like if everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe or whatever they have as another one in the package
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0191694_0192696 and they can go to the store for a few francs or euros, whatever, they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it, you know, for example.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0194549_0196111 Well, I think the idea here is to design one remote and the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics, if you want to put it that way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0196111_0197066 having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people, either for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197287_0197556 Five minutes, I guess that's the old message.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197828_0197944 Finish me dessert.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197944_0198241 Um...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0198892_0199452 But I think to sum it up, the target group is basically everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0199452_0200023 If money permits, we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200145_0200247 I agree.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200474_0201028 Do we agree on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201207_0201447 So now I understand it's lunch break.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201548_0201631 And um...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201778_0201922 So that's what we will do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202220_0202324 So thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202439_0202690 And we'll see you after lunch.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0011039_0011117 free.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0026483_0026554 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0037439_0037582 to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057119_0057188 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057335_0057454 Yeah, I'd show up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057454_0057498 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0058247_0058379 Number two.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059092_0059158 Thanks.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059376_0059594 Can you give the full screen, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059841_0060125 No, it's like that. You have to just hit it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060245_0060521 Yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060521_0060592 Turn, turn, turn.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060771_0060994 So today
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060994_0061373 I am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061373_0061644 Can you go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061832_0062592 The method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0062592_0063941 It takes the power from a battery, say a battery. It can't be an electric supply. You have to connect your remote controller to a power supply from the electricity or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0063941_0066293 it should be a battery because remote control should be like you should take it to wherever you want. And then this integrated circuit takes energy from the power source and whatever, like if you press a button, it's like input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into infrared bits and it sends it to the device.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066293_0066601 like a TV or air conditioner something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066643_0067027 A remote controller is specifically designed to a single device.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0067027_0068629 if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0068629_0070147 It should recognize the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action. Like if you press a button, channel or something like that, then the remote controller will send a signal.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070147_0070757 and the TV it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070757_0071600 change the volume control. So I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0071851_0071905 management.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0072628_0073653 So, user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user interface like a switch pad or something like that, buttons should be there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073653_0073867 So you can control whatever you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073867_0076040 you want to change the channel, you want to control the volume, you want to mute the TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations, there should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit, so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and TV can perform the actions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076111_0076315 So we're getting good and relaxed.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076382_0077721 I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller. I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much of the investment also.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0077721_0079412 It's like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller. Those we can make like fluorescent. They'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0079506_0081211 And there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed. If suppose a child is playing with the remote control and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time, then there should be a beep saying that. This is not a, you know, action.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081211_0081515 there can be no action taken to that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081515_0081690 and there should be a child lock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081690_0083182 like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like if you have kids and all then they'll be playing with remote controllers so you can lock the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0083182_0084080 make it usable for more than one device. It's hard, but I think it's possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084080_0084245 Yeah, good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084245_0085364 and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and um so that's good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0085488_0085806 Yeah, and colors also.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086009_0086577 No, no, I don't think it will be like you can have you know, if you want it just build a base
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086627_0086683 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086683_0086926 It's just sheets, it doesn't matter.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088300_0088570 Yeah, that is also possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088713_0088792 Yeah, they're both general.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089120_0089205 Because we had
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089635_0089884 Like a dinosaur.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089884_0090028 That's good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090210_0090371 아, 네.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090440_0091106 And the buttons also, I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller, then there should be more buttons.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091106_0091392 If there are more buttons, then it will be more complicated.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091392_0091748 If you have less features, then your remote controller won't be attractive.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091748_0092561 So I think we need to make some buttons which are intended for two or three operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0092561_0093299 like if you press one button in one mode, then it will change the channel. If you press the other button in another mode, it will change the color.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0093299_0093901 So if you want to have less buttons, we can have that option, but I think it will complicate the matter more.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0094196_0094311 the
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0095879_0096045 It's like you and I
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0096256_0096337 the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0097647_0097780 being girls and they're very
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0098176_0098450 You don't feel the motion.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099002_0099208 Shapes also different
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099208_0099290 a triangle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100079_0100646 But we'll get to that with you. And also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguities. That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100706_0100788 That's a good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100893_0102201 and display clock if you want more features then we can display a clock I don't think it will take any money extra money because we have integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102313_0102440 because the clock could be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102753_0103119 Yeah, you seem to say that you maybe have no other...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0103811_0104056 Can you go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104056_0104880 uh... components of the main components we need for uh... it has like buttons and uh... underneath that there should be switch
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104880_0105030 and bulbs
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105030_0105851 like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on suppose.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105851_0106265 then the remote controller should automatically have a light.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106384_0106796 then it will be like if you switch on your TV through another source
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106796_0107456 not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107456_0107578 Maybe we can have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107578_0107880 Whenever the TV is on, remote controller will have a light.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108020_0108277 and then in fluorine bulbs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108277_0108576 This is later when it is dark.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108668_0109143 and battery, there should be a battery for power supply and a chip.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109143_0109521 which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109521_0110074 and wires connecting all chips which is lights.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110167_0110652 Of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110652_0111183 you know, different shapes or whatever the base, there should be a case to put, to give a shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0111509_0111579 That's a cool look.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112017_0112192 I don't know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112286_0112464 Next slide please.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112611_0113850 I have referred the site, the home page of the website from where I got few points.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0114021_0114147 That's it. That's it for me now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115275_0115370 It's not like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115370_0116172 I have referred the page to get new ideas of what can be the working design to how it works.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116450_0116514 if you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116568_0116646 Спасибо.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0117636_0117926 It's actually there on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137491_0137642 able to show.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137642_0137890 If there is a cloth, then that can be a lot of fun.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0149124_0149678 later and use it. Okay, it's like a timer. Timer. Yeah, and then you can use it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0157482_0157685 還有戒律
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0158170_0158348 don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0175767_0176417 We can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0176666_0176809 and middle-aged.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177578_0177728 Of course that we can do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177728_0179020 but specifically if elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a big remote controller. So maybe specifically you can design a remote controller for elderly and for children.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179020_0179123 about the electronics.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179295_0179446 It doesn't cost.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179728_0179872 It doesn't matter.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186614_0186661 years.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186661_0186947 I don't think so.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186947_0187015 There's an SBA.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0190462_0191133 Yeah, like for mobile phones we have different covers, designs and all.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0194588_0194668 I think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198668_0198931 I can't just point to our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198931_0199144 I think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200029_0200753 Do we agree on that in principle?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200825_0200991 that we will be able to do that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0202280_0202326 much
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0026925_0026998 Somebody take it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0027570_0027685 December sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0071586_0071643 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0085727_0085777 I'm just kidding.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0086714_0086806 Just us.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0089813_0089969 Ein Mädchen durch.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0097699_0097754 and they were
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0102334_0102375 because
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111068_0111184 machine.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111410_0111519 A case holder.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111519_0111649 A hole.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0119903_0119972 to spend
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0120208_0120273 No, not in three.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121036_0121146 What do you want?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121146_0121371 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121442_0122422 As a user interface designer, I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122422_0122697 Can you please go on to my next slide?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122697_0123822 So I found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance, at remote distance.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0123988_0124081 Now for that...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0124081_0125332 A remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the TV and it can control the functionalities, different functionalities of the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0125332_0126793 There should be a signal, something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a LED, which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television. If the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume, he can change it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0126978_0127965 Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user's choice.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128388_0128951 If you want to view a particular program, let's say 9 o'clock, he can set the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128951_0129389 And the TV will automatically switch on at that particular time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0129389_0130658 So, he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0130658_0131316 then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0131316_0132153 And one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0132383_0133347 The remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV, television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0133347_0134209 And this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T, an alphabet for more compactability.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134353_0134816 And there's one more point which I noted it down.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134816_0135989 Like the material which is used for remote should be human friendly. It should not cause any skin disease or something, some allergy to either children or to an adult person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0135989_0137124 and it can have an alarm clock. A person, if somebody wants to get up at around 8 p.m., and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137124_0137523 And I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137830_0138232 Yes, and as Janhvi said, the buttons can be...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0138232_0139184 We can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons. So different buttons will glow differently.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139184_0139773 So even in the dark, the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139914_0140886 and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections. So that if a child plays with the remote,
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0140886_0141138 He should not be harmed in any way
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0141528_0142412 and findings. I found out in different sites that there are different remotes which can be used
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0142412_0143443 There are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities. There are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0143608_0144513 So you have different types of remotes with different light source, which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145325_0145407 in this.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145632_0146151 And these are my few personal preferences, like it can be used for multipurpose use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0146201_0147193 No, like it can be used as a TV control plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing and it should have a child lock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147193_0147988 And then to save electricity, there should not be lots of circuits and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147988_0148961 And if a person, if parents wants the television to be switched off by 10 o'clock, then it should be switched off at 10 o'clock automatically.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0148961_0149228 so that nobody else comes later and uses it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0149547_0149771 Yeah, and then you can use a timer as well.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0150148_0150198 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0157657_0157792 TV television movies.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0169295_0169374 You know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0173696_0175737 Generally, we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from 10 to 40. Right. And then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people with who have nervous problems.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0176300_0177029 In a family there will be an aged person, children and a middle aged person. But they cannot buy three different remotes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0177029_0177625 They would like to buy just one, which can be used by all the three.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0179221_0179323 How much is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0192775_0194536 But I have a doubt, will it be cost twice effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0195575_0195659 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0199939_0200079 within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0003972_0004279 Just put on my microphone here and we'll pay right with it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007539_0007703 Okay, you ready to start right now?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007998_0008644 Well, could you put my slides up because I think it might be helpful. We looked at the slides at the same time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009682_0009830 4%
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009830_0009886 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010847_0010963 I'm...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010963_0011958 Okay, well, I think we have introduced ourselves, so the functional requirements is part of my goal, but why don't we pass right to the second slide?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012069_0012334 That's where my discussion starts.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012334_0013030 Since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing, since I have to try to sell it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013030_0013619 I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013619_0014672 And the reason I just put that there like that is that in the initial stage, I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0014672_0015069 You could say anything you want, no matter how silly it sounds. It should run their cards.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0015069_0016531 it should heat up your motor, it should turn on your CD or whatever you want it to do. And then as we go on, what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0016562_0017633 So I'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's going to be to add a feature or how expensive it's going to be or if your time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0017633_0018011 It takes five years to develop this. It's just something we can't do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018011_0018921 So in the beginning, just have a big puddle of things that we, anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018921_0019778 And then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer, we'll try to then prioritize those.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0019778_0020047 So that was what I meant there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020047_0020887 And as I said on the slide there, consulting the industrial engineer about that. And the other thing is timing is really going to be as important as money.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020887_0021322 because if we're going to sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is Christmas present.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021364_0021801 25 euros, makes a nice little present, and we want it to be an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021801_0022222 We want somebody to see it and think it's, I just gotta have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022222_0022406 and take out their wallet and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022406_0022828 So it's going to be really attractive. But it's got to go to market by September.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022828_0023485 because anything that you don't have already out there in September, showing it around isn't going to sell for Christmas.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0023485_0026102 And then I'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color. I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026131_0026563 So we're coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026563_0027101 and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027101_0027851 what's gonna really be what they call the sizzle, because we've got to sell the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027851_0029054 A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just going to take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029054_0029206 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029486_0030625 I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at, the whole house idea really isn't going to be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0030625_0031175 So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we could suggest anything.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031175_0031708 I'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031708_0032924 not something like whole house control. And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0032924_0033501 at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work, the TV, the VCR,
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0033501_0034381 the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034381_0034459 I at this point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034568_0034638 I'm sorry.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038132_0038212 Of course.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038308_0038440 Ending.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0041820_0041895 I'm only going to be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042700_0042838 Alright, thanks for that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042838_0043738 Other things that I found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0043738_0044093 a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044093_0044900 And that was 34% and even more important, the thing that we did address in our last meeting, that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044900_0045388 So those are two things that we definitely do want to address.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0045388_0046099 We want to make it as simple as possible, we want to make it obvious and intuitive to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0046099_0047160 And then the things about finding it, we talked about the light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047160_0047734 And I think that those are things, after my research, that we definitely want to try to incorporate.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047734_0047873 Can we go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047965_0048737 Okay, so my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0048737_0049169 That is the selling point, the thing that's going to make it an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049169_0049802 Because once there's no be-back, well in sales they always say, you know, be-backs don't come back.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049802_0050107 If somebody says, oh, I'll come back and get it next week, you're dead.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050107_0050250 they're never gonna come back and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050250_0050983 You've got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now, now, now. Now is a big word in my book for selling this thing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051054_0051832 And in order to make it really saleable, we've got to shorten the winding curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051832_0052603 We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion. So that's why I'm saying simplicity is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052603_0052895 Finding it's important, obviously. You can't use it if you can't find it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052895_0053566 So we've got to concentrate on the features that help you find it. And I've already said this several times, but I put it down in writing here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053566_0053911 should be an attractive impulse purchase at 25 euros.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053911_0054476 So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it, they say, ah, 25 euros, I'm not going to take that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054476_0054921 has to be so great that they're going to say, oh, 25 euros isn't much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054921_0055696 And then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0055696_0055895 Okay, that's about it for me right now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0071650_0072292 Yeah, well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0075399_0075459 Like, integrate
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0083710_0083926 Yeah, well, they already did that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085300_0085700 That's good for a marketing point of view.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085700_0085982 You say that won't add too much to the budget?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085982_0086172 No, no, I don't think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0087557_0088267 Do you think there's any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088416_0088504 And I can move around.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088504_0088682 Because that might help with the marketing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0089144_0090328 Because we had something sort of sexy for adults. We could have something sort of silly for children, or a little elephant so they can remember where it is.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0093904_0094930 I think that's something that we'll have to discuss with the user interface person, because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0094930_0095705 I think one of the things people were complaining about when I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0095705_0096316 The changing modes was something... I mean, you and I, all four of us, we work with computers all the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096316_0096672 Changing modes is nothing for us, but people who...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096845_0096954 You know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0097752_0098520 It's the kind of thing people learn by feel. You don't feel the mode change.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0098520_0099118 So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help. Yeah shapes also different.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0099118_0100076 You know, like a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100076_0100251 But we'll get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100587_0100676 That's right, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100676_0100766 No, that's a good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0102143_0102905 you know that's that's a good that's a good one because the clock could be really friendly. When is your favorite show coming on?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103084_0103293 Yeah, a lot of times there's not a clock on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103293_0103559 and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103559_0103774 Yeah, that's good. The clock is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0114715_0115075 So we should visit the site and have a look at what's up there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116205_0116375 So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116540_0116634 Okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0117284_0117607 Did you go back to that slide where she had that slide up?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0118011_0118110 Yeah, okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0135833_0135885 맛있게 드세요.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0137802_0138030 And as John Rhys talked about,
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166276_0166737 Well, you know, there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166737_0168094 So if you design something that's very attractive to children, the mommy please, mommy please, we want it now, we want to go to the store and see it, that has a lot of marketing pull.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169274_0169314 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169762_0169980 I know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179007_0179132 What about the electronics?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179132_0179323 that's not really going to change much is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179406_0179688 That won't change much, will it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179808_0179911 The question...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0184362_0185216 That's right. And can we, is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185216_0185658 or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185658_0186120 the questions. The same electronics and basically all that's going to be different is the plastic case.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186120_0186575 And in that case, we could probably, molded plastic isn't all that expensive, is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186575_0186754 I'm here as an industrial person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0188725_0188880 There's a real idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0191056_0191112 If that ever happens.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0192228_0192322 an alternate package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0194615_0194841 I think the idea here is to do this.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0197756_0197905 Where are you? Finish reading now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0198506_0198918 Well, we may have to come back to more changes towards our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0200114_0200201 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0201029_0201159 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004216_0004299 Hello everyone.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004479_0004718 How are we doing?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004927_0005625 First we're going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0005625_0006870 In the last meeting, the marketing manager had presented her method of working, meaning gathering suggestions.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0006997_0007904 from everyone to see how she best could market this product within the budget that was given.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008138_0008820 In general, the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008975_0009457 Um, it's also an item that people lose a lot.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009457_0009814 So we should address that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009814_0010097 And of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010196_0010416 That is very simple to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010556_0011343 In addition to that, to make it sell, of course, the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011343_0011676 or like she says, put some sizzle into it in one way or another.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011777_0012321 so that the people are buying it now because in particular with smaller items.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0012321_0013004 That's a very important fact. Because if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013079_0013750 Also mentioned was it should have a very short learning curve.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013868_0014315 and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0014486_0015156 Our technical manager has then said that he feels we should have a chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0015303_0016034 that has infrared bits and it has an interface that controls the chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016141_0016636 Therefore, messages will be controlled in the same manner.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016636_0017055 There should be extra features like lit buttons, maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017055_0017265 if too many buttons are pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017385_0018387 child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018493_0018818 You could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018818_0019144 Also mentioned was maybe different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0019338_0020355 So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infrared bulbs, battery, chips, wires and maybe some kind of a holder.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0020468_0020854 for the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0021026_0022213 Francina, who is our interface designer, has mentioned that the...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0022213_0022856 of course should have an on-off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023009_0023561 particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't watch a channel that is undesirable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023561_0023683 It should be compact.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023683_0024093 Her personal favorite was it should be T-shaped.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024093_0024326 and maybe have an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024326_0024794 and the material should possibly be of non-allergic nature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025022_0025699 The different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025804_0026480 Maybe it should have an electricity saving feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0026583_0027722 and even possibly a timer so that people can program their favorite program right from the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0027908_0028452 Are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0028659_0029094 Okay, then we are looking for three presentations.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0029094_0029975 And I don't know whether the order matters much. I don't think so. So whoever wants to... I can stand first. Yeah, okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0030610_0030733 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0031419_0031552 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0032145_0032361 And that's number two, right?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037338_0037392 9.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037392_0037633 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037796_0037911 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037911_0037995 Ещё.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071148_0071367 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071367_0071681 Any comments on her presentation?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074229_0074411 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074936_0075179 No, I think these are her presentations.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0075179_0076320 But as far as the decision making, we can't even have to. But I just wanted to know whether anybody had anything to add to her presentation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076418_0076442 날씨였습니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076735_0076947 Who wants to go next?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077090_0077226 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077711_0077778 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0078760_0078872 compounds beside.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0098452_0098489 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130408_0130522 You have more pictures?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130522_0130739 We have five minutes to the end.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134033_0134113 Okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134248_0134577 Any particular comments by anybody?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0137498_0138269 We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0138383_0138486 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0151820_0152029 Uh, that's...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152200_0152485 This concludes the presentation of everyone.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152485_0153203 And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0153362_0154015 And so what do we think on the concept?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0154112_0154194 of the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0156370_0156455 That could be our...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0158654_0158929 Well, you teach, you have to teach.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0161998_0162607 Okay, before we get too far off here, the components of the concept is the energy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0162607_0162897 what kind of energy do we foresee?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0163699_0163926 Okay, then chip on print.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164176_0164267 and the case.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164267_0164756 And I think we all agree on the case we want to have something maybe bright, colorful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0165479_0165739 Granny designed compact and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166028_0166645 User interface concept, interface type supplements.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166960_0167250 I will pee your area.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0167951_0168227 I guess for yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0168722_0168921 I'm not sure what they mean by supplements.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169317_0169382 Oh, like...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169701_0169802 I like that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169802_0169923 Right, right.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171259_0171654 Our next meeting will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171654_0172685 and the idea is to, this is the individual actions to be taken until then, to have to look and feel design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0172871_0173724 And the UID is supposed to come up with the user interface design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0173847_0174301 and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0174301_0175288 In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay. It says here.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175288_0175809 you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175954_0177111 If you have any questions, you can always contact me or your coach I suppose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0177327_0178398 So I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in 30 minutes according to our time table.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0178752_0178832 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0004829_0004877 Good.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0040287_0040407 It's good.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077014_0077070 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077209_0077282 discipline.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077830_0078010 The next one. Oops.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0078010_0078122 It's just the world.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0079698_0080715 This time I am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0080715_0080945 Can you go over to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081013_0081722 I have just briefed down a few components which we require for the remote control construction
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081722_0082429 The first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery, etc, etc. It's like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082452_0082974 It can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong and
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082974_0083549 even if you just you know if you if it falls down then it does not break.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083549_0083753 So it should be strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083753_0084199 and there are no harmful materials used in that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084199_0084349 and it should be recyclable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084523_0085230 And also using of colouring compounds like if we want to have different colours
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085230_0085823 So, we have to use some colouring component compounds.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085884_0086444 And the second important thing is integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0086444_0087057 We can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087057_0087957 If it is not efficient, then everything is going to be less efficient. So, we should have a highly sophisticated one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087957_0088348 and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088348_0088688 suppose if it is 38 degrees outside 40 degrees outside
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088688_0089579 It should be able to resist the temperature, high temperature and low temperatures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0089579_0090048 And it should be equipped with a timer and alarm facility.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0090140_0092106 And the other component we have in the remote controller is a resistor, which is very, very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller. And also a capacitor, which is, I think it's like a battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092199_0092360 Can you go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092605_0093019 a diode, a transistor, a resonator,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093019_0093692 These are all the technical electronic components which we have to use in a remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093692_0094109 a battery, I would like to suggest one thing. If we
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0094162_0095016 If we will be able to make a rechargeable battery, then we need not go for a high performance battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095016_0095434 Even if it is a low performance battery, it can't charge much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095434_0095628 It's not a high voltage battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095628_0096094 then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096094_0096748 So in that way, we can cut the cost, but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096832_0097215 and we have a circuit board in a remote control build.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097215_0097446 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097446_0097754 and how it works, how the remote controller works.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097754_0097852 when you press a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098639_0098714 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098714_0098982 When you press a button, when you do that,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098982_0099792 you complete a specific connection. That means when you press a button there will be a small circuit underneath the button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0099792_0100604 and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0100604_0101397 Suppose you have pressed channel 1 button, number 1 you have pressed, then the chip will know that the number 1 button was pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101397_0101770 it produces a more scored line signal specific to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101828_0102181 Every button, every individual button has its own Morse code.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0102181_0103151 Suppose the user has pressed button 1, then the circuit will generate a specific Morse code to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103151_0103896 and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the LED, which translates the signal into infrared light.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103896_0104247 Like you have got a signal by pressing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104247_0104633 that Morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104690_0105088 Now that signal that MOS code has to be amplified by the transistor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105088_0105449 that is the use of transistor, transistor V which we use in the remote control unit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105449_0106205 It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the LED and which translates the signal into an infrared base.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106205_0106914 The sensor in the TV can see the infrared light and seeing the signal, it reacts appropriately.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106914_0107871 that when it sees the amplified Morse code signal, then it will know which what action it has to do.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0107871_0108100 then it will do the appropriate action.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108100_0108406 So this is how the remote controller works.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108608_0108739 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108818_0108950 I have few pictures
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108950_0109602 when you look at the remote controller, this is a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109602_0109775 And to the next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109916_0110176 and we had a few buttons and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110176_0110781 and if you open the remote controller you have this circuit board and few electronic components.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110781_0111206 Like you can see a chip there which is having 18 pins.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0111206_0112252 and also a capacitor, three resistors, and also resonator, and the diode transistor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0112409_0113165 the electronic components, all of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode transistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0113411_0114156 Yeah, you can see the TA 11835 labeled chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114274_0114940 You can also see the green, two green things are, they are resistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114940_0115695 And just beside that you can see a transistor and the cylinder shape, that one is a capacitor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0115695_0116236 And also there are resistors, sorry there is a diode.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116236_0116386 Can you go on to the next?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116498_0116663 So this is the circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116663_0116861 The green one is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116861_0117506 Actually building a circuit board is pretty easy and also it's inexpensive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117506_0117850 It costs less than what you print on a paper.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117850_0118489 Because when you are building some circuits and also wires,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0118489_0119311 it is better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119311_0119607 nothing like you know you don't need to use wires and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119607_0119842 It's not exactly wires we are using.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119842_0120132 It's just printing something on a board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120132_0120531 those prints will act as wires and circuits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120671_0120979 So that green thing is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120979_0121709 And also you can see there are like access for buttons like when you press a button,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0121709_0122749 the circuit under the button will be activated, it will get some signals from it and it will send the signals to the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122749_0122929 integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122929_0123067 in which connects.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123124_0123528 So these are the circuits underneath the buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123528_0123781 Can you see the black round marks?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123781_0123904 they are disincubed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123998_0124113 Excuse me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0124113_0125076 We have designed, before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0125076_0126004 But a push button requires a simple chip underneath it, whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126004_0126666 Like for schools we have to go for a sophisticated and full, complete shape.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126666_0127306 And as energy source we offer a basic battery, more engineers a hard dynamo.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127306_0127968 a kinetic provision of energy. Modern watches that you shake casually to provide energy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127968_0128534 So that also we can have in a battery. Or we can use solar cells.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0128993_0129358 The product can be delivered in different cases.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0129358_0130124 Usually the case is uncut flat that we see usually a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0130672_0131029 Yeah, maybe I have just one more slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131214_0131805 Like we can have materials such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, but titanium we cannot use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131805_0132583 And also for electronics we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the print.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132583_0132975 Also, it includes the infrared sender.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132975_0133592 And for the movie just to develop a sample sensor, sample speaker.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133716_0133830 Yeah, translation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133922_0134042 so I feel, you know, encouraged.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135352_0135967 No, no, no, the scrolling was different, like you can go for switches, like buttons, or scrolls.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135967_0136326 which we used to do 10 years before, I think.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136326_0136783 Now nobody uses it because you need a sophisticated chip and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136783_0137172 So I think it's better we go for ordinary buttons. We'll just go for buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0137172_0137325 Yeah, we have push buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0155951_0155980 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0156682_0157287 But I am very much doubtful how far it will work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157287_0157809 because speech recognizer has a small distance problem.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157856_0158196 Yeah, it's not distance problem. It's recognizing a person's voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158196_0158744 like maybe different people will be having different voices so like everything.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158875_0159324 So to get a good recognizing system it is a frustrating.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0160727_0160814 Yeah, but I've
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0164914_0165021 Try and do three.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0165087_0165205 Translated to say that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167428_0167885 like the switches, like we use buttons for user interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167992_0168050 push buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0169896_0169937 촬영기자1호
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0178831_0178919 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0021374_0021488 Interfaced.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0029733_0029926 Yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0030545_0030674 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0032580_0032667 I just feel three.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0033756_0034196 As an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034196_0034711 how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034904_0035003 Next, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035170_0035689 Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035689_0036777 This message could be a switch on off message, a switch to next channel message, a swapping the channels, a switching on to a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0036777_0037125 like you can have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 up to 9.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037733_0037769 Let me
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037914_0038091 Yes, nine numbers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0038297_0039313 And then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels. If you don't want to see the third channel, you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0039580_0040685 then it should have a next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0040685_0040793 Next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041040_0041593 Then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041810_0042459 then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0042459_0043076 For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have subtitles in English.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0043076_0043969 Then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044193_0044767 then there should be some buttons which can control features like the color,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044767_0045303 color of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0045677_0045873 Now there should be a memory switch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046272_0046472 There should be a mute button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046472_0047301 Suddenly if a viewer gets a telephone call and he doesn't want to switch off the TV,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0047301_0048236 But he can reduce the sound. He can bring the volume down. And he can watch. While talking, he can watch the TV.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0048236_0048884 Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049045_0049572 It's an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049852_0050709 So remote can be designed which can have the voice recognizers. You can record your own voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051039_0051517 which can be recognized by a voice recognizer in the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051517_0052189 If you want to see the 9th channel, just say 9th channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052189_0052811 The remote will automatically switch to the 9th channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052811_0053586 So the TV will have some recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0053586_0053930 So this is one of the very important features a remote control can have.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054117_0054527 So this is one of the interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054720_0055229 a very simple interface which has all the important features.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055337_0055442 Please, next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055573_0056263 These are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056263_0056861 And sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056861_0057360 So you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057360_0057596 Even a kid can use that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057596_0057810 So can you go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057900_0058505 Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0058505_0059282 And this has multi-purpose use. It can be used for TV. It can be used for cable satellites. It can be used for VCR, DVDs, and audio.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0059519_0059766 And this has inbuilt voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060165_0060335 Getting down to the next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060335_0061014 Now this is an interface for a child, for a remote which a child can use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061014_0061664 This is user friendly, it's very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061664_0062022 And this comes with different colors, different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0062692_0063723 And this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0063815_0064076 attractive child interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064655_0064779 Next layer please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064779_0065694 Now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066114_0066729 I could lose that in a minute. This is very big, you cannot misplace it anywhere.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066729_0067250 So this is the Jumbo Universal Remote Control and it's impossible to misplace or lose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067389_0067648 This is one such interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067837_0068986 And the personal preference would be to incorporate speech recognizers which will respond to users' voice for a particular function.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0069197_0069294 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0072873_0072896 MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0075564_0075593 weekend.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0108382_0108416 and we'll see you next week.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0113958_0114005 Uh,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0137241_0137310 are in.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0154766_0155184 Yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0155994_0156254 This could be one feature which could be sellable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159121_0159844 No, it is like you are recording a question already.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159844_0160229 and then you're expecting an answer from, for example, you have a TV system.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160229_0160992 I am the user and my family members are the user. I will already record a question like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160992_0161438 Good morning, like around 8 o'clock. I want to see the news in the television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161438_0161756 So I'll say just good morning and the TV will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161756_0162029 It will recognize my voice and it will switch off.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0164881_0164970 Go on, Faye.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0165119_0165290 and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0167885_0167954 push buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0168978_0169657 Some things like different types of features buttons. You can have a mute button. Or like Chris, be sure to use it when you also use something.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0178837_0178885 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0028468_0028599 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065632_0065748 You don't know me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065748_0066286 I could lose that in a minute.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072037_0072494 Well, looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072494_0072892 No suggestion is bad.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072892_0073178 but we're going to have to narrow it down a little more.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0073178_0074006 I don't think that we can get... The T-shape is good, the child one is good. It's too big to misplace. I think it's just funny.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074006_0074814 I don't think that's going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074814_0075047 It's gonna be a little bit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075159_0075207 Yeah, but.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075476_0075617 We'll have to come back to that later.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0076254_0076643 No, I think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0084611_0084654 Good point.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0128530_0128654 Ah, that's interesting.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0134648_0135275 On the scroll and the push button, you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0137109_0137442 We'll just go for push buttons, for interest of cost.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138188_0138348 I've already read my first and my next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138641_0139591 All right, my method is I'm interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0139591_0140222 So I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140222_0140793 I spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140793_0141346 And then when I'm out in people's houses or meetings or anything like that,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141346_0141886 I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141886_0142148 And I would encourage you all to do the same.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142148_0142685 And my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142685_0143016 People like something that really fits in their hand.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143016_0143144 Simple is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143144_0143839 They don't want to have to squint at small print. They want buttons whose functions are obvious.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143839_0144355 and they want as few buttons as possible, and they don't care for the mode thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144355_0144558 They want each button to do something.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144558_0144676 And eye catching is important.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144676_0144923 It's got to look cute. It's got to look appealing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144923_0145145 I'm trying to finish fast for you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145145_0145782 And our preference is, as far as I'm concerned, we've got to get to the market before the competition.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145782_0146250 Ours has to look really great and it has to come out before the others.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146250_0146840 so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146840_0147354 and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0147354_0148032 If we try to sell people it has too many great features, the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148032_0148872 We've got to narrow our selection down to two things I think that we're going to say are really great about our new product.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148872_0149481 And I've been looking around at what designs, every year different things are popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149481_0149939 And in my research this year, I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149939_0150324 And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150324_0150982 They're more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150982_0151470 So those are things we want to look at as far as saleability of the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0154519_0154897 You want to try to come back to yours? Yes, I would like to.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0155631_0155945 So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156276_0156529 Yeah, that could be our star feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156529_0156793 That might be really good.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0157714_0157817 distance problems.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163036_0163363 I think battery. I think we all agreed on that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163363_0163659 That's going to be most cost effective and the best thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0164816_0165230 bright, colorful, trendy design and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0168945_0169070 So
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169264_0169694 Yeah, or like crispy shrimp in issue would also be a supplement.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169694_0169928 Right, right.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0170012_0170726 Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible, pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0176912_0177406 Where were they hiding?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0003938_0004133 Well, hi everyone again.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0004324_0005440 Like before, I have to review the minutes from the last meeting. And so, here we go.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0005591_0006464 It was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0006567_0007903 designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the TV.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0007903_0008979 It should have 9 channel buttons, next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, color, contrast, sharpness, etc.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009020_0009435 We have a memory switch, a mute button in case the telephone rings or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009435_0010653 Speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to be integrated in this new remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0011091_0012013 Should be child-friendly design with few buttons, colorful, maybe with star-shaped or other shaped buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0012013_0012926 She presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013217_0013332 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013485_0014410 But her very personal favorite, really, she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0014410_0015315 The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0015315_0016438 She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colorful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0016564_0017116 should have an integrated circuit port that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0017284_0018010 She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0018010_0019144 Technically, this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode, transistor, resonator, and if possible, a rechargeable battery.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019263_0019471 and of course the circuit board.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019599_0019852 and how it works, you press the button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019852_0022001 the chip is Morse code related, relates to the generator amplification. And the circuit board is very inexpensive to build. And so she thinks this is a great feature to consider.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022216_0022696 She would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022804_0023264 The scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0023384_0023891 should be battery operated and of course should have special cases.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0024040_0025146 The marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0025146_0026273 has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0026431_0026654 easy to use and it should be eye catching.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0027036_0027745 From her point of view, of course, one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0028058_0029057 To do that, maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on, or in other words, on which our campaign could be built on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029213_0029697 Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029697_0030149 So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030288_0030916 It should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030916_0031126 She feels that's really what people want today.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0031293_0032097 The decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0032218_0033189 The energy should be battery, should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong and should have buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0033325_0033798 And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes, from the last meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0034072_0034535 Now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0042922_0043023 Mm-hmm.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0046331_0046436 D?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052178_0052253 What kind of button?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052399_0052600 a menu, a one, one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064279_0064480 Yes, the buttons are all raised, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064566_0064651 race and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0065317_0065522 Two hands
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0067081_0067808 Yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you don't have to first go like, oh yeah, I hear it all.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0069570_0069806 So if you're left-handed or right-handed, you can do that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072255_0072883 I have one question. Will there be anything written on the buttons?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072883_0073380 like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0073933_0074457 will have symbols so that the user really knows, you know, it doesn't have to be a good one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0074976_0075613 But anyway, it has to have some kind of symbols, text or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075772_0075805 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075924_0076155 Okay, I just want to make sure of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0076927_0077000 Right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079005_0079329 Now what are our special features for the marketing?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079329_0079718 That's really the voice recognition. That's really unusual.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0080276_0080937 and then the other thing would basically be shape or practicality of use
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0081109_0081159 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084293_0084575 Okay, now having said that...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084864_0085297 No, this was an evaluation criteria which we just have done.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0085297_0085576 Now we're going to talk about financing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086184_0086437 Well, there's a production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086485 that you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086604_0086809 but that's after the financing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086872_0086929 You see?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087539_0087996 Okay, we had looks and voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087996_0088686 Okay now on the financing we bring up the... there it is.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0088686_0089440 Okay, energy source, we say that's battery, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0089637_0089762 Okay, down.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090085_0090281 So we, I guess we use one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090983_0091358 Salad char, we were trying to change it to protective.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091358_0091446 Oh, that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091530_0091813 I told you I could just change it to a new label.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091913_0091984 Doesn't work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092731_0092979 Oh, okay. Let's see.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092979_0093328 Okay, one, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093328_0093443 I'll go away.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093443_0093918 So that's in the energy source, that's all we need.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093918_0094226 electronic simple chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094226_0094356 Is that what we're using?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094356_0094432 One of those.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094559_0094685 Come on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094685_0094872 Okay, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094872_0095121 Regular chip on print.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0095286_0095859 That's all we need. The one case. Uncurved flat, single curved, double curved.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096704_0096864 double curved
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096864_0096935 One of those.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097223_0097444 case materials supplements
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097444_0097645 plastic we said right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097826_0097962 Wood rubber.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098268_0098462 But yes, but...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098722_0099264 That's just for the case material. Special color, so we're having that, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0099509_0099901 And then we have the interface push buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100368_0100500 Scroll wheel no.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100500_0100770 integrated scrolling LCD display
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101319_0101533 Spot and supplement special color
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101770_0101856 special form
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0102276_0102552 And special material rubber wood, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103051_0103417 Total 7.6 whatever that means
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103665_0103782 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104079_0104235 8.2
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104683_0104824 That's...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104967_0105054 8.2, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105236_0105427 So we looks like we are.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105564_0105656 well within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0106093_0106272 I should save this I suppose.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0107999_0108108 Hmm.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108661_0108807 I just can't help.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108807_0108969 and a document computer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108969_0109144 I miss you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0109683_0109836 Okay, fine.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110140_0110431 Okay good, so that's the good news.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110431_0110834 You gotta be popular.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111164_0111424 So that, I think financing was pretty simple.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111535_0112165 Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0114600_0114759 You want to go to the next slide? Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131419_0131783 I just realized one thing. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131783_0132180 In the financing, there was no room for our voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0132429_0133181 And I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0133554_0133711 820, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134116_0134616 I mean maximum we have another 4.3, I mean 4.3.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134767_0135522 But we have no way of presenting that to management as a finished product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0135522_0136083 as a finished product and saying, okay, this is a voice recognizer that costs so much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136202_0136654 So we just have to be aware of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136654_0137085 I mean, and know whether the 430 will really cover that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0139488_0140779 I'm sorry to interrupt that, but I just remembered that there was no room for any special features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0140907_0141086 So be there on that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141086_0141328 You want to go to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141540_0141654 I don't know. God.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141654_0141780 Yes, it does.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0144286_0144428 I'll buy you a new set of
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0145622_0145736 I think you can make it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0148505_0148664 Yes, I think shape is one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0149756_0149886 You give the full.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150247_0150389 Um, I don't know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150516_0150699 I think I would give it at least a 2.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152596_0152725 Front right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152988_0153157 I like the colors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0154776_0154971 I think I will give it a 2.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0156922_0157788 Well, it's also you can't really try it out. The other things you have more, are more tangible. So from that point of view, but...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0158088_0158204 I'll give it a 3.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0163765_0164417 Here is what we're looking at, satisfaction, for example, room for creativity.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0164981_0165391 Is there room for creativity or are we absolutely happy?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0171858_0172740 I will always be bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still, you know, we probably can't
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0172740_0173341 With this particular item, you probably can't just add a whole lot of more things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0173341_0174395 We need to leave space, money-wise, for the voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0174986_0175438 So the question really is how do we feel this project process?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0175438_0176658 Are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0176806_0177143 I think personally I'm pretty happy.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177258_0177401 Um, and.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177613_0178216 And then the next question is, are we happy with the leadership of this project?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0178586_0179168 And I think teamwork was very, very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179398_0179899 And I think we are really happy with the means we used.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179899_0180315 We used whiteboard, we didn't use digital pens against all these things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180745_0180864 Yes, we could.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180927_0182201 It's maybe not in the best position in the room. Sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody. And I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0182303_0183135 Yes, I think so. I think absolutely and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183135_0183441 Did we find new ideas?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183441_0183527 So I think we did.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183727_0184471 I think we did in more than one respect and so I think we did very well here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184719_0184848 are the costs within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184848_0184947 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184947_0185232 Is the project evaluated?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0185367_0185861 Celebration. Then celebration!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186464_0186776 So I thank you all very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186776_0187153 I think this was very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187272_0187669 I think we did come up with a new product that's feasible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187669_0188086 feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0188280_0188412 So, thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0189421_0189660 I always get it off here. I'm not getting it off.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0190479_0190598 Oh yeah, we have time-
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035625_0035939 So this is what we have made.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035939_0036376 This is a model of the remote controller which we are going to build.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0036376_0038147 This is in a snail shape. So it is attractive and it's blue in color, bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons. So it is look wise it is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038147_0038429 and also compact in shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038429_0039128 And also it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039300_0039665 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039828_0041301 The material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and which is strong and also for the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0041445_0042426 The material is plastic and for the buttons it is a soft rubber. Oh that's good. Yeah. That's nice and fresh.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0042426_0042999 Yeah, because you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043039_0043332 And then for the lead.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043332_0044239 For the light emitting diode, it is a fluorescent green and it is a bulb like ordinary infrared.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0044413_0044878 And the button buttons part will be explained by function
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0062030_0062128 I guess.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0073522_0073605 These buttons were
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0074614_0074775 Going into an international market.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075161_0075253 has to have some
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075541_0076079 And then we have to do the final check.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0077042_0077318 On the snail shell, he goes right back into his cell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0078699_0078921 or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0094238_0094352 Is that what we're using?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0096277_0096347 This is the...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0098501_0098936 I think that is for the case material.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103508_0103763 I think that's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103915_0104042 Hı?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0108986_0109101 I miss you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133675_0133765 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133822_0134090 It was about four euros to go to spend.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138186_0138315 that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138953_0139031 Yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0140240_0140346 included
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0148666_0148936 Okay, good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151175_0151364 Even I can get a smile.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151364_0151441 explain to me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0153266_0153342 Yeah, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0155570_0155756 Maybe two?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0158869_0159019 Three
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165533_0165606 You're being nervous.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165682_0166106 Yeah, include some more buttons and features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166106_0166342 we can make the buttons few buttons smaller
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166342_0167206 I think they are quite big. So I think we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0167206_0167460 if we want to have more features in that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0168404_0168517 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0169338_0169663 instead of having two mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0177249_0177331 Um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0178437_0178646 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0180636_0180757 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0183540_0183677 Yeah, I mean...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0188433_0188521 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0189656_0189882 We still have some time left.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190111_0190291 You have
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190908_0190969 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0034881_0035112 Does they look alike? The button part I'll explain.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0044970_0045542 Now, we decided upon including certain features in our remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0045542_0046564 Now these features includes the signal emitting signal, it's the LED or LED, the infrared
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0046564_0046958 Now we have included the switch on and off button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0047312_0047703 Now we have included another feature that is the mute button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048112_0048363 on the side of the model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048363_0048767 Then we have included 1 to 9 buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048890_0049190 for controlling the programs, the different channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0049751_0050264 We've also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0050738_0051294 And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0051690_0052136 Now our model also contains a button which is called as a menu button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052259_0052337 मेनु बेट
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052416_0052502 Menu, menu, menu.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052613_0052695 at the center.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052836_0053649 We have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color, sharpness, brightness.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0053896_0054005 of this picture.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054300_0054709 We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054854_0055307 Now this is a special feature which we have included.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055307_0055379 At this button,
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055525_0056591 is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible. So if it is turned towards the right, it will take to the previous channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0056591_0056916 If it is turned towards the right, it will take to the next channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057045_0057353 to take the user to the previous and the next channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057662_0057755 swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0058428_0059316 Swapping is, for example, you're watching the second channel and then you go to the 10th channel. And if you want to go back to the second channel, you can swap.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059316_0059420 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059919_0060901 And at the end, this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer, which will recognize the user's voice, and then it will act accordingly.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061477_0061773 So this is a proposed model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061773_0061987 Now the marketing expert has to.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0062120_0062796 give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0063532_0063628 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0067684_0067788 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0068745_0069236 No, these, the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069236_0069323 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069916_0069948 반응이 좋지 않습니다.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069986_0070147 This is the menu, yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0070404_0071261 These two are to increase or decrease the volumes. Okay. And these two are to scroll the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0071408_0071569 Scroll up or scroll down the channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0073384_0074001 Yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0074001_0074203 That the user
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076128_0076730 And one more feature is we have a holder for this remote, which is an oyster shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076730_0076808 a shenshi.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076928_0077026 Right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0077093_0077224 He goes right back to sleep.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0078678_0078822 Or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0096360_0096459 すんごいか
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0098878_0098991 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0101930_0102129 Yes, we do have special funds.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0103669_0103947 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0104663_0104891 Nine points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0108498_0108598 in the test tube.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0123878_0124032 That's what people are going to get.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0138250_0138356 us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0140728_0140766 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0147847_0147931 You are so cute.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0155305_0155381 I'll get three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165536_0165724 We can always improve.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165869_0165978 features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0171906_0172054 always bearing in mind that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0178402_0178668 Yes, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0180493_0180786 a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0185498_0185849 Celebration!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0188429_0188486 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0190292_0190402 They say it's 40 minutes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0013037_0013522 She was challenged on that point.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0039502_0040024 You used to have all the buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0042228_0042451 Oh, that's good. Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0046289_0046397 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0052441_0052514 Is that your menu?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053828_0053902 of the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053902_0053969 好
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058041_0058417 The next channel in a numeric pattern or?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058778_0058833 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0059376_0059485 Okay. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0062821_0062982 Okay, well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063112_0063579 What I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063579_0064261 You can really hold it in one hand. You don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0064511_0065246 The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand, you can even reach it over here. So you don't have to turn it around.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065246_0065653 Turn it upside down. Two hands. Move it up and down. I really like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065653_0066194 You really did a good job on that. My little designers.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066194_0066948 And I like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066948_0067118 That's a really good. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067220_0067346 So that's really.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067786_0068008 The color is very attractive.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068008_0068633 These buttons around here are the mute,
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068759_0069052 These the front buttons which are here are the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069159_0069314 On both sides, please? Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069314_0069519 So you can push either one? Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069703_0069948 And this brings the menu up on the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069948_0070393 This brings the menu up on the screen. And the orange ones are...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071210_0071387 So often.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071387_0071489 परिश्ट
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071589_0071843 That looks like something I can sell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0072104_0072410 I have one question
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0074373_0074971 Good point, because we need the symbols because we're going into an international market. We can't have anything that's language dependent.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075356_0075447 Symbols.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075447_0075544 text or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076158_0076217 Feature
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076855_0077167 for the snail.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077167_0077358 He goes right back into his soul.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077358_0078888 Well, you know, I think we could do something really funny with this too, because the snail is known to be slow, and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail, or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0078888_0079032 That would really work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0079632_0080257 I think voice recognition is our big selling point because nobody else seems to have that in this price range.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0080981_0081579 Yeah. Well, I think that everybody's going to say that remote control is practical.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0081579_0082128 I think we have to dwell on appearance.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082128_0082331 you're really going to have the best day.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082445_0082708 cutest remote control on the block.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082708_0083555 So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image, play with the visual, and then the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083555_0083713 And I think those are the two things to push.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083713_0083762 The look.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083897_0084011 and the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084011_0084185 they're going to be our two selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084556_0084761 I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0085663_0086259 Ah, that's in my instructions. I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086517_0086566 Yeah, that's me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086744_0086822 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086822_0087076 Sorry.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0087076_0087088 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0089556_0089598 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0092477_0092677 Can you just fill in the yellow boxes?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0096533_0096673 I guess it's still occurring.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0097975_0098164 rubber because we're going to have the soft buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0098936_0099082 Okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0100797_0101105 No, but we didn't put the clock in it after all.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0112217_0112448 Okay, I'll take my file down so you can bring it up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0113791_0113889 Okay, she's gonna look at it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114272_0114502 Okay, I'll just move to the next slide real quick.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114688_0114846 Yeah. Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114846_0115717 Okay, well, obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first ask the big question, will it sell?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0115717_0116800 And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine-tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0116800_0117268 We can't accept every suggestion of course, but we just need to get a few.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117268_0117552 and show the prototype to consumer research groups.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117552_0118356 We don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118356_0118628 So we have to get some input from those people.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118628_0119064 And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition. We like it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119064_0119388 We think it's good. We're going to get behind it and sell it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119388_0119535 Next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119781_0120514 Okay, now the things that I was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120514_0120928 I wanted the shape to be biomorphic. I didn't want anything with angles and all square.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120928_0121283 I wanted to be comfy and roundy so we got that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121283_0121644 Size is small, the color is bright and warm, which is what we wanted.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121644_0122239 We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible. We'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122239_0122686 even though it's going to be hard plastic. It feels good in your hands, so that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122686_0123207 And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0123207_0124124 So paradoxically, the other features, in other words, the look, the feel, and the shape, that's what people are going to get in the store.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124124_0124344 They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124378_0124658 So they'll be our main selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124658_0125417 So those have been fulfilled by your prototype. And go ahead to the next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0125417_0126043 Okay, so the shape I think is a one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126043_0126301 It's really, really excellent shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126301_0127341 The size is small, and these points are in the importance for the marketing. These aren't in how I feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127341_0127967 I think that it's plenty small enough to sell, but I think we're sort of right, the scale is one to seven.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127967_0128408 I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128456_0128620 and our color, I think it's great.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128620_0128975 The colors are bright and warm and really do a great job there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128975_0129552 And given the constraints that we had, I think we got it as soft as possible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0129552_0130090 And then functionality, I think you did a really good job on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0130090_0131014 obviously we could have added different functions but then we disturbed something else. So I would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0131014_0131379 So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133143_0133582 Well, we had what, 8 euros 20 as our cost?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133730_0134107 And so we've got about four year olds to go to spend.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0134602_0134830 Well, um, that's...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137150_0137939 Well, as we know in today's technological world, you can do just about anything at any price. The problem is quality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137939_0138351 So we're just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0138351_0139103 And it may not be the greatest quality, but it may sell anyway.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0139103_0139488 as we've seen with so many of these kinds of products.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141252_0141534 Well, isn't this my last one?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141607_0141656 that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141656_0141844 Yes, it was.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142274_0142365 I'm going to...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142596_0142934 I'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142934_0143589 And we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now. So if you put my last slide back up there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0143817_0144241 I'm sorry.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0144660_0144894 Well, because I can't remember what I put on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145310_0145611 Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145761_0145853 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145937_0146050 Sorry.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146050_0146395 So, now we're all supposed to say what we think.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146395_0146789 Okay, so on shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147227_0147341 I gave you the one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147480_0147945 What would you rate it? One being good and seven being the worst.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147945_0148244 What do you think the shape is?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148244_0148497 Okay, that's it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148683_0149060 Okay, good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149060_0149273 And how about on sides?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149676_0149785 Oh, sorry.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149863_0150178 I give it a 4. I feel it's just average.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0151479_0152066 You're the designer, of course you love the new one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152066_0152323 And then how about how we do it on color?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152668_0152819 I gave it a wash.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152819_0153059 I really like all the sunscreen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153405_0153617 511, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153617_0153839 Här har vi också sin jobb.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0154126_0154680 taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hands.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155051_0155410 Okay, I'll give you three, two, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155687_0155789 You're watching what?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155919_0156691 And the next is functionality, where I admit I was a little hard on our team here, but...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0158686_0158775 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159432_0159557 Well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159803_0160156 Looks like we've got ourselves a pretty good product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0160156_0161362 Functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about maybe, heaven forbid, having another meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0161362_0161910 But otherwise, I think we're going to go with this product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0162068_0162501 Does anybody else have any other comments or any other things that you feel we should evaluate?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0167642_0168775 Well then again if we're going to do the speech recognition thing, there are going to be some buttons that are going to have to be added for that for the recording of the speech.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0168775_0169598 So that's where we're going to have to do, maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0169598_0170293 And then maybe we can do something with the...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170425_0170535 the volume control.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170535_0170789 you can put that all on one button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170918_0171804 and maybe consolidate some of the usage and see what we can do with that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0177170_0177576 I'm pretty happy with it. It's something I think I can market.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178213_0178697 I think you've done a good job. Yes, yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178981_0179274 I think we can be really good together as a team.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0180322_0180811 Maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182205_0182421 Use the slide because it was better position
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182537_0182670 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0183545_0183798 I think we were very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185190_0185260 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185896_0186554 Today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them we have champagne.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0188646_0188930 Watch out, I have my cord behind me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0190501_0191179 We were told we could end the final meeting at any time. Whenever we felt we were finished.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0191856_0192197 I'm taking your dress off, I'll get my microphone out for my necklace.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0192517_0192575 There we go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447 Mom's gonna drop that too, so.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812 Let's try something else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060 I think it's different than the Garfield.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246 i mi yw ychydig mwy o sgini
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553 クリームチーズをかけます。
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971 Well, it's supposed to be a cat.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118 I like it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106407_0106456 there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0107490_0107525 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0109049_0109083 I'm sorry.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0126778_0126843 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256 They were all mentioned.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673 Morning. Morning.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955 Let's see if I can find your places.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125 Are you ever just sitting on the right place?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629 I guess so.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003264_0003336 and the United States.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809 I guess I'll introduce myself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274 Everybody knows me as... I'm Hartford.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801 Let's start off with a little presentation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834 First I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037 You can see the field cameras there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797 They'll record our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416 There are also some microphones there, but you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014 because it will disappear when you don't attend to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424 This is our project documents folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919 There are some nodes in it already, I see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145 I'll start with the presentation kickoff.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968 We will have that redistricting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375 I'm afraid we've run a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227 Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for Real Reaction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529 It's a company in the Philippines.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476 We put a lot of effort into the design and the product itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865 I'm Mark Burt, I'm the project manager. So I'll direct you through the project.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177 This is our agenda.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771 We have an open-source grant for install training and Magic Plan discussion classes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902 Maybe I can sit down and I can take some notes. All right. Let's see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442 Maybe you can take the mains? Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136 I don't know, it's not a lot of work, it's just... If you hear something, just like that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525 As you can see, it's the opening.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917 Yeah, I think this is point fifth done a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314 Have you all seen the corporate website already?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701 Ydych chi wedi gweld unrhyw ffurfion?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949 I think I found one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019352_0019396 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753 Let's see if it works this time.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054 I'm not sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335 Okay. No problem.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274 But on the corporate information side, there was real remote instead of real reaction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934 Real Remote is not really the company we are, but...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335 Okay, what are we going to do?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735 Our project AIM, as you can see, a new remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113 It has the original, trendy and user-friendly.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811 So these are the points why we also hire G.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629 We've got the marketing experts for the trendy and user-friendly look.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214 and industrial designer that's also user friendly and original
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776 And we've got our user interface design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899 So, so.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206 That's about the new remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089 Our project method is, there are three phases we're going through.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568 First, I'll show you my design in a future work meeting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992 After the facial design, then the conceptual design, then the detailed design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683 I had some little indications over here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177 But I think you know it already by yourself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124 The industrial designer is going to work on the working design, components design and a bit of the look and feel design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102 The user interface designers go to the technical function design, user interface concept and user interface design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0031102_0032189 and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements specification, trend watching and product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473 Let's submit what you're going to do.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816 But that will be a whole work to us. All amazing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524 Then we've got our first tool training.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263 We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here, so it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870 As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here and the whiteboard.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579 In the whiteboard here is a little toolbar on this side.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682 Here are some functions.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790 As you can see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251 These features we don't have anything to do it only undo you can undo a little bit
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563 Piece of drawing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897 A blank new document for each person.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144 Select the pen eraser
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423 Catch you down there to do anything with.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867 Then we've got our pen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005 Respect.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928 It's really funny because you can draw with it in this way. In the form of.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305 You can also select the current color and align it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673 But first you have to select the BEM function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011 which we're going to work with in a minute.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873 It's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings in there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081 Then
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513 a short thing about the documents.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935 We've got our shared folder, project name.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279 project documents
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895 But you all found it already because there are a lot of documents in it already, so it will be okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697 And these are available on the smartboards as well. So if you have a document you want to show, you can just open it from the floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097 Here is the sample tool work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751 So I just have to say, print move back or forward one page.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947 Let's switch between the different colors.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479 And then we're going to try out the whiteboard.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119 So as you can see we're going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785 Just to get a bit familiar with it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932 Nah, it's a piece of friend in the way.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351 Is anybody playing with the map?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721 We're going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367 and just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213 The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different line widths.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607 Dus, ik kan beginnen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177 You can use this pen by holding it like a little child.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801 Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366 Another thing is you have to be a bit slow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895 I wonder if you got me to draw that really fast and then it won't hold up.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051895_0052898 Just for red color. I think gray is appropriate.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052898_0052990 Then alignment.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502 87 will be nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863 Now you'll see my drawing capabilities.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193 ご視聴ありがとうございました。
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579 You got to do it real slow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800 It's trying to draw a bull.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204 So good.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330 Yeah, I'm good.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775 Now we've got another function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063 Are you ready?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197 And I can do.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576 this.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878 That's good.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429 And I'm going to write down a few of his characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744 Yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469 Ik kan nu teksten doen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677 This is difficult.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107 Maybe I should have ordered a bigger one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408 That's the same.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073 I think that's it because if you want to do this, then you have to strike.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319 I don't know. Just try.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182 It's not mine.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320 That is.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929 Thank you. You want us to draw another animal?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068929_0068980 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319 This way then.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319 characteristic of that gold.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477 This with the...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194 So now I'm going to hand over the pen to you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838 Maybe it's easier to draw with a smaller line width, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126 Because this is going a little better than I did.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669 It's a real Dutchie.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081 I see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551 Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084551_0084628 Interesting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666 Yeah, just think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283 Is it your cat or did you find him on the street?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495 That's pretty good.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818 So everybody knows how to work the whiteboard now.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508 So if you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the whiteboard, just ask and go ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679 It's so amazing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677 I'm going to get you a cup of water.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990 So we've got the tool introduction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506 Moving on to the project finance.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430 As you can see, for a remote control, the static price is 25 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648 I'm shutting the prize.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946 Our profit aim is 50 million euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775 That's the least we have to get from our remote controls. So we have to work together to reach our aims.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717 We can do it international, so we have to focus on different kinds of users, different kinds of cultures and different kinds of trends as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143 But that's all in the later stadium.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933 Our production cost can be a maximum of 12.5 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883 So that's also a point we have to keep in mind when we want to make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060 One word.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394 So just try to remember these points.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393 The center price is 25, of it aims 50 million, but more important is the international market we're trying to focus on.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770 and production cost maximum 12,5 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275 So this leads us to our discussion.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783 You've got about five or ten minutes left for discretion.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140 So I'm going to sit down I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442 It's easier when you go last.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622 I've got a message.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120622_0120698 Five minutes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118 Okay, that's a good time. So just on a side note.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952 Maybe you have to say the magic word.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208 It's a dud.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553 Maybe you have to just clip it down.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122828_0122914 Back up again.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568 Let me just see that, too.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123733_0123799 itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948 It's pretty big on that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102 O que é que é isso?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649 Let's go to select those.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124998_0126251 But everybody has experiences with remote controls. I mean not the ordinary remote controls but also a little bit different ones.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555 I can use for other...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0127905_0127958 Bye.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777 Yeah, I've got one at home.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653 and you can program I think 8 different devices in it. You can use it for your television, anything else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326 And it also operates on infrared, so you have a little device inside your room.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868 And you can operate it from the third or second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716 So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs and you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893 So that's a pretty handy.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460 But only the
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401 I think if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133401_0133481 See ya.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757 It's good to remember.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250 Yeah, it's nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482 So we want different functions.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420 And we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720 But I don't know if it will exceed the production cost.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021 So this is something we have to find out, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893 Other functions for remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329 ゆーかのキツネ
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137725_0137806 Group.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500 So these are a few things we can think of.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030 I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040 So you can see better in stages.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726 That's an idea, John.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142726_0142792 Alrighty.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142928_0142988 E aí
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680 Any questions about this presentation?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793 kickoff presentation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790 Okay, then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048 And they can all work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405 Finish meeting now
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955 And we're just going to work on our own projects.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455 Okay, I'll meet you in about half an hour. Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639 .
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0076704_0076747 She's a good kid.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595 I'm just gonna draw its head.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089790_0089839 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352 Go ahead and do this.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097503_0097536 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097650_0097761 I love you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097848_0097894 Peace.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0098652_0098803 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099099_0099154 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539 Um, who said that?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802 Okay, handsome. Let's see it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126436_0126474 No way to get out.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126779_0126875 Yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751 Now the second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137604_0137671 Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110 What a cruel story.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494 You never know, I mean...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0141037_0141123 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004079_0004149 Marsfly.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004810_0004844 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0018307_0018353 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267 I can't say I pay much attention to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0021216_0021268 Oh yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0046928_0047006 That's interesting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892 without thinking about a short-
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0071206_0071246 What?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613 and control the lag.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584 Okay, not much of a linus, but here you go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833 This is my...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163 Oh, shh.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320 that you adopt animals and spreading that buzz.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084648_0084705 They are.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084935_0084977 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049 It's going really slow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144 They're really animals.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316 And that's just a little bit of me.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191 Good.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667 Garfield
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700 Thank you so much for watching !
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0110215_0110298 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120296 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414 So just on a side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0123611_0123667 So.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159 Well, it was mine.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124708_0124779 Oh, there we are.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126746_0126820 Well, yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508 kind of brought TV at home and a DVD player so we got like a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030 One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442 And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0130808_0130852 for you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967 So I think you can take my next senior.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0134155_0134240 That's Jerry John.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478 But that would be really good if we could do that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534 Because we shop...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045 My remote control tends to fall off.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381 Yeah, one other little thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763 I thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140875_0140940 So you can see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213 how much is left in the battery.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994 But they'll also really drag up the production costs. So we'll have to see about that too.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437 But maybe just a little bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0144083_0144179 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0145529_0145582 Let me see another one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0147202_0147250 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232 Well, I think if we're going to use a touchscreen, we're going to go way above the 12.5 euros.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266 so it wouldn't be very robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531 It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777 Okay, I've got a presentation about the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003 First, about how it works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099 It's really simple.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285 everybody else out of the co-workers.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468 You should press this button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999 The remote determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send a signal to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301 The TV switches to the frequency are not functioning.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811 So we've got the plate.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206 It's got conductive discs for every button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983 When the user presses a button, a signal gets sent, goes to the lab and transmits it to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340 It's a very simple device technically speaking.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614 So this is a schematic overview.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802 We've got the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017 Power source.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468 and when a button gets pressed it goes to the chip
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059 The chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324 When you press a button you can actually see you've pressed a button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094 Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441 keep the inner markings simple so it's robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841 I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301 because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky high.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105 You only have to design a remote once and if you use high-tech materials it comes back in every product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046 So in my idea it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073 I think that if we put our marketing right, we can sell this just like, I don't know if you've heard about it in the news.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281 the elderly mobile phone.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249 If we make a remote control, just with that idea in mind, we could make tunnels and all.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872 We don't have to focus on the design then, but on functionality.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940 Mücadelesi.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346 change our focus on the project.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636 We can sell this.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330 That's a good one.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275 And besides that, if we're going to focus on elderly people, they'll have to adapt.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548 they're not used to using scroll buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860 Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426 It should be possible, yes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604 It's not too fancy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913 And if the remote stays rather small it should be possible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902 So we're just going to focus on the extras.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548 like with a keychain if you want so it goes yeah it makes it sound
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974 I think we'll have to choose between the docking station and the screen console.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187119_0187191 So now it's still.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094 I don't think they have different television sets
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344 in every country.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002 Everybody finds place again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777 Okay, so this is our second meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100 And, uh, still fading.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726 Now we're going into the functional design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007726_0009245 The important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719 So that we can move on to the second phase.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959 But first this face.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273 There is an announcement.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705 There is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288 That's our ghost mouse again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018 That means that you can have a little trouble with air conditioning.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339 That's it, wing C and E.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853 So it should be out in a couple of days.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438 It's going to be cold anyway so I don't think we're going to do it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584 than our agenda.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747 backwards the old game
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911 This time I will take the minutes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375 You're going to have a presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502 All of you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365 And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769 So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354 and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291 and then the decision on the control functions which you want to include
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511 I've got 40 minutes for all of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947 So I suggest let's start with the first presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134 Who wants to do first?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337 So maybe it's easier if you, yeah, I think you will tell them your presentation as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787 which fiction you have and what are you going to talk about.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054004_0054103 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516 Anybody have any questions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829 And that's for show accordance.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054829_0054905 Okay, that's good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160 Yeah, I'll do the second.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571 Yeah, you can take your time.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860 Dwi'n mynd i fyny.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0058229_0058319 Good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638 problem as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610 Anybody has questions about the technical functions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654 Well, we'll see.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130 Maybe we can first listen to your presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669 And then we'll have a little discussion about the requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351 Ik denk dat ik het schoon doe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0102358_0102401 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926 Okay, now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we're doing right now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724 I am the project manager, so I am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739 We got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0106739_0107827 That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096 So it has to be simple.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600 Another point is we have to skip the data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108600_0109601 Because in the world of upcoming internet, we think data text is going to be a thing of the past.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069 And it's a function you don't need in our remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739 Internet is also mentioned. Just go in a function you can use.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063 Maybe also on televisions it will be available as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672 Another one is the customer is 40 plus.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578 That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257 This is a bit pity for the marketing expert.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682 Because he was aiming on the younger persons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200 So we have to find a market which is above 40 plus, but which will suit our
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648 remote control and the other way around.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449 And we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026 So it has to be visible in our design and the way our device works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572 And we have to be very clear on this point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721 So I suggest.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215 Let's have a discussion on the control function.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0117632_0118925 We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091 against the not dead text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559 É fácil.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107 Pretty
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383 I think we can not.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238 I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970 If we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577 Because it is 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305 And if you look in Holland, the whole generation of 40 plus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992 50 plus, it's the biggest share of the whole population now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668 Don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market,
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456 that people think that's the device I've looked for although I didn't realize it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604 So let's try it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136353_0136447 It's a big success.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731 remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367 We don't have to focus.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011 Dwi'n meddwl...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830 that the new products we are going to make are simply designed
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726 are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0140860_0141918 And I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419 Because what you told, channel selection is important.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809 Volume selection, power and data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055 No, we haven't voted yet. I think that text can be...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587 And the functions as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776 But only if he's on.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134 higher the cost
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705 Because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well, but I don't think that will be a problem.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019 Where is the text?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751 So I suggest definitely.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374 Is anybody really against data tax?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956 Just keep the text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477 It's good idea as well, especially for the subtitles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786 Maybe we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123 Make that, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725 Another point of advantage in our remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587 If we make a button for example for big subtitles, which is instantly on the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173 For elderly people that they can think, oh I want to have subtitles, push the button and they get the big subtitles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064 So I think that this can be very useful and advantage.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617 Functionality should be few buttons, you said.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239 I think that's very important. We have a few buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701 So to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318 I mean, so is yours.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219 You don't need it. Do you need the buttons for one to cheer up?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339 Maybe incubating an inclusion.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911 belki de
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797 Maybe you can implement the scroll button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154 or a joystick like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450 There are other ways too.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649 If you look at telephones.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168 the sony telephone and scroll which is very useful
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0163536_0163590 Yes, sir.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236 This is the numbers there.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076 We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display and if it's too much we can reconsider it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328 But I think that one needs very much presence.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493 But I don't think
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813 The number of problems.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082 I think it's very important in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763 You can make a very fancy design by putting the buttons in the right places.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041 If you have less patterns you can do a lot more with.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339 to operate on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393 So we can.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172982_0173031 That's right.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434 So you suggest we could better focus on, for example, the document station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717 like other functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210 instead of less burdens.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671 Do you think the docking station will...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115 is allowed in the purchase we have.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504 It's not too far.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153 I think that's a...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456 That's a good advantage point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363 So if we have a fancy looking docking station or... That's a nice requirement.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0179483_0179580 station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0180046_0180112 I think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259 That's a good boy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868 You said they easily get lost as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939 So maybe we should implement the audio side or something.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706 So we're just audio the signal should be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126 I think it's not too expensive.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279 Another...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692 The LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591 I don't know if that will rise the cost too much
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291 So we can watch.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015 Just the LCD.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170 Just a normal screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190317_0190417 Small screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679 to some extra info.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060 I think that's a good idea as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584 It's the smallest green video.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580 سببت الدين فا
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270 I think it should be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639 Let's see, what did we say?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233 Should be fancy design, easy to learn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469 Few buttons, we talked about that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768 documentation lcd
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087 General functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280 Default materials
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196452_0197489 I think that's a good idea as well because other people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688 So it doesn't really matter.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944 So any problems?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316 Let's specify the target group.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966 Are we talking about elderly people or people from 40 to 80?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687 Because I think what we're going to design is for people above 60, maybe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201043_0201135 What do we want?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925 If we want to profilate this with, for example, the telephone for elderly people, we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252 targets are real elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905 So I didn't steal it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535 And you're talking about 6280, for example.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642 and different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205642_0205713 Barbie.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008 We've got five minutes left.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0207008_0207094 And with that, I'm going to turn it over to you, Mr. Chairman.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360 in different languages.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085 Or you have to put a language that will be better in this case.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464 It's better to put it on different markets.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880 So that's the third.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323 Then a few small things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808 Okay.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226 I will put the minutes in the project documents folder.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102 What we're going to do for the next meeting is the initial designer will do the components concept.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432 Here's the interface design, we're using interface concept and the trend watching.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212458_0213492 So just keep in mind things we've said about the target group and the requirements and the trends which were going on.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955 and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385 So thank you for this meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656 And I think we have a lunch break now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936 So that's a good thing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139 Okay.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775 Of noem ik het, usuale interface of iets?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117 for the techno functions of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215 I think we must use the general functions of remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0059215_0060963 I've done a little research on the internet, and I don't have much information about it, about the interface.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113 I've been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844 So you got a lot of devices like DVD, television, stereo.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948 감사합니다.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317 but it must be user friendly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041 Je kunt veel functies in één instellen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588 Everyone, remote as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064588_0064676 But...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479 Um... yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318 I've got many functions in one remote control, but you can see this is a quite simple remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014 Ik heb een paar bedden, maar deze remote control heeft veel bedden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502 yeah people don't like it so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347 I was thinking about keeping general functions like the array.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665 like the on off button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974 Keep it like a redbird.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596 en iedereen weet het, dus je hoeft dat niet te veranderen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183 personal preferences
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706 We gebruiken een display voor de speciale functies van de verschillende apparaten.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070706_0070792 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491 What I was thinking about was, you've got...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217 This is the remote control. You got here the general functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145 Dit is de on-off-knop, de geluidskamer, ik weet het niet. Hier heb je een soort display.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438 It's a touchscreen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074438_0075919 Je hebt een generele functies van de app voor je DVD speler. Voor het spelen van versieringsdata.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452 Hier hebben we de echte knoppen voor het selecteren van een device.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0076586_0078034 So this is better than DVR. For every device you got a part display of buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621 Dus je hebt nooit alle knoppen op één apparaat.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045 So that's my idea about it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323 Um, yeah and...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706 Uh, let's see.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945 So that's good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395 En de echte knoppen die we moeten gebruiken zijn
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994 We better use quite large patterns for...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294 everybody has to use it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664 Oude mensen, jonge mensen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268 So the Muzzle Keeper buttons are quite simple and quite large.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577 Sure.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082833_0082896 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237 Dit was mijn kwartier.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751 You got quite a cheap touch screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069 It's not in the quarter or something.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648 It's just one call.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683 Ik stond een paar weken geleden op internet.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961 Because, yeah, it's quite...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685 Dit is een soort touchscreen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287 20 euros or less
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515 So, it's possible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0089662_0089761 Yes, sir.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395 Deze dag moet de deafdier een tekst voor de ondertitels hebben.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506 So it's, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0150585_0150660 or elderly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617 I mean, if it's only for TV, you're not going to get it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713 We can't skip this play, so we don't need it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000 to live.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0018276_0018355 I think I'll go first.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813 My name is Frank Trampolo.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965 and your market experience.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091 Göran.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426 I've done some research.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302 We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556 We'd love to fill out a questionnaire.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822 We have 100 of these test subjects.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220 In addition we did some market research.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526 see what the market consists of.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664 what ages are involved.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460 Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753 Remotes are being considered ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963 75% of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633 people in the costume indicated that they thought the remote ground was ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285 An additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733 In addition, remotes were not very functional.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332 50% of the people indicated they only use about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939 And 50% of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028233_0028307 sonst bin ich
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894 Then we did some research to do most relevant functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664 Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867 The power button color line.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117 And dental techs go to the 6 o'clock.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222 So these are the most.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700 most important functions of remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927 Then there are some one-time use functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087 That's what I like to call them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550 There are the audio settings, video settings and channel settings buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074 which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702 Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943 168 times per hour.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502 And this is the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115 16% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874 The main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical under remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285 They like to use new functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438 but they also are very critical.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637 They won't spend their money very easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423 The users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731 They are not really very interested in features.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997 but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811 Well, I think this indicates for.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336 I think we should make a remote for the future.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480 And this means forever.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984 I have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938 This also makes up the biggest part of the market, so that would also be where our main profit would be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342 This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614 The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that remote control caused RSI.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217 This is certainly something to take into account.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921 And 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate a new remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379 So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672 Besides of course that the remote must look very nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933 functionality.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727 As a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons. I think we should make very few buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175 This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670 I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162 especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539 because they are used most, so they should be robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695 They shouldn't break down easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851 Then, as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, it might be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678 And I say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985 but it might be a good idea to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629 This would get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890 so you know where it is in the room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392 And in addition to this, it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0050571_0051711 then a surprisingly great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826 This was.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436 mostly people in the age of 16 to 25.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805 But up to 45 remains feasible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574 This would also greatly increase the production costs, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0053859_0053925 That would be a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0054420_0054490 Questions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050 And you should go to the top thingy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058050_0058150 Slight shoe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058150_0058187 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837 Well, we certainly make a fancy design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089544_0089606 That is true.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796 So is there any discussion possible about the requirements?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896 You're saying that TiltFX is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used anymore anyway, pretty soon?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197 and new TVs will have internet access on them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863 But I think if you're targeting people of 40 plus, the chance that they will have a TV with internet access.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278 within the next like 20 years is very slim.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133 In addition, people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543 So I think it's pretty dumb to put no-tilt-detect's feature on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840 I'm pretty much against it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878 Besides that, I think the market for 40 plus is like.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123983_0124063 Pretty small.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873 But I think we're just going to go for another.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439 We cannot innovate.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125565_0125638 I think we can do it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298 Yes, but it's not the biggest part of that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973 Besides that they're not very critical. So I mean they don't really care
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315 what the remote control is like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688 It will just pretty much take the first thing I see and which looks acceptable.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961 I think that would be the case in the.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414 16 to 45 age category.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077 because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605 people
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976 As soon as it works, it's okay with them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610 If we make a...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275 But obviously the board tends to disagree.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146351_0146443 So
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971 I think it would definitely be a bad idea not to include it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038 I don't think that's really an issue anymore.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154163_0154263 Well, might be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858 I mean, if it's only for TV, you're not going to need a lot of buttons anyway.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329 You know the 1 to 0 button, next channel, previous channel.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821 volume up, volume down and some teletext buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360 I mean, no way.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508 I think if you're going to include teletext, you do.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740 I think many people like to use that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506 If you want to switch from channel 1 to like 35, you don't want to push the next channel button 35 times.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525 That's true, but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089 I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238 And so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899 The TV would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220 I don't know if many channels
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162420_0162508 Do have that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612 Many TVs on.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063 But I think if you're going to make a remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497 having as few buttons as possible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313 Because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV, which already only have the minimum number of buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540 I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001 That is true, but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you're making a remote control only to operate only the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897 Because if you have a remote control only to operate a TV, there's simply not a lot of buttons required.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553 There's not a lot of functions required, so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184 So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602 marketing
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173040_0173099 which was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663 one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845 Yeah, I think, I mean, we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153 But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428 Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research into
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733 what other people like to have.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039 like to have X-ray and remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443 Yes, well, 50% of the people indicated that the remote control tended to get lost.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188 Iawn, dyna'r hyn rwy'n ei gynghori.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919 You have it on some phones too, which have a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252 And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0184328_0184403 So it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701 I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355 and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928 It might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, which will explain a button if you press it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068 which would tell you what it does.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747 And it wouldn't have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469 Just a small screen and a tube.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307 I don't know
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635 It was a dream.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437 I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0201108_0201183 I think
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807 I think that would be, if we should do something like that, it would be...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198 I think it would be really good for the image of the company.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681 And I think there would be good market for it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211 So we're able to really bring an innovative product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648 Yeah, 3.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196 I have to look into that a little more.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517 and with the little screen in it which explains the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794 I think it would be a lot easier to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113 adapted to different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0214713_0214775 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673 Dat is de components design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321 For the energy source we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829 kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360 but if we choose for that option the docking station could become obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601 so I don't think it's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583 For the casing the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing, single or double curved casing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859 It's really up to the design that we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347 It doesn't imply any technical restrictions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153 As a case supplement you could, I thought of that later, a rubber belt, like an anti-slip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677 For the buttons we can use plastic or rubber.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326 And the chipset, it says simple here but it should be advanced because we're using an LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026 And as the TreadWatch presentation shows, people like wood.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725 but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image unless we would start to draw the lines.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913 Vooruitvouder van het geraadwoord.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554 Well, the kinetic energy source is rather fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817 but depends on what we want.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047 I think we should discuss that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706 For the case, the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523 And the chipset really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0091523_0091576 That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992 Yeah, there are four options.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273 You could use the basic normal battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436 hand dynamo
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719 But I don't think that's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113 You don't want to swing before you can watch television.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261 solar cells
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667 but not every room is very light so it's not a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099667_0099767 or to connect again.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754 You basically shake your remote and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101742_0101816 That is true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402 I don't have any informational pricing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632 So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810 That would also go for the LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165 bit higher percentage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714 And that's the best choice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947 Well, there isn't any choice there because we're using the display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100 So it's got to be advanced.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305 I'll have to research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060 Well, the general, like most older remotes are flat, just straight.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699 And our manufacturing department can also do different single curved or double curved cases.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622 It would just only affect the form for a far off sign.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003 So it's really just up to the design department what we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236 It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537 Big one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534 I think we should start by choosing a case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785 Because that's the basis of building up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151 Got the flat case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358 from the side so.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993 with a single curve, so I'm not really sure what they're going to look like, but I think it's something like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632 So this type should be better for you or better should prevent a stray injury a bit.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274 and the doker, something like this I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600 So those are the three options we have.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185 It's more logical to have it on top as well, because like on your mobile phone, it's always on top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030 Maybe you should just start on the black bed.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425 Good afternoon.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837 There's a clear meaning already.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093 I hope you enjoyed your lunch.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346 And this is the way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602 Let's do that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309 Really?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844 Okay, this is the second phase we're going to discuss today.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162 Het conceptuele design meter.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095 And a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409 Dat zal de specification nog niet zijn.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622 and also trend watching.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580 These are hopefully the points you addressed in your presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215 First, I'll show you the agenda.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404 First the opening
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621 Now we have three presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142 After that we have to come to a decision on the remote control concept.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383 Are we going to make it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600 And then we're closing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800 About 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221 So I suggest let's get started.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747 Did someone encounter any problems during the operation?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182 25.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011182_0011256 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177 Then a little thing about the last meaning.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469 These are the points we agreed on.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758 the new finance and the target market.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012758_0013769 And requirements are, uh, text, docking station, audio signal, small screen, and some extra button information.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987 And we are going to use default materials.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661 Does somebody have any comments on these requirements?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611 These are just things we thought of, so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else, just let me know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755 Maybe you can work it out.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334 And we're going to target the 60 to 80 year old customers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402 So now everybody knows what we're doing. I suggest let's get started with the presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012 So, making the same line as last time.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452 Good luck.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736 Any questions about the trends?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365 Okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0091739_0091784 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432 So that brings us to the discussion about insects.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825 So these are the points we have to discuss.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318 First...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021 I think we can talk about the energy source since that's a
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908 has a pretty big influence on production price and image
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011 So
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927 I think first of all we have to see if it is possible to introduce kinetic energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077 Well, I think it's true. Elderly people just like to have everything in place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773 And I don't think they like a remote just laying everywhere in their rooms.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157 So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369 And also what you said.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186 You can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964 but I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441 So you have a button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214 And then we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the channels.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396 I'm wondering
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198 It's not great.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477 Good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791 Jesus.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961 I think it's a good point.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054 I personally think the LCD screen we want to use with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507 It's just some extra information and it's easy to ignore as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757 But if you don't want to use it, you just don't use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889 And yeah, I think maybe we have to discard the voice recognition.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431 because it will increase cost significantly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946 And I don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372 So that brings us back to the energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126 if we don't have voice recognition it won't use a lot of energy to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356 So in that case we could use kinetic energy. But I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466 and much cheaper as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353 okay, I will just choose for the battery
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484 It brings us to the chip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847 We're using the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465 Okay, that's fast.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455 And then we get to the point of the case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119 Which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652 If you want to choose for wood or black and grey.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732 Or both?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723 As we saw there is not, yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033 But I think it will attract all of the people who want to have something exclusive, which they can show off to their grandkids.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275 Got a new remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399 That's right.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850 The woodcutter was a lot more expensive.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038 Yeah, man.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515 I think surely because, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064 It's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896 in certain cases.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413 I need to set the gaze.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794 I think that's a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768 Because then you can advertise as well with give your grandfather a new case for his remote control or whatever.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796 Because it's something extra, it's something other remotes don't have, which we can get a greater advantage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959 So by then you can make them with color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145 black and gray on the canvas as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770 So you suggest we should design two different telephones?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830 on which you can apply different case covers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767 So everybody is okay with changing covers?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059 I think that's a good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555 Changing case gloves.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318 but the form has to be...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677 It has to be possible to stand up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912 Oranges
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416 and the cover of the docking station is also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749 on top of the television then.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158749_0158792 I know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180 Yeah, you can do that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369 It's okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722 So the interface
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048 What type of interface do we want to use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709 Maybe we can make a little drawing of it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144 on the board.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381 Somebody have ideas for a forum or?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252 ychydig yn anodd.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349 But you have extra buildings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495 so people can get confused.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086 especially if they have the same writings on them.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234 Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173340_0173417 All the same.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789 functions as the normal one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194 Then you'll die.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292 And then you're good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482 Here's the Mercedes green.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107 I think.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553 I love someone new.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069 No, it's very indie, I think.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520 because the plus and the min will be opposite.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813 That is the thing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349 Maybe it's... yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117 But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262 I think the functions are...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981 that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589 So, so well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961 I think we can just leave it the normal shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365 And maybe we have to...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783 make it a bit more fancy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988 I don't know. Another way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404 نعم
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709 I suggest the single curve because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514 so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759 because it's a bit of an angle.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0197954_0198030 I think so.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198497_0198586 Now it's...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153 Do you have it upside down? That's top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581 So we get your advice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961 That's a good one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386 But I think it's better to put the screen on top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339 So I just flip it 180 degrees around.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592 If you can have this one and turn it like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761 Sit down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490 Because maybe your hand is in the way if you do this way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207860_0207900 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208151_0208188 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288 Start on the black, baby.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838 Curve.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509 here in this bag.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175 And then we can add a little bit of pulp here and here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421 Just that's for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958 and then the rest of the business.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498 Yeah, that's the...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344 Let me, let me, let me refresh the...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215951_0216031 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423 Thank you very much.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512 You got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081 So now for the next meeting, we'll have to look at the fuel design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575 It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819 check out the corpus website maybe.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286 The user interface design is the same, sorry.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527 and product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198 So the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771 but you're going to get your instructions I think sent by the coach.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642 I will put these minutes in the folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0221860_0223007 And then we're going to try to finish our project and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394 Me too, though. Let's see.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233 I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or... I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361 And then you'll get a message.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778 So let's just be it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026 Maybe this one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240 Okay, say it please, Mami.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225592_0225685 for this group.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653 All right, let's see here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788 Smart boy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235 So if you want to have a look at it, it's over there in the projects folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764 And then I guess we'll start in 30 minutes again.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227926_0228011 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943 MBC 뉴스 김수진입니다.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237 some research about the design of intervals.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969 Last meeting area about using a few buttons.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534 So that's what I want to.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088 through our design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675 So, finding an attractive way to control the remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406 I found something about speech recognition.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725 So maybe we can use that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241 Yeah, and using a little display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263 Just to focus on the primary functions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0052279_0053386 So only a bit for sound, for on off, shifting up a channel or down a shifting down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0054053_0055076 We hebben een aantal nieuwe attractieve functies nodig die mensen voor het gebruiken van de app attractievervangen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904 Ik hou van spreeksreconisatie en een speciale knop om de titels te selecteren.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247 Just as he mentioned last meeting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736 And yeah, now for all yours frankly
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079 Dus met grote knoppen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127 Het is mogelijk een vrij goedkope systeem te maken voor spreeksreconisatie.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078 Je kunt denken aan, als je je remote-controle verliezen hebt, je kunt het een signaal geven.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315 So yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059355_0060394 and for shifting it up a channel or for putting out the sound or something
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972 you can just give a sign, say sound off or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248 And, uh, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666 television
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061979_0062017 Cheers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062017_0062107 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754 I was thinking about a special button for subtitles, just one button to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187 Met één druk op het knopje krijg je kleine zet tijdens.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204 Double push, double click, dus je krijgt grote subtitles.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965 Hoe kan de smalste subtype?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167 So, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977 We moeten de general patterns blijven, dus we moeten de patterns gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608 de on-off, sound on-off, sound higher, lower en de numbers zero to nine.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499 The general button, more general, one button for shifting up and shifting down the jam.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0067499_0068547 We willen ook een kleine display gebruiken om de functies van de pattens te laten zien.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546 En we kunnen een functie bouwen die de televisie aanbiedt.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161 So, little picture of a.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824 Just put a 1.5mm bit over here in this corner.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571 Bijna alle afstandsbedieningen gebruiken de afstandsbediening op de plaats waar je op staat.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271 Dus mensen die de buitenlijn herkennen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416 So.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043 een display, of wat is het, een klein display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312 again put it on top
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615 Mae'r cyfan yn y ffordd mwyaf cyffredin.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199 De plek waar de mensen het meest vaak op kijken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041 And a special button for shifting up and down a channel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585 Om te lezen de taal maar of de...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038 So you can easily shift up or shift down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404 Two, greater than, greater than.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077560_0077623 and you play.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316 En een aantal functies voor de subtitelen, voor geluid.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304 Het overige ontwerp moeten we over praten.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573 And that's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0103973_0104066 What's the function?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374 Ja, om de batterijen op te laden.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104502_0104541 that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864 Oké, maar ik zal niet veel energie gebruiken, denk ik.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811 Het is een klein display, dus ik denk dat het op één batterij zal dragen voor zes maanden of meer.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293 So I believe one battery is just enough.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0107293_0107332 So.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0109111_0109182 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0122010_0123074 Maar dat is wat we kunnen kopen, een groot LCD-display of een kleine die we willen gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497 Is het mogelijk om een veranderingsgeval te maken?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140497_0141783 Met mobiele telefoons, zoals de Nokia, kun je de kast van de smartphone veranderen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143 Maybe it's possible possibility.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0142143_0143382 Je hebt alleen maar één standaard remote control en je kunt een paar...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139 We kunnen gewoon de regulaire vorm van het gebruiken, maar dat is niet zo'n fijn gevoel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0162139_0162213 Ciao.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324 for left-handed users.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165576_0165671 Yeah, wait.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715 Het is mogelijk om het programma te programmeren zodat je het op de linker of rechterkant kunt schakelen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669 En aan beide kanten schakelen voor de geluid.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929 Um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0168784_0168851 I love you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0171079_0171166 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825 of je moet een linker schoenen maken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980 You mean, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0174074_0174165 Yeah, you...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0181030_0181088 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486 Just using a thumb.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832 Yeah, really good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195579_0195663 This is a test.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040 You say it's, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266 I got like a stuff around me. Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849 So you want to put the display over here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945 no it's upside down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055 Yes, sir.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194 Let's do it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199194_0199283 Okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043 Maybe it's possible to make this side like...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428 I
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425 to make this slide.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850 Welcome.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217 a bit like so in the form of your hand
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202217_0202304 So, uh...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202446_0202545 Uh, it's...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157 So the remote control I have to lay in your hand.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536 So it's possible.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151 and the buttons for
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620 Changing the channel over here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644 So just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150 And then this plate.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061 Like on your mobile phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875 attachments.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463 But on off-bet, still only top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0002409_0002464 Yes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300 Iawn, dwi'n mynd i ddechrau.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995 I'm going to inform you about the Trump-watching activity over the past few days.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224 We've done some market research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610 We're distributing some more of Kent's questionnaires.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021670_0022728 And besides that, I deployed some train coaches to Milan and Paris to get all of the news trends.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525 I've consulted some additional trend watchers about what the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088 the best design would be.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509 Okay, these are some overall findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960 The most important thing is the fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462 The research indicated that that was by far the most important factor.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239 Innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776 By ineluctiveness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839 About half as important as the innovativeness was easy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0027839_0029193 For our group, we're focusing on the people 60-80 years old. These factors are slightly more equal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830 These are some more group specific finals.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102 The older people preferred dark colors.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533 They like recognizable shapes and familiar material.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093 Our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the most common type of
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633 material for older people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031633_0032764 This image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that a remote should have.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520 This leads us to some personal preferences.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933 The remote control and docking station should blend in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226 In the room.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797 Felly byddai hyn yn dylunio'r dylunio'n ddiddorol.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557 just keep it simple and well the docking station on the small screen would be your main points of interest
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270 because this would be the innovativeness in remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896 So this would be very important that we at least include these features.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036896_0037901 Well, the transport chairs, I consulted, advised that it should be remote control and the docking station should be telephone shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470 So you could imagine that the remote control would be standing up straight in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085 This is pretty much a new shape to older people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958 Also, they would prefer a design where the remote controller just lies flat in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170 So it would be kind of more telephone shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0040266_0041314 Besides that we would advise to bring two editions, one with a wood like color and maybe a few, and one with a grey black color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809 would like for the more exclusive people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998 people with more money.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227 A great black color for... well...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730 People with less means.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203 there would be more.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043635_0043711 the trace.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370 and how exactly does the kinetic energy work.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100370_0100424 You just.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747 your remote and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706 Well, personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499 and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267 And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559 get great popularity for our product.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007 What's
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196 Yeah, you could load up batteries, you could insert the... find the lost remote control function in there.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720 It's true. Elderly people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954 I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557 Because in our earlier market research, if you would allow me to. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235 Oh, sure. Sure.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594 We also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369 if people would pay more for speed recognition and remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827 But you can see here, our target group would not do that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229 So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667 Byddwn yn ymdrechu'n fawr iawn i'w wneud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175 I think it would be better to insert another product that is meant for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0118321_0118391 number of people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924 Well this is, yeah, but this is, here the question was would you prefer it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250 So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970 And on top of that, the LCD screen would help in making the remote control easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773 And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744 Well, this was for like an LCD screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971 So pretty large.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803 I think the most important factor there is the wooden color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136 So it would actually have to be, yeah, it's just.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0138485_0138558 Food color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574 you get a great experience.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670 We would have to look carefully into the design though.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517 because we would have to make one more control which would fit in with a wooden cover and
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798 plastic cover.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153 Yeah, our original one. Our standard one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184 Yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094 Well, no, I think we should just, we should then just design one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867 One remote, but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305 So, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151 I heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curve. Yes. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312 Could you explain that a little more?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954 and look with single curve and double curve mean
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539 So I can pretty much just do whatever I want.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156788_0156823 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967 No, just to lay down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229 cover
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889 Bu harbi şahesi
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200 You said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you could...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156 I think that's a very good point because I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause RSI.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342 So it would be great for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900 I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355 For left-handed users also.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860 um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985 Well, look.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721 Yeah, we could do that, but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the ease of use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0169396_0170527 But if we would make changing channels and changing volume buttons on both sides, it would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940 Because it could be made all symmetrical and stuff.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0171552_0171617 That is true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0183930_0184002 That's true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919 I prefer the cornice to be rounded.

AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318 So this is what me and Richard came up with.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630 The default spot for the on off button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914 The mute button just to love that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143 Then there's the volume and channel selectors.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651 Same form, plus minus button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832 We fall off a help button.

AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006 Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210 button for teletext
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412 button for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547 and the company logo.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108 So it's a rather simple prototype.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509 We will have to see from testing how the user is thinking.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603 Sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312 most controls they've got more buttons than this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651 And well, the on-off button, it's a necessity.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827 Again, drop that one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305 Volume and channel buttons you obviously need to turn off.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014 The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295 Felly, gallwn ni gasglu'r un hwn.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198 I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796 So, here it comes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107 Leave out the number buttons, I guess.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775 It's rather basic already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707 Yeah, there is a lot of other things.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038707_0039817 They're supposed to be equal sized. Try just to recognize.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922 That's what I'm looking for.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860 So for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160 We have a different color than the case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326 So they jumped out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672 Okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531 I think it's because...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589 If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402 which isn't the docking station isn't even in this schematic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799 No, it's not even taken into the price.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439 You could save money on it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909 But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432 My mother can't even send an SMS message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716 the margin of the future.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859 Any other
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608 You can just not scroll for half a second.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915 Dat is waar, ik zie het verschil laten worden.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041 If you want to use an LCD screen, you need an advanced chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942 If you click just, leave out one more button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104845_0104933 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706 Wat als je naar pagina 88 moet schrijven?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015 888.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125 You could make two buttons out of that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299 and just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820 If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160 So that would save two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291 if you do the same for the channel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0125541_0125614 More outfits.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0127499_0127588 Shall I create a trail?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190 If we leave out all those buttons perhaps we can go with the flat case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350 and make it smaller overall.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493 So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button, the screen right under that, then the scroll button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801 You get a much smaller remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131028_0131056 And we'll see you next time.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171 Richard's argument was.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0173211_0173289 B-105.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147 I'm sorry.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014 Ich finde, da zufrieden.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412 I think it's too fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585 to flesh it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806 Is this like after this are we done?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0199991_0200038 That's true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434 Yeah, true finance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207148_0207215 Yeah, this wasn't good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687 The tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step. It's very easy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414 The smartboard, the drawing is just a pain in the ass.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773 It didn't prepare us very well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110 flip over or more precise.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0214261_0214361 in this building.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0217626_0217690 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023 considering we are not going to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0002698_0002756 No problem.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551 Спасибо.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665 It's 33 o'clock.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450 Our fourth and last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004774_0004870 There he is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801 Okay, this is our last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236 In this meeting we will discuss our final design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073 And we will do some evaluation about not only the product but also the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473 And then we're going to close the project today as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027 So after that you'll be a free girl and spend all your money.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951 This is a detailed design meeting. We will discuss the look and feel of the design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616 the usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053 In order to go to this agenda.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431 We will have the prototype presentation first.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847 Then we will set up some evaluation criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128 Then we will look at the finance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851 We would love to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264 Everything costs money and the more things you should want to have, the more money it will cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897 So we'll see if it fits within the 12.5 euro per month.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106 You will see that later.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608 That will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797 We've got 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313 So, we will be finished at half past three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458 But first...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059 We will do the prototype presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536 Some attributes for it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033 I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364 Just a few burdens and large burdens.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914 But I think these are all together quite a few buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558 I'm wondering if we really need all of those rhythms.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0030283_0030338 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0034073_0034143 Right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567 I think they should tie those up.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300 Somebody but something about the design of the buttons there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042770_0042859 Bitsin abi.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583 I think there's only 30 minutes left. I will move on to the finance part.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103 which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible whatever we want to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313 And I can tell you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184 We're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12 and a half years.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093 if you see, I don't know if I filled in correctly so just correct me if you see something wrong
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275 I got two batteries.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449 But maybe we can also use one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046688_0046778 It's Richard.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046778_0046829 There we go.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569 It's still your result.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771 Asansörü kullanıyoruz.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964 在这儿找到趣味了
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445 Save there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674 Here we have the single curve.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330 We can see that the difference between n curves and single curves is 1 euro.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0049567_0050630 I don't know, but I think the single curve is good for design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771 I think we have to keep it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207 Then we have the case material supplements.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051207_0051288 It's plastic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551 It's the cheapest one we need.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892 So that's not much to unsave either.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253 But then the biggest cause are the patents.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124 so maybe the ringer should try to discard some buttons to keep our cost low
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846 Because we were asked to get 12.5 euros at the end.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498 So, let's first count the buttons we have now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741 16.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171 a little bit in the water
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282 Nathan DeRose
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363 Okay, including the help.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973 I think we can discard the help and the mute button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577 by pressing down volume or pressing down a number.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157 That saves us one year already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347 Dat is daar nu ook al het verhieven in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058911_0059003 And this is...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638 نعم، هذا شغال
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761 Yeah, but it's not stated in this. It's just a...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582 So maybe we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189 That's possibly a job.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747 So and it's good for the design as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063747_0063844 that you could make.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253 Uh, let's see.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373 I should make this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283 Please stay right there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604 Cross.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938 So
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067938_0067994 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755 I think they can't material
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069640_0069710 Uh...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069710_0069759 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476 But I think because we have the advanced chip, we can just count this as one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612 No, we're not.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110 Maybe he lives with them. It seems to me that it's impossible to live with 12 and a half euros.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807 Also the LCD display, I think it's too expensive for the display we use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166 I think they tried.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535 That's right, but what's the biggest advantage of our remote then?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858 Take it into the prize.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075858_0075946 That's extra.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075946_0075992 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577 That's an option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108 그런 식으로
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625 Don't you think we can, if we can, go this as one button?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335 and integrate these buttons in three. Then save a lot of money as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0079648_0079729 It's cool.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216 Yeah, but we have to stick with the 12 and all of you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758 We don't have any more budget.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085451_0085521 Cheers.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913 If you repeat what the CCD is playing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188 And if you use less buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824 But I can't use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445 Yeah, sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876 beginning.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0088391_0088466 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850 dwi'n credu ei fod yn anodd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606 Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program users.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091774_0091815 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155 That's not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082 I'm going to turn away from the storms.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454 Not.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956 Or maybe you can...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416 Scroll.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856 If you scroll you will see the numbers on the LCD display.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061 until you've got the right number, then you push it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800 Kuşların ıskıldığı olmuş.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289 Okay, then you can push some other buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097773_0097811 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288 you can scroll to a number and then you wait a half second and then it turns to the channel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412 Ja, det skulle definitivt bli en klockast.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634 and
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440 and the regular chip is not possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541 Has to be at 12.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028 You need an advanced chip, you know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674 Now we can save a euro by a flip design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510 That's an option you can... Then we're almost there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103221_0103313 So if he...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097 Yeah, but I think that is a big advantage.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780 Can we integrate the data text and the subtitles in one button?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181 I think it's pretty much...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035 That could be.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0110185_0111458 I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738 Just make it real simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275 Because it saves a lot of money.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622 And we can keep our LCD screen, which can provide extra information.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798 how to use the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097 I'll have to use the algebraic inventions as subtitles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870 En het is ook goed voor het innovatieve design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054 Give me the rice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936 And that's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970 It's a bit off maybe.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0118202_0118283 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389 Something like that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119627_0119725 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301 one, two, three, four, five levels if we erase this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659 I'm using two of those on the side.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704 That's really a good idea. Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742 And it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440 So we make one volume, one division.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540 So shall I finish?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127540_0127616 It's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873 So we've got 1, 2, 3.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246 Yeah, we can leave the teletext in if we want.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484 Dat is een zout schaar.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0129528_0129580 So if you put.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130183_0130236 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130848_0130903 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131141_0131200 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599 decrease this value too.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0132777_0132865 You only have to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891 It's more the models in which they are being made, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149 Single currents is really easy to just fill in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440 and the case has come right out of the machine.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932 I'm just going to be shading in the flat part.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349 Rwy'n credu mai hwn yn un llawn iawn.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204 What does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368 Great.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976 I just have to...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138075_0138134 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138448_0138544 I'll get it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061 and we do some work in research.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867 But I think we can keep the single car from it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423 just to express our LCD screen a bit more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234 Some people use it more, especially for the help functions. It will be good if we add scroll bar, scroll button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583 It will be necessary if you have a good canal function as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553 So.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030 I think it was better to have this price list a bit early.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412 Yes, go ahead.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852 I think that's a good thing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487 That's pretty different.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0146301_0146358 to get
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692 So we're gonna...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147824_0147921 I think the most.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713 chasing a chinsaw.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057 You can maybe stick it out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709 Maybe that's recognizable for them as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882 It's a good one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380 So, I'm afraid there's no more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789 And it's less frightening, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461 If they see this design, they'll think, oh, there are only five buildings.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0151710_0151804 It's gonna be like what?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752 I would buy it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952 謝謝
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182 I would buy a new balance sheet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385 Right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583 Articus and the Fountain of Heroes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939 Yes, they are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590 Then we can go with the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185 Okay, sit down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519 We still have 15 minutes left so nice and scheduled.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017 The project process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654 Evaluation of the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0156703 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972 That was the thingy, the point I forgot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157073_0157148 Shit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416 Yeah, right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406 We've got five minutes I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595 No, we've got 15 minutes, but no.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0159654_0159733 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0160899_0160939 Cool.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947 Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409 I try to but it's giving errors.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151 I think it's fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912 Subtitles, but it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763 So I've got 20 cents for our docking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172007_0172054 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577 It's a bit dodgy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279 I would say for the war fighters.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431 405.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173431_0173528 Diolch yn fawr.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0174139_0174236 It's functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410 I think it's seven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373 Nyt vuorosuhteet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514 I have been worked out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276 They are ugly, not very functional and getting lost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496 I think with our new radio button, I think it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180601_0180679 I think it's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0181167_0181228 stand.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495 that we give this for.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543 Then we have to do it in three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656 Stay with me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657 and they want to put fashion in their products.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820 in the slogan of the company.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250 We have the removable front cases.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526 So I think it's very recognizable.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302 We've got a community.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159 Rydyn ni'n mynd i'r ysgolion.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159 That kind of thing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0191694_0191750 What do you want?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723 I'm going 80%

AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734 That's 84%.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531 I think it's a pretty nice school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196264_0196309 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091 that brings us to the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969 프로젝트 프로세스
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284 Did we move through the right places, you think?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0198284_0198384 long process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199215_0199260 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792 So lack of information about prices.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462 What's the room for creativity?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171 Because of the finance shit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519 They're roomless.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092 Internet access.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292 It wasn't clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819 Did it work out?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206819_0206916 Working together.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281 Also you to review with the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665 were the means sufficient for the tasks that we had to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854 Why are they too much?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210536_0210617 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227 if it wants to download its data.

AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719 Smart boards was irritating.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663 So you rather want to have a flip over.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862 or some flip that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403 false tennis belt.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214952_0215006 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117 You need a smart port application I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463 I think it's very important.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606 That should be equal to seven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760 Yeah, you can export it as an image.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036 Yeah, it must be.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673 So the sharing of information was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973 management's work.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141 Yeah, I've been itching around the table.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0221553_0221616 it's possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383 We found new ideas for...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719 having this kind of meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853 So everybody puts his own score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438 Yeah, it mediates the score and you can get more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629 That's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773 So it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226902_0226980 Very good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875 Any more ideas?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035 or questions about the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187 about the product.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027 Good, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842 And as we get to our last sheet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225 article is in the video.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759 Considering we are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184 station
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323 That's a good boy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942 But maybe because of the docking station, the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459 I think you can compensate that as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053 So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536 Do we think we're going to get the 12.5 million?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728 How old was he? 15.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002 Cresyn, Cresyn iodd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226 I think you will.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421 Are you going to exploit this product?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631 Yeah, innovative.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796 Appreciate it, America.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996 People are really thinking it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923 More for the younger people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789 Just put it on the mic for everybody.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421 You can change markets by changing the front cover.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648 That's one thing you can change it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492 So you can also try to reach the other people by putting fancy covers on the mark.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596 Just as a test.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780 See the eye birds?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960 That's I think a good thought.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889 I think we can have our little celebration.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243008_0243104 That's it. Party, party.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641 I think we still have to tell him one more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243641_0243727 I see.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243727_0243778 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907 I didn't get a message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644 from the ending of the video.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766 5 dakika.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244766_0244857 That's good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441 Then we still have some questions.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777 If somebody has some questions, they can ask them now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188 We can put this in the project folder as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0246188_0246256 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137 Next four words. Picture nothing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996 This is another.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380 So you see the project forward.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0251380_0251450 I do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252084_0252182 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073 I think I'm going to make our final presentation now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994 I will be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292 summary of the project
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455 I think you have a question here. In your room?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867 And then I'll meet you in, I think, like, 10 minutes. OK.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257911_0257969 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676 Hopefully my pen will download its software.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258798_0258869 for
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520 Dat zijn gewoon de normale remote controles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092 Je stelt het op en je komt op pagina 100.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492 Je kunt de normale 1-0 knoppen gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251 Je kunt ook de knop van de kanaal veranderen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597 So the shifting better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145 om de tekst op te schakelen en de tekst naar beneden te schakelen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0028020_0028081 Yeah, just a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0032664_0032723 Certainly.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076 Of je kunt het bouwen als je een knopje drukt.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430 We just discussed that already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841 but we think all people don't know that option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336 so I just put it in the bedding.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0036106_0036142 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0038595_0038650 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039621_0039712 Triangle.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870 Just to recognize it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252 And we don't need LEDs or...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216 We hebben ook een remote control, maar omdat we een kleine display gebruiken, moeten we het niet gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989 这可以就行
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640 Go there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055647_0055737 Fifteen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074 Yeah, we do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059797_0059890 I think there are two.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170 It's just one better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336 of it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809 So, to one big burn.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278 but they are more expensive than the small ones.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447 I
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922 Just a reference.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814 But I don't know if it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508 So, we still got four buttons but just...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393 you got another bit better than itself but on the chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825 you've got still for that's right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0070187_0070270 Yeah, but you can change it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323 We can apply a remote control when you can use it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080323_0080403 So.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080795_0081905 Je moet onder de 1250 blijven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675 This is the best tool.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308 But it is possible to make one for 1250.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0085405_0085486 I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769 but I can't use switch.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698 Do you want to make a...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326 Ja.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709 Wait a minute though.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083 attractive options
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571 Dus je kunt onder de 1250 blijven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862 Let's go to this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091964_0092017 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0102171_0102209 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643 Or you have to skip the subtitle button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896 I think that's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203 Yeah, it's a big trenches.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445 But, um, it's.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104854_0104924 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420 Maar als je dat doet, dan is het wel goed.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106593_0106649 to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180 That could be a few bits.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0130811_0130845 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737 Je kunt een groot remandontrol maken voor dezelfde prijs als een klein remandontrol.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154 You only have to pay for the double curved or single curved
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0144166_0144215 MBC 뉴스 김재경입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881 Oh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245 Maar ze weten de scrollknoppen van oude radio's niet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690 Also buttons like that for changing the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848 So maybe it's a.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341 That's very special.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0169428_0169515 You'll go to sleep.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172293_0172354 Do it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113 I would say
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379 405.

AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045 There's a lot of people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054 That's a free.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961 We have to test it a bit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151 Yeah, true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0183216_0183313 I think I've got three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0184600_0184659 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0198655_0198706 Take a shower.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034 or a more precise.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998 Als je wilt delen als je een foto maakt zoals deze op de presentatie.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302 It's easier to share it with other people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688 Je kunt het opzetten en op je internet plaatsen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321 or in shared folder or shared directory.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617 It's like in my laptop, but no.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571 Het kan ook een export worden.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221557_0221619 it's possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0222830_0223899 Yeah, maybe just give the numbers of
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0224017_0225098 Het is makkelijker om dingen op de computer te doen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564 University
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0232341_0232375 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0243410_0243496 Esse chegou aí.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498 La bléfuelle.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875 Maybe a day will save you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252875_0252954 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986 Maybe you have to fill another questionnaire.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256986_0257044 just here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765 Sorry, I'm going to go to bed.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891 I think it's stuck in the traffic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337 So, is this the moment where we ask, where can I ask questions about the functionality?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526 When you're in Teletext, there usually are buttons where you just press it and you go to the next Teletext page.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009 functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127 That's what I pointed out earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580 Als je gewoon een tv-controle maakt, is er niet veel te winnen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624 since it's rechargeable.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058664_0058737 It's this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435 I assume you count the volume and channel things for two buttons each, right?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016 I don't think I did or two of those.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891 I was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402 That would cut the cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849 I think this review is for Republicans anyhow.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689 on the docking station of this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247 Then we should move to a different spot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213 e
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340 Well, since the market research.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439 indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easily. Maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715 especially since we have those nice features.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761 If you repeat after, since you need to play.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089659_0089691 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089831_0090913 Basically you have a choice between a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017 But how would a scroll wheel work here?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447 That would bring up the price of the school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836 i
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096836_0096923 Put that in you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523 I think that would be like the end of her usability.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0099189_0099267 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892 I think it's pretty much, the teletext subtitles are, right now you just push the teletext button, go to page 888, and the teletext disappears.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058 But the subtitles stay there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387 That's a good one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498 Scroll to A, click, scroll to A, click, scroll to A, click.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376 But then again, that would be just pretty much not an option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108535_0108604 Holding it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349 a remote which they expect to have like 10 buttons for the numbers 1 to 0.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761 with only five buttons on it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109976_0110054 And it's cold.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143 It's a pretty big school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621 So this is fun.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884 I know you for better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803 Well, I still think we should go for the single curve design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008 But then again, I'm.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451 All these changes are not really OK with me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601 but since
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137769_0137865 I just have to know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255 I don't know, just go to the board and...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782 Get us $10, $18, yeah. Yeah, for a month.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228 We'll do some more research and see what the options are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362 Screen it up for me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959 this is not really like for the group you were making
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152 This will really require a lot of marketing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482 to get this to sell.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297 Other people like familiar forms and familiar stuff.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426 This is not familiar.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830 So we're going to have to do a lot of convincing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151389_0151436 Das ist schon so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580 Might be confusing to you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151720_0151805 What?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906 Only five buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944 But you're not 60.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394 So I like to set up all these criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642 Evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339 I'll go with this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865 Okay, so I did some literature study, analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347 translated into criteria, which would be these.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584 This is Remote Fantasy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756 y ffordd mae'r ffordd yn edrych arnoch chi.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137 What new functions are there?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162137_0162232 Easy to use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741 Learnability is a very important factor here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952 It's functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317 Are there not too many functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740 and those functions are they useful?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163740_0163825 The cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164080_0164162 Target group.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617 This remote reading from the group we're making it for.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998 and wake up mobility.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536 If our company is easily recognizable, they're a company rating.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081 So we're supposed to evaluate it right now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166423_0166471 See you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260 I have to say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0167371_0167425 We're not paying attention.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001 is the design of Fancy on a scale of one to seven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635 about the semantics.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392 Um, guess if these are innovative.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929 Subtitles, that is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181 It's the design easy to use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172780_0172879 would be for us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0173579_0173666 I'd go for 14.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438 is the design functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714 Do we have all functions that we want to include?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174849_0174943 I think we do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151 Do we have too many functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175151_0175235 I'm not a teacher.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175235_0175320 Конечно.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990 Dhalindui.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676 take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833 like it getting lost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301 It was.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0177301_0177351 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770 Production cost from having the preset limits.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178770_0178849 You want to lay right here?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698 Doesn't design fit the group of focus.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180138_0180230 Think without a view.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180815_0180879 It's
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181091_0181152 I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034 I think the radio button is not exactly what older people expect of a remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0182989_0183036 I'm not sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172 I'm going to go to the kitchen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632 Is it coffee? Coffee like an ice cream? Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762 I was also supposed to calculate the score but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353 We have another project. We've got to clean after this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785 Is this, like, after this are we done?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100 I'm going to be grunting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189254_0189335 Well, I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567 These are several factors from the 7s.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356 Малыш, мам.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964 I'm just doing...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191089_0191157 I'm not sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499 So maybe my mistake.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834 41.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134 I guess I'll just type what I'm doing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171 So that would be a good option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145 I think we should have had the finance thingy in the hall earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442 In de design phase.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0201763_0201840 Not too much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202278_0202335 Yeah, true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157 and I would have liked to go for the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420 younger users also.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833 and just to be able to access the internet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0204002_0204098 Get something to eat.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573 Rwy'n ceisio gweld y ffinal ar fy nghyfforddiad.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217671_0217762 좋나?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219000_0219096 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219812_0219863 That was me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0232490_0232532 They are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767 15. Cresi.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237264_0237626 Yeah, I still don't think... I mean if we're gonna make a scroll button anyway.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244 It would be more for the younger people than for the older people. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405 So maybe we should just refocus.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004 specifically for different people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0239502_0239563 Let's change it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758 I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is with older people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0241921_0241996 for the people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325 Even if it were their covers.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121 That's it. Party, party.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0244479_0244521 Yeah, you do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0253017_0253106 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515 I thought you were supposed to like...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688 Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0259069_0259156 Thank you guys.
