AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0001232_0001522 so show me what you need and we will talk about it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003404_0003804 there you go
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003804_0004372 ooh i dropped mine as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0004372_0004550 it is awesome that it goes down
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0014258_0014411 so that you can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0015240_0015280 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0019299_0019342 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0020774_0021798 i guess a button makes a bit more sense because otherwise you do not really know that oh what if i right click now what happens then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0021798_0022021 well no you still have the mint
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0022494_0022568 it is morning
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0023119_0023309 but well like if you want to add more things
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0028511_0029029 i guess it is like part of the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029176_0029382 browsing sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029382_0029782 more than the speaker characterization as steve mentioned
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029782_0030242 yeah it is true it would be nice to have it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033387_0033423 i
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033648_0034102 i mean i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034102_0034749 well if you get to speak a croatian that someone talks a lot in a certain topic
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034749_0035495 and then if you click on that topic you get everything that is in that topic
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035495_0035633 i mean that is still in our
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035885_0035950 i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0047186_0047257 like we have to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048370_0048684 like shoulder speaker characteristics
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048684_0048784 then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0049626_0050203 but if you do double click on something do not you expect something to happen
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0050347_0050518 surtout à fidèle
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0052255_0052654 yeah to do something but it is a good story
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0053716_0053759 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054234_0054469 i am guessing a point some d
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054629_0054823 yeah watch her clicking on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0056192_0056252 single channel
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0064834_0065636 but well currently i mean you probably i do not know if you want to have like the full transcription and the summary at the same time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0065756_0066343 so maybe you can just choose the same window for transcription and summary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066792_0066942 cat is eyes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066942_0067089 yeah good zimmer style
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067488_0067598 did we
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067598_0067821 can you do that in time i do not think so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069530_0069723 or just i do not know but yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069723_0070329 yeah that might be just contents of the same window yeah yeah transcription to summary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0070453_0070496 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071598_0071661 lot of different ways
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071661_0071729 we can do it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071903_0072556 no no it could be like transcription yeah or check
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0073967_0074082 i do not like it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0075387_0075484 i thought i especially
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0077778_0077821 to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079078_0079370 yeah well i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079370_0079997 with transcripts sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alphabets
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079997_0080387 like full meeting meeting without disabilities and summer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0081037_0081143 bye
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084663_0084719 i guess it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084719_0085603 i mean just to try and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing yeah that is what we need
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086073_0086473 just so see the integration works sort of between the income
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086888_0087101 so i guess that is what we need to move on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088004_0088628 well i guess i mean that was probably our intention but we might not have written it down
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088628_0088867 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0094981_0095082 let us do that again
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0097561_0097613 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099449_0099697 i can tell you what i am an sbt
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099998_0100130 so um i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0100130_0101160 i basically started browsing a bit just like trying to see if there is anything out there to use
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101288_0101585 i will be searching for pictures
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101585_0101685 it already files though
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101685_0101792 gang max
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101792_0102458 okay found a tutorial about inverted search indexing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103281_0103473 yeah well i do not know if it is usable
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103473_0103608 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103608_0104072 but i found some code from a tutorial about indexing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104072_0104133 cool
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104458_0104529 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0105467_0105681 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106017_0106053 i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106053_0106854 i was a bit worried about when he talked about this with the file i do not know what files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106854_0107249 i mean how much do we actually need to do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0107249_0107771 like extracting things from the xml files and stuff to be able to do the indexing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110119_0110483 are you writing in java yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110616_0110841 i mean you should look at have a look at
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0113394_0114347 um yeah i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with fowl things
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0114347_0114848 i mean if you already started we can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115519_0115636 should we i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115829_0115980 meet up and see what we can do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115980_0116747 i mean i do not know see what you have done and see what we need what we know more
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0116747_0116842 sweet
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0121416_0121534 that started
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0122521_0122604 which should be possible
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128171_0128615 but is it like a window where you have to write a search query
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128615_0128800 or is it just what is behind it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128800_0129035 no this is not the actual
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0129035_0129151 such
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0134560_0135831 when you like is there a open thingy or what did you do to like how did you figure out that this uses mixed seed search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144448_0144493 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144867_0144899 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0149397_0149437 no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0152324_0152410 which
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0155807_0156044 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0156411_0156771 i am happy to have awakened this cortisol

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0163914_0163954 i think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166080_0166148 dooms
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166778_0167381 the progress report is june twenty third

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0173910_0174620 nicely done though is not it yeah it is quite impressive is not it it is actually all these things that are next to each other
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175509_0175587 hmm
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175691_0175770 i know

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0180527_0180987 so we do not have to do all the work again just figuring out stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0181391_0181684 just like accessing the corpus and stuff

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200596_0201020 we have one class at least when we do speech perception we do not have any lectures
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201020_0201252 but i think we are having like a lot of classes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201252_0201545 i do not think there was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202017_0202078 zcorner
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202348_0202617 it was all really bad
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202617_0203004 i think the other verges had
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204224_0204578 yeah we will probably have it out now
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204578_0204860 last week okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205048_0205523 yeah um i guess that is it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205523_0205676 was there anything else
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205676_0206048 do anyone wanna like take care of this or should i take care of it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206263_0206578 i do not know i feel something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206578_0206731 i think it basically said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206959_0207489 the same things as in the comments if i could mute it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0207601_0208075 you want to be in the video

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210783_0210862 i would say
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210996_0211532 that person
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211532_0211708 it is pretty good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211708_0211786 i am gonna get eaten
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211914_0212391 you are okay with having me
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213391_0213503 for a thumbnail
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213503_0213747 what
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213928_0214081 is she still here
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0214081_0214159 yes you are
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0000358_0000538 cheap piece of shit
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001320_0001372 çövenin içi
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001521_0002417 shall we just go around and everyone says what they have been doing has anybody done anything no one
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0002417_0002522 hi i am a snake
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003057_0003385 well i have got a brother now luís whoops
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003385_0003440 there you go
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005038_0005142 so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005142_0005935 we have got a browser which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005935_0006681 and then when you go on the menu you can select the summarisation box which pops up and an audio player
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0006879_0007304 and i think the search works as well so you can pop up a search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007304_0007975 and it loads up just the background window so empty and so when you start
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007975_0008475 you have to either open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008648_0008707 that makes sense
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008861_0009603 the transcription box has got a summarize button which does not do anything yet
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0009603_0010391 now i wonder how we want to do you know we want to pop up window with the speaker characterization
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010620_0010958 either we could do that you know when does a pop up come
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010958_0011582 either we can when you click on the id any sort of id in the transcription box
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0011582_0012313 or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarize button so that you actually in the transcription box
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012838 so you click on a button and then the ear options whatever that speaker characterisation is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012838_0013481 the problem is the left click is already used because it highlights that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0013662_0014263 that part of speech or whatever that what he is saying the left click highlights it right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014263_0014755 so that you can i do not know what happens when you double click actually
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014755_0015291 but that would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015291_0015579 i think so yeah when you left click it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015579_0016074 you can for example set the marker there so that the audio goes from there i think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016268_0016434 so we can not put it on left again
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016434_0016638 we could put it on a right click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016638_0016875 we could for example have a little menu that pops up
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0017064_0017669 so right click on it menu you know and you can click on speed of characterization
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018003_0018170 that is a good point
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018170_0018296 hmm
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018296_0018364 otherwise
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018512_0019136 yeah yeah but i do not know about you but usually in windows right click does not do anything does it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019136_0019281 it opens a menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019281_0019509 ie dynar hyn rydyn nin ei wneud yna yn enwedig gyda fy
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019509_0019685 bit weird for it to just not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019685_0019789 bringing that stuff in there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0020464_0020661 or just you know or just the button
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0021828_0022161 well no you still have the menu pop up
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022303_0022415 well oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022415_0022683 it is more obvious is not it it is more idiotic is not it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022781_0022916 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022916_0023124 that is true yeah more intuitive
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0023440_0023676 it is never worse than any of the other things
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0024560_0025014 this one
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0025014_0026007 but actually what we could do is in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026135_0026438 like search for that user yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026438_0026635 is that going to be useful or too much
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0027270_0027918 yeah so when you right click on it one option will be give me all your meetings characterise the speaker
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0028408_0028527 or is that too much
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0029777_0029908 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030101_0030163 yeah it is true
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030163_0030404 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031661_0031855 when you mean the speaker characterization
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031855_0031976 oh well yeah i mean
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032138_0032239 i do not know about that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032239_0032507 i mean the speaker characterization is a bit like you said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032507_0032731 i mean it is like a nice thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032731_0033237 we do not we are not actually sure what the user wants with it but it is interesting so why not give it to him
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033408_0033513 i think we should do it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033513_0033555 mbc 뉴스 김지경입니다
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035475_0035713 yeah i mean that is still another level further
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035713_0035849 i mean we are not even there yet
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035849_0036132 no no no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036132_0036419 we have to first define what happens when you click on a user
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036933_0037201 so should we try to do a right click menu then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0038786_0039120 yeah there is a second thing about the topics the topic window
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039120_0039859 you want to somehow be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039955_0040278 so we could do that in a similar way do it right click as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040278_0040500 so this dot is for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040963_0041128 so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0041128_0042077 so we have basically two options of browsing the meetings is by either searching and opening individual observations
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0042077_0042413 and then we have the interlinking by right click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0043540_0043601 double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0046279_0046699 i do not see there is anything obvious that would be able
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0048635_0049016 but then there is a problem with a lot of windows popping up again
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0049016_0049385 and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050231_0050320 yeah man
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050661_0051319 stop coming up i am going to close it it is not the end of the world
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051319_0051763 yeah yeah i was just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051763_0052198 well i will check what it does on double click at the moment yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052198_0052354 because i think it would do something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052354_0053059 but i do not i really do not see anything obvious there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0053232_0053373 i mean if you can think of something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0054942_0055367 yeah another thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055367_0055554 single audio files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055554_0055657 do we want to use him or not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056175_0056388 yeah single channel files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056388_0056482 so we want them
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056482_0056539 amen
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056935_0057083 it is all right see you next week
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0057083_0057836 we might use them at the moment to work with them but do we want to integrate them so that when you browse you can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058138_0058175 do you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058175_0058529 he is not going to make much sense if you listen to it on its own do you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058529_0058566 less
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0059290_0059432 it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061004_0061410 yeah what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that you mentioned
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061410_0061622 do you think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061802_0062025 we need to have that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0062025_0062566 i mean i am very much i want to have everything customisable
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063100_0063186 tweedle do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063271_0063546 two or three maybe but yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063546_0063967 but yeah it depends i mean i really want to put the summary in somewhere you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063967_0064139 and the summary for example is typical
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064139_0064653 you open the window you read through it you might click on you know close it again straight away
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064653_0064783 baby guitars
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0066465_0066707 first one was five fifteen sixteen
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067015_0067093 sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr sehr
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067093_0067298 yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067298_0067356 that is right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067356_0067509 i am not sure yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067774_0067816 bye
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067816_0068028 maybe you probably can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068028_0068145 i am sure
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068145_0068259 i am sure you could do anything
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069193_0069280 i can have a look
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069694_0069876 but yeah that might be changed
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074042_0074793 i do not know if people get used to it i mean when you use a windows or linux for that matter you have a lot of windows open
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074793_0074870 see you soon
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075637_0075770 yeah you can minimize
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075770_0075825 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0076972_0077180 yeah that is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077312_0077525 yeah they are definitely going to be in the same way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077961_0078225 yeah that was the plan for the disparities anyway
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078225_0078273 so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078405_0078674 yeah do you want to do that with some reason
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078674_0078914 put the sorrows in the same way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0079024_0079145 mutually exclusive
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0080411_0080636 yeah do you want to do that that kind of makes sense yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0081658_0082025 and finally the prototype he spoke about
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082025_0082238 what kind of prototype could we produce
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082427_0082876 because i am just you know i go into the lab and i say what am i going to change today
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082876_0082966 no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082966_0083521 and it kind of just it just develops i am not aiming for anything
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0083521_0083648 do we want to answer something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084151_0084417 i am pretty much getting there anyway to be honest
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084417_0084676 it is not going to be a lot more work
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0086512_0086575 check
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0087635_0087724 alright
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090041_0090334 like if we are gonna just try and like take a look or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090334_0090526 i do not know can we access people
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091245_0091452 yeah sure
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091452_0091735 i do not know if it is readable at the moment but you can show them
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092632_0092884 right well i will make that readable then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092884_0093251 so the directory is my number
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093469_0093781 well this is not terrible what is your number
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093781_0093953 in all the emails yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093953_0094325 your number
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094325_0094677 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094852_0094906 sick time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095076_0095254 may fourth five thousand five hundred and fifty six
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095493_0095832 and then there is a full doc in lssd
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095954_0096182 and it is called the m browser
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0096372_0096633 lower your head
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097137_0097408 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097408_0097519 you have got fault sir
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097519_0097586 our love for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098653_0098772 yeah so that is me done
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098772_0098929 someone else want to talk about that stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101141_0101294 what were you doing again
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101518_0101603 that is so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103010_0103097 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103097_0103239 can you fancy some kyle flu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103796_0103892 of mobile
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0104071_0104139 cool cool
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105314_0105391 yeah that is handy
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105647_0105801 so you think it should not be too difficult
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107796_0107929 i always see
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107984_0108254 you have to convert it to some sort of formula
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0110673_0111508 i mean you should have a look at the browser code then because they already extract for example transcripts
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0111508_0111638 i am sure they do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117526_0117565 eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117565_0117771 this week is only two days old
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119772_0119940 that would be key probably
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119940_0120083 was not it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0120083_0120184 so cute
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122509_0122961 well the browser is i use it now or as
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122961_0124017 it was there when i took it it uses the nxt search to get the data out of the files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124017_0124283 which i think is odd but i am not quite sure how it works
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124283_0124371 and do not quote me on this stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124736_0125544 to get the data for example to get the summarisation data you have to search for the id is or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0126372_0126907 so they do not say look in that and that folder but they say search everything
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127599_0127915 it does fade out quite quick
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127915_0128090 it is not so mad
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128090_0128300 but what i said like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128916_0129092 no this is not the actual search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129092_0129792 this is just when you open you know to load the transcript for example to find the transcript for a certain meeting
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129792_0130668 it does an nxt search for the string i do not know transcript or text or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0131325_0132073 yeah so i do not know if you have looked at the search query language but it is like a dollar a text
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132517_0132635 and then yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132635_0133008 because every year all of these
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133146_0133367 these files have got an id
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133367_0133778 and all the transcript files got the string i do not know what it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133778_0134161 words or text or something in it so just search for those files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0135749_0136115 um is it um well it is in the code
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136115_0136646 just that you define a search object and then you search that string
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136646_0136971 i had to figure out how to do the same thing for the summary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136971_0137045 that is the way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137199_0137656 i had to understand how they did the transcript to do the song
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137932_0138302 yeah just search for specific strings
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0138539_0139209 so you could just you know you could use that when you if you want to take the data out
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0139668_0140326 if you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140326_0140557 you know whatever you want to do then just send me an email
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140684_0140767 i can explain
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141071_0141221 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141221_0141861 actually in the moment it is got a load of rubbish because the the the browsers that i used from this from you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141861_0142167 that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142167_0142569 and i have not dared to throw out all the functions i do not need
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142569_0142648 dumb shit
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142891_0143171 so they are all in there yet still
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143171_0143597 a lot of rubbish but it will be chucked down at the end i think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143975_0144143 yeah

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153288_0153740 yeah it is a nine nine equals ten or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153901_0154781 and then i am doing parallel programming languages and systems which we had one exercise as well and that is in friday
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155035_0155705 well i am not doing any backhanding so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155705_0155763 good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159233_0159403 yeah if you like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159403_0159664 well we can decide
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159741_0159994 so what are you planning to do over the weekend then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160140_0160327 you are gonna do the search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160327_0160522 good aim with the circle
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0163891_0164297 it is just that i think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164485_0164537 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164782_0164907 behind schedule
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0166146_0166411 well you decide i am not very much for that kind of thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0167893_0168151 well how about we get it done by then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168151_0168188 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168444_0168972 then we can write about it in the interim report now we have got something to show
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0170421_0170824 oh and the search interface
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171085_0171814 maybe you should decide pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171814_0172395 and then if you want you can give that to me and i will build you a nice few dick boxes and drop down menus
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173031_0173365 oh that is that is so that does not exist
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173365_0173753 that was completely cut and pasted
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173753_0173939 that does not exist
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173939_0174331 nicely done there is not it yeah that is quite impressive is not it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0174331_0175377 because actually all these things are nicked from you know all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from google
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175377_0175487 screenshot of google
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175679_0176358 i know i remember that is got so much more
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176358_0176565 it is gonna be a little difficult more difficult
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176565_0177317 yeah i mean i was going to but you know the whole drop down menus and stuff what we want to search for is not quite agreed on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177317_0177653 we never agreed on what we were going to be able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177980_0178441 yeah do you want to just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0178441_0178929 and then we could discuss at next meeting which options we really want to include
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0179135_0179603 i would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0181211_0181306 no already what
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183053_0183130 yeah sort of

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0023928_0024337 well i guess in meeting browser one point one
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0024337_0025195 you can have a menu instead of a bathroom but actually what we could do is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0026762_0026807 i guess
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0026807_0027289 so what did you part of the menu that comes down is says give me all your meetings yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028606_0028670 i guess so

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0056580_0057088 probably not but we might need them for disfluences if we decided to do it in audio
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057088_0057255 we might use them at the moment no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057255_0057500 to work with them but do we want it into
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057791_0058099 he might want to be able to say oh just give me what that person is saying
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058505_0058736 unless you can not hear it properly or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058736_0058939 somebody is talking over somebody else
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058939_0058979 you

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067517_0067620 did we not have the data
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067620_0067699 you do that too
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067699_0067902 i do not think tom and i have got to do that bernie
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067902_0068026 maybe you probably can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068026_0068178 sure fair
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068294_0068404 i think he really knew what he was doing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068404_0068460 mbc 뉴스 김재경입니다
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068460_0068785 it is a bit of a cripple jarvis we are not even talking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068785_0069057 the eight is sometimes a bit of a gripple
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0070178_0070244 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0072615_0073007 that would reduce the number of windows you needed would not it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073007_0073095 tschüss euer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073095_0073445 photoshop has a lot of windows if you ever use photoshop it is got loads of windows
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073445_0073665 and you are always forever going oh get out the way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073665_0073815 it is tough in a way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0074777_0074938 enjoy your lesson
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0075352_0075888 unless can you i do not suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that yeah you can minimise them can you do that yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0075888_0076047 okay well that is a lot easier
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0076088_0076284 of course you can yes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0080687_0080793 yeah sounds good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0085470_0085653 yeah that is what we needed
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0085653_0085983 something just slightly more than just that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0086536_0086642 definitely
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087094_0087314 i think that is kind of what he meant as well is not it yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087314_0087615 saying it sort of started a stuff rather than just being
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087802_0087921 and prototype with the gui
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0088642_0088721 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0090504_0090785 make it world readable then anybody can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0091683_0091941 i think by default they are not no they are not world readable
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0091941_0092409 they are only default then only you can read them
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0092409_0092544 you can see them but you can not really
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0093642_0093761 what is your number
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0094000_0094135 you do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0095296_0095388 and that is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0095883_0095940 system

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118966_0119388 and then we had to do an irp whatever it was last week as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0119388_0119603 which is only a page long but it is quite difficult to write a page
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0119796_0120427 ie dynan cyffredin iawn
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0120427_0120774 ja we wachten op je goh ja spannend
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0124483_0124642 so when it when it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125645_0125768 bu çok güzel
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125768_0125866 well i guess that is how it was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125951 and go
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0126161_0126273 that is pretty bizarre
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0126718_0126828 yay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0127051_0127129 nice proxxon
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0130698_0131380 for and it just has an open variable transcript whatever find everything that is got that and then load
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0132084_0132683 yeah yeah because that is the guy who declares a variable does not he and then yeah because
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137198_0137323 oh i see
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137664_0137928 so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is that what you did
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0139133_0139328 i will finish it later i was just thinking that yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0140885_0141114 have you annotated your code oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0141114_0141347 actually in the moment it is gone
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142482_0142647 just kidding poor joseph

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192972_0193082 it is going up the wall
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0193221_0193326 yeah somebody i am sure has asked

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194976_0195055 yes which
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195055_0195472 and there is a photocopier with the clothes on it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195472_0195877 it is good weather
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197101_0197132 out
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197316_0197367 nie
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0198132_0198470 hopefully it is not that man is though it will not matter
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202080_0202399 some classes did and some classes did not yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202399_0202522 it is all really
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202522_0202670 yeah i think yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0203437_0203591 no i can not watch
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0206074_0206171 we trust you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209644_0209866 yeah i think your comments are basically the same as what you just said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209866_0209900 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212177_0212273 sitting
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212600_0212704 signing off
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212704_0212767 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0000096_0000665 i wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002147_0002311 none of the words
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002707_0002820 sounds like you have done some
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0019845_0020242 to just have the same sort of video throughout
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023050_0023188 it is the wednesdays it is not as expensive
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023188_0023463 like if we want to add more things in the future we need buttons
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023463_0023492 yep
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023492_0023804 where is the menu i think it is more flexible
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023804_0024042 i guess
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024287_0024381 what you can have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024381_0024516 instead of
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024516_0024746 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030336_0030633 yeah like maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030633_0030899 and speaker characterization
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030899_0031139 just some way to sort of leverage that information
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031139_0031547 like we have it we are doing it but how does it help the browsing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031547_0031789 or what can it give us
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0036844_0036914 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037629_0037844 that just from the rain
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037844_0038530 one thing from any particular window like we want to sort of get like if we are on the users versus like a topic or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0038530_0038786 yeah wait
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0039767_0039903 right yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040228_0040305 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040426_0040582 de la vie dune façon thérapeutique
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040582_0040671 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042611_0042816 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042816_0043260 like we have it so set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043260_0043622 i mean that is kind of a typical common action
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043622_0044106 if you double click on a particular topic or something that it goes to sort of like a default view
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044106_0044434 so it will be like all the cases of that topic
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044434_0044882 either whatever we decide the default to be whether it is in all meetings or just in one meeting
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044882_0045291 and just show up the particular instances of that topic in the meeting
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045291_0045449 like i am just thinking to have the default there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045449_0045889 so if somebody knows exactly what they want to do we know that that is the most common thing that is going to happen
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045889_0046271 so the double click will do that and just save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0046605_0046933 well it might come to us
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047144_0047355 like we have the right click menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047355_0047814 yeah right click but instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047814_0048253 i agree it will be a choice for the new employee
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050686_0050787 it is still coming
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050787_0050871 oh then they close it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050901_0051245 it is not the end of the world
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0056935_0057122 it is time to go
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0061525_0062063 i think we probably need that though to have the full flexibility we need to have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0062635_0063079 well the thing is typically though is someone going to have five windows open at the same time probably not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0063079_0063650 probably not no two or three or whatever two or three maybe but yeah it depends
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0064658_0064727 but it would be good to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066363_0066473 it is like having a child there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066473_0066660 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0067707_0067992 i do not think java knows how to do that bernie maybe
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0070776_0071251 yeah or even just have buttons on it toggle buttons or something on the toolbar for that window
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071444_0071496 something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071604_0071899 lot of different ways we can do it it does not have to be a tab or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071899_0072058 no no it could be like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072507_0072576 or check marks
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072576_0072925 o ran y ffyrdd o ffyrdd
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0073677_0073785 it is tough in a way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0075628_0075840 yeah you can minimize it can you do that yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076219_0076581 like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluences out then we can you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076581_0077006 transcript without the disfluency transcript with a different discipline yeah that is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077006_0077098 соболвись не у
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077098_0077878 we will have all these sort of using the same window until we can define yeah they are definitely going to be in the same window and probably mutually dis 
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077878_0077947 and trust me
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0080447_0080587 do you want to do that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082308_0082395 i am just putting it somewhere
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082870_0083007 i
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0085854_0085988 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089197_0089641 actually is the code accessible like the gui stuff that you have done
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089641_0090010 can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090010_0090601 like if we are gonna just try and like take a look or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090732_0091278 well if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable and we know the directory to get in yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091362_0091506 i do not know if it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091705_0091985 i think by default they are not no they are not world readable
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0092565_0092653 trippin
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093261_0093398 great for just in the mail
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093398_0093531 okay yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093531_0093627 here
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0096404_0096606 what were you thinking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101290_0101489 i will be searching
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101489_0101940 every file stuff the next search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102357_0102731 so you could probably just use that code like that was behind the question she asked
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102731_0103149 you know the reusing code and stuff which is like okay hey you found
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0103286_0103406 yeah well i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104422_0104524 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104524_0104872 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104872_0105003 messing around
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0111840_0111900 screen

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117533_0118031 what do you mean this week is only two days on well whatever it was last week oh last week
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118578_0118835 well you are an spnlp and sp two right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118835_0118904 that is fine

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121271_0121856 yeah i was thinking the weekend probably start attacking this seriously
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121856_0122358 hopefully have something by next week that we can sort of try integrating into the gui
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0122504_0122604 which should be possible
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127378_0127795 well they did say it was not the most efficient
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127795_0128003 so i do not quite believe that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0142505_0142623 okay flip this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0144017_0144115 okay thank you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145397_0145576 yeah for sure
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145873_0145886 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146004_0146201 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146304_0146826 i am still at the bottom of the mountain how many hours is this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0147120_0147459 to explore any other
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0148212_0148293 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149554_0149614 who was doing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149880_0150007 you do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150178_0150270 well i will do that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150288_0150408 this can be changed
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150408_0150546 thanks
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150546_0150752 i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150752_0150839 if you want to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150839_0151060 let us just play around with some extra stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0151060_0151220 have some time why not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153025_0153272 so i think the informatics course
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153272_0153425 yeah it is a
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153425_0153739 how we play digital
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0156246_0156562 i will be happy when this week is over
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157002_0157469 i do not know what is odd about it though anything else we need to discuss
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157652_0158052 did we want to meet before we talk to steve next week
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158298_0158434 well i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158434_0159102 we will probably get some work done over the weekend so i know after dnlg or something maybe just have a little quick little update and just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159414_0159510 well we can decide then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159510_0159565 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160177_0160605 you are gonna do the search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160605_0160782 could not get it on either
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160782_0161336 it will be still a limited version of the next query
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161336_0161524 끝
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161524_0161669 will not be the whole thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161669_0161948 like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162062_0162239 well actually moses just died a long time ago
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162239_0162386 and this was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0163096_0163352 there is some of my toolbox changing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0164731_0165115 yeah it gets behind schedule pretty quick
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165115_0165239 like you are saying
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165239_0165581 well actually do we want to set a date for interim prototype
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165701_0165820 specifically a date
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0174020_0174401 yes it is quite impressive is not it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0175200_0175308 yes you are right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177666_0177789 nice nice
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177789_0177962 so decide on that on the weekend
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0179495_0179561 molto
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181028_0181137 just like the bass
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181137_0181361 no already what
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181742_0182107 just like all that and seeing the code and just sort of how just see the basics of what you have done
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182107_0182452 we just get a quick look over and just can take a tutorial
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182497_0182770 or like you know the class paths all that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182770_0183332 yeah just jump right in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183644_0183749 thanks for watching
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183976_0184292 in the morning
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184735_0184862 you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184862_0185309 well the thing is something like that could happen any time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185309_0185690 like my schedule is like a class break class break class
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185690_0185974 it is not going to take an hour yeah i know exactly exactly that is what i am thinking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185974_0186364 so something like that and then if i have a class one can run off pick your time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0186612_0186822 it is a monday it is monday my period
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187025_0187110 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187237_0187767 anytime not at noon or two or four
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187767_0188059 no in between those you know like one or three
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189157_0189286 yeah that is an option too
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189286_0189383 and doctorate
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189596_0189653 it is very good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190197 or three point three zero
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190197_0190345 i am just yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190345_0190549 necessary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190727_0190876 actually we just had this kid in there though
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0191260_0191791 can i have you get we can get in through the through the big this computer rooms in here the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192004_0192373 how many have you taken well if you find me i will show you where i will let us all in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192373_0192682 there and we can look at it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192682_0192781 see ya dude
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193087_0193279 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193279_0193562 she was asking steve about that whether we can get in there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193562_0193757 whether he was going to get us access into the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193869_0193922 the computer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194295_0194371 it would do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194872_0194961 is there a printer there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195394_0195537 that is a good one
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195537_0195672 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195774_0196406 we could photocopy your assignment
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0196431_0196575 well the comments i am thinking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197063_0197125 yeah it is up
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197125_0197320 so doctor d knows
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197879_0198035 as long as team lg does not go late
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199514_0199666 i was like me too
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199840_0199917 right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199917_0199994 watch from the post
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199994_0200131 for a big change
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200785_0200843 thanks for having me
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200979_0201027 dangerous
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0201901_0202026 something like that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202026_0202188 i think one of a couple some close
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202392_0202622 it was all really bad
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202622_0202650 think big
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202962_0203257 it goes up to the professor whether they did it or not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203257_0203347 well i do not feel like it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203347_0203466 no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203466_0203610 i think what
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203610_0204092 i think the il will probably have one to make up for missing classes what
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0204092_0204431 dil will probably have quite a lot of money
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0206079_0206202 we trust you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0207928_0208146 any problem
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208436_0208731 you really want multiple windows from a single web
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208960_0209241 but most will probably want to go with the faults
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209692_0209717 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209873_0210490 and exactly and just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210621_0210766 from this point
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210766_0210858 that works
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0002480_0002851 the worst difference
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004285_0004363 to eat
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004581_0004696 bye
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0006202_0006252 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008166_0008661 very interesting start of the meeting
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008661_0008947 i am gonna go put something down
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0023120_0024443 perfection
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024443_0024853 and i am being like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024853_0025092 hehe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0025508_0025538 i will see you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0026675_0027547 i will look at it like when my usual working hours are like from twelve oclock to three oclock or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0027547_0029410 i know he always online it always makes me feel bad when i go to bed at like one you are still online you never go to bed sleep just leave your computer on maybe yeah he pretends oh it is busy yeah right so maybe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029410_0029595 but i am never online in the morning
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029595_0030227 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0030764_0031418 yeah do what you want to do with it perfect and then i will i will have this i told you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0031418_0031794 was there anything else we wanted
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033101_0033591 probably want to think about if we want to change our goals and stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033591_0034574 i think one thing that we could probably skip totally is the removing things from the body of fire
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0034821_0035259 gonna attempt that no i do not think so
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0037281_0037580 yeah but that is definitely one thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0041751_0041938 might you know develop prototype gooey
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0042617_0044950 yeah more or less plus or minus three days he does not have to know it i mean yeah it is not finished but so i have only got six days to do the topic segment you do not have any spnl psi on this team
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053678_0053740 um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053740_0054016 we should probably sorry we should probably
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0056905_0057415 chewy i do not know i think my but our things that we have gathered
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057415_0057650 split those apart
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057650_0058070 i am sure you will have a great time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058198_0058396 i do not know this one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058396_0058593 well if we are skipping the audio
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058775_0059373 just keep it together on the paper
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059565_0059750 met de discussies
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059750_0059870 okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0060478_0060694 yeah we could just make it up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064215_0064651 yeah my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064651_0065348 i mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065842_0065968 this is it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065968_0066281 and also sometimes it is a bit of a motivating factor too
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066281_0066343 right down
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066765_0066801 boop
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067581_0067962 well i still like struggling with java stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067962_0068274 yeah but we will work on it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068274_0068805 i think i was wondering about that is i have not looked at it so much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068805_0069665 but if you guys know how you could do the like from the extract words that you did
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0069665_0070203 like also extract time samson yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074139_0074374 so now i can just put it in some
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074504_0074606 from the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074844_0074902 god allah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0075883_0075962 punch
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0089209_0089625 no okay so it is just when we click
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0090755_0090862 all of them at the same time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0115911_0115974 what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0118646_0118718 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0121631_0121738 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0123724_0123835 yeah only only
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0125288_0125530 okay then that is not says something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0126896_0127147 i mean we are not really well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127290_0127571 we are not gonna do much more than just look at the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127716_0128450 the room like the textbook room with the different fluences because we are not gonna search it and we are not gonna like listen to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128644_0128816 that is what i am doing the audio thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128989_0129377 so i guess just displaying it is fine
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0129377_0129503 yeah yeah yeah do not read
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0130870_0130929 because that is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131677_0131891 it is probably the best we will do in season
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131891_0132149 i do not think it is gonna take long to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0153855_0154032 well i mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0169683_0170405 maybe sleep
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0170405_0170552 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0171979_0172091 i do not know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172091_0172338 yeah okay actually that is a good idea
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172761_0173069 stick it together she will shine it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0173660_0174199 anchoring back any things that i thought was wrong in english or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174199_0174381 they were changing dialogue
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174381_0174703 i love you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175396_0175540 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175540_0175983 i am going to do more lines with a little bit of pink
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175983_0176353 um yeah twelve thirty tomorrow with
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012414 love tomo

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014437_0014850 i am not sure if we need the outline of the prototype
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014850_0015021 we are going to put
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015441_0015688 yep that is good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015688_0015753 the hole

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026664_0026730 끝
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027533_0027852 i know you are always online
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027852_0028436 it always makes me feel bad because when i go to bed at like one you are still online
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028436_0028592 he never did
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028865_0029045 yeah he pretend
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029045_0029133 always busy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029133_0029280 you are right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029280_0029409 so maybe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032386_0032508 on that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032508_0032636 yes you received the original
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032636_0032810 oh this is the one that okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0034547_0034909 that is what i thought as well i mean are we actually going to attempt that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035060_0035247 i think so i have two feet
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035247_0035573 i think that is going to be we do not even know how to approach that at the moment
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036630_0036715 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036715_0036928 yeah yeah that is right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036928_0037935 cover some sort of time warp thing so maybe i mean we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0037935_0038266 but put it under changes since the initial specification
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0038266_0038901 and say you know we did not we decided the time is too short
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0039384_0039848 we would prefer to concentrate on the main
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0040496_0041100 and i think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041252_0041505 or some of them were a bit later
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041758_0041920 you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041920_0042435 yeah nice nice lady best
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042609_0042719 yeah more or less
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042719_0042856 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045213_0045428 and you can say yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045428_0046024 we are still aiming for the development to be completely in march right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0047485_0047593 はい
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048189_0048321 yeah that is right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048321_0048439 i really want to do it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048439_0048678 it is not going to be difficult
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048678_0049161 if at least have all the information pop up that is already in the metadata file
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049161_0049366 that is gotta be what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049366_0049523 so it is definitely going to be something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0050130_0050484 yeah we might turn up eden and
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0052660_0052741 yeah sounds good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053015_0053059 to move
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053774_0054353 we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0054353_0054961 that is what he hinted that we should also indicate who is responsible for what from now on
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0055764_0056002 way to put you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0060677_0060763 oh my god
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0061496_0061766 have you managed any further on the search thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0062920_0062973 so i will be working on that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0063613_0063708 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0076781_0077134 so is there have you made another mbrowser
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0077134_0077273 is there something i should
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078221_0078524 no since you do not do it no since it is friday night
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078524_0078671 i thought you said okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079643_0079886 i have done it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079886_0080250 weekends out
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0083744_0083850 i am sorry mama
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084213_0084627 at the moment is there a window that comes up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084627_0084835 what is that a second result of pain
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084835_0085080 you know as soon as they get larger
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0085080_0085345 i thought we were sort of
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090405_0090683 tabs but then you can not
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090855_0091354 but you want to compare the result the one topic result with one summary result
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091653_0091831 i do not see all the results
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091831_0092168 yeah if you get results for the same meeting
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092292_0092417 so the summary in the top
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092417_0092558 i think i am going to try
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093213_0093492 i mean we could order them by meeting for example
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093846_0093986 reorder
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093986_0094497 yeah well i mean in the second step the first question is do we want to order them
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0094497_0094659 how do we want to order them in the first place
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0095725_0095842 yeah maybe you should do that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098204_0098433 yeah why do not you just um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098544_0098638 color code does
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098797_0099022 the results to sometimes in a case
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101350_0101436 no but if you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101561_0101936 if you do it straight from you know you get you get the result
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101936_0102270 and then there is some if statement saying straight on the you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0102270_0102935 rock bottom level saying if you found a segment then colour it print it use red or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103083_0103179 as opposed to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103884_0103924 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104204_0104330 trying to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104991_0105085 cool
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105335_0105452 working within a van
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105878_0106013 oh oh i see ya
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106358_0106545 we will figure something else like that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106955_0107583 yeah i mean at the moment it works with highlighting in the transcript window does not it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0109010_0109145 what do you mean you need to work with him
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0110572_0111480 yeah i mean the whole what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pain made by night
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111480_0111676 i am not sure i am in school now
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111951_0112094 she
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112214_0112478 i do not know what anyone is called
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112478_0112878 and that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112878_0113350 as i said if you left click on something for example it highlights automatically
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0113350_0113593 so maybe it comes with something clever as well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114147_0114464 no i am sure there is a lot of pain in it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114635_0114909 i do not know text area yeah something like that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114909_0115049 i might can not
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115049_0115317 norm takes mostly things are called norm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115317_0115547 yeah what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115547_0115719 knight object model
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122144_0122353 why do you why do we want it in xml there
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122353_0122857 i mean i thought we would just selectively selectively write the xml that we have got
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123113_0123303 so as opposed to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123577_0123610 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123720_0124313 yeah only print out certain segments the segments that we want just selectively
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124313_0124485 at the moment it prints out all of them
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124485_0124910 wel rydyn nin mynd i ddod yn ffwrdd ir ffwrdd
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124910_0125118 not store it at all whatsoever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0125724_0125789 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129048_0129102 so i guess
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129404_0129617 yeah yeah you do not really need to do much more with it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129617_0129694 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0131930_0132233 i do not think it is going to take long to produce anyway
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0132233_0133122 it is just another i mean these meetings are not endlessly long it is just words and to print all of them out selectively
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0134416_0135016 you can nearly do it together with the transcription with the original transcription have them run parallel
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135186_0135590 so if it is a proper word
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135590_0136024 print it on both both panes and if it is not proper word then print only on one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136024_0136232 i mean that is fancy but
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136493_0136570 yay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137075_0137136 today
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137251_0138184 you know the good way of doing it not together is that if someone does not want to look at the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138184_0138407 the chop file and you do not ever have to produce it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138548_0138826 but i mean you can you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138826_0139583 you can write we can write something like we will try and do it on the fly and and observe if it is not gonna it is gonna take too long
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0139583_0140140 if it is going to take too long when i will think about writing it to a file
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0140299_0140382 fastest
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0141684_0141738 home
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0151881_0152103 that is what programming is all about i am afraid
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153323_0153432 bye
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153895_0153967 well i mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154087_0154810 yeah why do not you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say you will have a look at both or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154810_0154970 if you want to do it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154970_0155409 i personally do not want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0155409_0155526 i do not want to do it superficially
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0158643_0158795 well it has already loaded it anyway

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161799_0161936 no you can split that up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0162278_0162642 yeah like this is what we have done already and then you know lose a bit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164106_0164193 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164255_0164357 yeah maybe

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020992_0021379 i have written the topic segmentation alright cool
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022275_0022355 that is how i am
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022355_0022375 you

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0031135_0031257 ça va être ça lingénieur
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0035738_0036107 it is a good thing to have to say what we could have done if we had more time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036107_0036226 it is a good future work thing is not it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036226_0036472 sticking to the conclusion it is a fun report
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036472_0036842 should have we had more time yeah yeah yeah yeah that is right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0037097_0037360 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038504_0038624 we decided to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038837_0039136 there are more important things to do with our time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0039295_0039468 than wearing them
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041533_0041627 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041627_0041784 i am sure that section might
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042375_0042600 westfau umtrage und so
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042801_0043608 plus or minus three days
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0044105_0044380 so i have only got six days to do the topic segment
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0045439_0045574 we are still
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046016_0046324 it is a biggie characterisation that is supposed to be done already oh really
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046324_0046575 yeah two days ago um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047298_0047592 give me a week and i will tell you the answer to that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047900_0048145 maybe the speaker characterisation may get slimmer
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0048322_0048580 we really want to do it we work this a few more
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049534_0049781 yeah we might make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049921_0050095 de bújj már ne a hírevelőn mártan
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050095_0050312 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050861_0051348 the topic segmentation with lc sagan textiles is basically done
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051348_0051744 maen dweud bod hin ddifrif
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051744_0052069 search the parameters but it is man
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0052069_0052298 and see what happens
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0055240_0055341 yeah pretty much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0065809_0065877 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0066825_0067239 how about the underlying data for it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067239_0067390 for the inverted file
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067390_0067474 that is incredible
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0068144_0068204 come on
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070071_0070141 easy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070141_0071209 yeah we just when he pulls up the segments part of that one of those one of the attributes we do get attributes
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071209_0071456 ymwneud âr gweithdai
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071456_0071927 search through those and then that will tell you what attributes it is got
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071927_0072435 and then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard code and say look get me the time steps
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0072435_0073145 so you just say get attribute import i think the method is called get attribute and it is called start time and end time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073145_0073437 okay and that will tell you the start times and end times
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073437_0073534 i think it would set a double
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074447_0074908 yeah that is on the non right elements
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074908_0075230 the object is a non right element
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0075640_0075774 أكثر تنطالياً
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088240_0088442 what happened you confused me
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088442_0088847 do you have three separate windows for the three separate different types of
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089021_0089334 ie nid yn wir yn wahanol
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089480_0089529 night
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0090204_0090299 or until then i will see you next time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0091839_0091961 yeah very good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0113936_0114207 you feel the night text pain or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114207_0114225 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114691_0114955 yeah something like that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115139_0115208 なっちゃいそう
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115208_0115321 mostly things called norm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115533_0115991 nid ywn dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud y byddain dweud er byddai erddai erddai erddai
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115991_0116432 night objects model
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0117869_0117982 but they um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118130_0118569 the removing the discolourances have you done anything with that yet
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118766_0119675 because i was wondering how we are going to write it back to html i mean xml if we take if we did the processing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0119829_0119979 writing about tokyo samoa
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120575_0120691 this is a bit of text
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120820_0120872 text flow
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121398_0121828 you will very much limit what you can do with it if it is nine x or more
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121828_0122215 there is some bizarre method that puts things back into excellent form why do you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0123311_0123783 select what we want just take bits of the xml and take certain segments
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124458_0124617 yeah or just put a niffler over it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124617_0124713 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124713_0124801 certain things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124801_0124917 i found it yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125458_0125580 it says something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125580_0125640 thanks for watching
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125789_0125942 yn ystod y cyfnod
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125942_0126120 this makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126120_0126533 but that will mean that you can only do things on actually no because you can do things on word level
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126533_0126623 so yeah that is fine
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129316_0129464 this one is tough
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129659_0129757 i think it is like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130301_0130473 would just be a blurb like a summary
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130473_0130975 it will not look like it will not say speaker x says this speaker y says that speaker z says this
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131287_0131598 they all look ugly probably because it all looks just black and white
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131598_0131725 unless you have got a start up plan
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0132163_0132382 use anyway it is just another
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133236_0133358 it does not on the fly anyway does it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133510_0133859 so then it just goes through and says if this word equals that imprint
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0134183_0134337 it is the bunch of histories
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136501_0136598 yeah you probably could
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136598_0136789 that is probably not as difficult
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136789_0136955 you just did not flatten the curve out a bit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136955_0137127 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0138300_0138507 do not ever have to produce it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140016_0140051 to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140051_0140536 they will just be if statements
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140536_0140696 i was just thinking low rise in this property
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0141246_0141295 that is it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0143934_0144261 alwaen yn y plai ywn tebyg
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144261_0144569 even trying to read it in xml would be complicated enough
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144569_0145137 i gave up doing that because i devoted back to night stuff because it was not too much easy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145283_0145518 so we can do it with night stuff too and all those kind of things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145518_0145969 maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen dweud maen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146180_0146289 i could not believe it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146289_0147004 you have to start defining object models like the night thing and game all bizarre weird things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0147004_0147093 so cheers
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0157867_0157939 i spent a week
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0158908_0159085 yeah it is after it is loaded
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159237_0159400 it is just a for loop really
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159400_0159494 see ya
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0160891_0161131 i included the future work in my own section
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0161282_0162274 i just said what i have done so far and what i am going to do yeah well maybe you could split that up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162274_0162383 i am saying it is this
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162560_0162760 might lose a bit of continuity if you do that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162760_0162852 valeu sou eu siki
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162852_0163194 sometimes it is easier to have the top in its own intersections
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163194_0163417 so you talk about speaking characters and seeing weird things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163985_0164101 schouders
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164101_0164355 yeah bullet points
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164381_0164747 because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164747_0165061 if they are not together you lose a lot of continuity
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0165202_0165243 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0168522_0168675 excellent
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172742_0172828 used to get together
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172828_0172899 she will shine it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0176443_0176700 it is just devo
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178273_0178394 twelve days of writing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178394_0178659 ما صباحاً هي أمس
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003903_0003990 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003990_0004240 i would like to announce this one because what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004240_0004381 i will take notes
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004495_0004612 machines
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004745_0005954 actually i guess the first thing i did was a really brief version of what we have to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0005954_0006231 hmm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012470_0012730 actually for that i was just copying one straight over the other document
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012730_0013102 so it is all whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0013772_0013822 yet
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014111_0014174 oh shi 
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014174_0014244 chain
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015004_0015184 well just sort of well the thing is yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015184_0015707 we are going to be touching on all that during the other part of the program yeah if you remember that screenshots and all the rest
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015707_0015897 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015897_0016426 well it is just something that he had mentioned in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype together
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016426_0016728 i am just saying that we could potentially do that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016728_0016792 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016792_0016898 she is got something there
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017730_0017785 yeah sure
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017785_0018043 like the thing is i was thinking even in the stuff that i was doing i mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018043_0018395 just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you are doing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018395_0018519 can not hear the hacks we can just ignore them
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018519_0018560 time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018560_0018829 oh yes yeah well actually i have that at the very end screenshots
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018829_0018936 i will put that in chop on the screen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018936_0019111 i do not know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020934 anyways so yeah this is just a very general structure i guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs i do not know yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021133_0021163 all right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021313_0021454 feliz
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021454_0021977 so i know if there is other stuff that you think should be done to this i could do that before i made one to you guys
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021977_0022293 otherwise no
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0022293_0022953 does anyone else want to throw it together actually i can probably still throw it together if you want put your parts into this one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023125_0023329 yeah perfection
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023630_0023745 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023745_0024214 let us just cut out the middle man yeah exactly because i am going to tell if you got it wrong anyway
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0024214_0024440 bye
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0027526_0027739 i know he is always online
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028668_0028943 can we just leave your computer on
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028943_0029179 you pretend always busy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0029731_0030110 notice that no one is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030110_0030238 thank you

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031677_0031881 was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031881_0032249 i mean essentially was what you can see here
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032249_0032460 honestly
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032460_0032772 well that is the original oh this is the one that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032772_0033027 yeah yeah it was just copied straight out
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0036788_0037258 unless we discover some sort of time warp thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0038142_0038232 and it is glitch
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041160_0041286 this this world
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041286_0041566 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041566_0041631 okay then
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042654_0042791 more or less
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042881_0042968 sorry
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042968_0043351 points for minus three days
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043351_0043505 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043505_0043786 i mean yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044331_0044624 jesus
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044624_0045064 you do not have any spl psi on this do you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046238_0046442 oh really yeah two days ago
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046442_0046502 i love you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046502_0047118 um for one of those something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0047576_0047898 like should we put a hint that something like that might happen into the document
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0048484_0048561 no
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049218_0049277 yeah i agree
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049277_0049343 et cetera
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049542_0049639 okay that would make you disappear
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0051551_0051685 tuned the cut yeah tuned
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0054984_0055312 like probably just copy that straight over the other one as well yeah pretty much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055312_0055519 that is essentially the same as it was
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055519_0055766 more detail
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057504_0057594 split those apart
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057638_0057891 that looks like you are having a great time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057891_0058016 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0058470_0058757 well if we are skipping the audio one then it is not easy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059159_0059383 have you taken your morphine
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059383_0059545 will you take any more of a look at it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059545_0059671 i have no disciplines
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059852_0059926 we could probably
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060166_0060504 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060504_0060724 we could just make it up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060724_0061147 like i will claim one you claim the other for the search things and then we can leave that one as a joint one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061295_0061394 come on bicky
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061780_0062365 i found finally today something that i can build it in and i should have something for tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0062365_0063158 i should at least very least have a gui i will be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063158_0063436 i want to get something i want to see this together
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063436_0063952 i have an image of my mom and i just want to see it on the thing and then get my screenshot
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065078_0065557 it does not really matter i mean you can write the sentences first as well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065557_0065912 i mean with the intention that yeah this is done
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065912_0066273 and also sometimes it is a bit of a motivating factor too
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066273_0066537 write down the words and the ideas as home okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066537_0066801 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0067941_0067973 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077159_0077621 there is but i have not made a lot of changes to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077621_0077969 so i might just delete what i have done and copy it in from yours
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077969_0078306 because i am sure you have probably made some changes already not since you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078306_0078362 tamam
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078362_0078473 since friday night
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078539_0078676 i thought you said okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078676_0078817 all right i see
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078856_0079508 i thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were going to fix those on the weekend or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079508_0079598 no oh oklahoma
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0079847 okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079969_0080142 talking like a
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080142_0080966 yes all of their stuff of it actually i am gonna try and minimize the amount of changes i make to my browser anyways
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080966_0081036 cześć
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081165_0081248 championship
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081248_0081582 actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081582_0082029 like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082114_0082502 do we want separate result panes for each of those
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082502_0083092 or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or different color or something to indicate what type of result they are
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083092_0083471 so that when they click on that it is going to go to the relevant thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083471_0083998 like just if they check all three same topics so we have three different windows come up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0084148_0084359 or three like some
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085039_0085733 what do you want i thought what we sort of discussed last week was to have it sort of on the same window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085733_0086046 so it will be on the search window bottom half search window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086046_0086485 i know we still want to keep it that way but that is that is what it is gonna be working
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086485_0086802 so it is just like you click those and it just loads up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086802_0087255 yeah split step thing into two or three or whatever it is one hundred and twenty three depending on which
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087255_0087384 ones a check
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087384_0087866 and so if we want to do it that way you know like it probably does not matter too much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087866_0088246 just try and think if there is going to be any other issues down the road
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0088813_0089409 no just pains just result pains okay not really different no no no
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089409_0089503 cest bon
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089503_0089859 so it is just when we click you know topics and summaries for what we want to search
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089859_0090212 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090212_0090467 tabs i do not know really tabs
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090467_0090932 but then you can not see all of them at the same time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0091303_0091783 well it is no but the thing is if you are looking if you could check them both you will see all the results
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092178_0092282 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092314_0093320 so the summary and the topic and the training that is true or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0093620_0094088 oh yeah i guess that is the other thing whether we want to have this reorder yeah well let me think
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094088_0094233 well that is it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094233_0094296 second
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094729_0094978 i think yeah probably by meeting makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094978_0095288 i mean essentially they are in time order
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095288_0095598 so that kind of makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095767_0095835 shit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096204_0096458 should be easy no i do not know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096458_0096585 should be fairly easy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0098888_0099364 thinking sometimes in a case like that like a run across some other languages
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099364_0099946 it is hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it is put into a list box or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099946_0100175 hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100175_0100452 and then if we are highlighting something in the transcript window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100452_0101260 it may be difficult to get that information back once it is just in a list box an item in a list box
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101260_0101496 no but if you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101496_0101599 where is it coming from
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103036_0103108 as a
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103329_0103842 um yeah it is just like from past experience there is goofy little things that happen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103842_0104599 just to let you save certain things and just kind of try to do a different kind of to go to a different window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0104599_0105080 so if you want to go to the actual highlight the transcript i highlight the topic
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105080_0105308 at that point that is where it starts getting a little bit tricky
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105308_0105835 because you are working with an event handler within the one panel or a loose box or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105835_0105890 감사합니다
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106024_0106677 there are ways around it but you know whether i will be able to figure something out like actually before tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106677_0106952 or do not get to learn
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106952_0107083 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107588_0107656 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107851_0108601 i think he was saying that as long as we implement that interface it should work with anything that we do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108601_0108763 like highlighting
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108763_0109120 i think that was a song what do you mean you need to rework with the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109120_0109343 um was not jonathan saying something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109343_0109760 i think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109760_0110058 when we should be able to have that highlighting happen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110058_0110116 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110116_0110158 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0113476_0113968 okay maybe i should use that as well anyway
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115367_0115504 what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115704_0115871 okay that makes sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0119968_0120335 i thought we were just going to have that as words
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0120335_0121016 like not as xml just sort of as a as a bluff text what was that though text file well transcript
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121016_0121339 transcript no because then we need all the other data if we want to keep it to transcript
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121635_0121783 yeah i will see you again
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121783_0121815 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125252_0125286 sorry ed
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125286_0125531 okay then that is not say something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125531_0125664 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125664_0125902 that is right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125902_0126033 actually but this makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0126624_0126989 yeah if we are going to do the experimental one fine
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129344_0129433 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129704_0130120 but i think it is like well how would we display the like if we do take this fluency zone and just you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130120_0130471 just be a summary
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130967_0131486 unless we extract that over the file when we create the text file yeah then it will look ugly probably because it will look just
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0131568_0131631 that is flashy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140401_0140531 slurp
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140531_0141101 i was just thinking as well we could probably even use xslt to kind of just transform it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141101_0141775 flip it into just transforms on like um style sheet
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141775_0142195 and then it is kind of like there is usually things built into well it should be built into java
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142195_0142837 and to process xml into like just create whatever file it is gonna be in
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142837_0143107 it is been a couple years since i have looked at anything like this
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143107_0143373 that might even be an easier way
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143373_0143725 and then that way we could even pre process that beforehand
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143725_0143963 i do not know we do not want to have to do that right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143963_0144215 although unapplied to the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144532_0144657 i gave up doing that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144657_0144731 i am able with
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0145444_0145524 okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146551_0146596 i do not know why i did not think of that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146596_0146733 and gangsters
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146895_0146946 soon
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147168_0147522 i was thinking i might try and talk to who is it jonathan gene
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147522_0147857 like just to see what they what system they use to develop this stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147857_0148685 because it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything just to actually use the system
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148685_0148921 you know at a higher level rather than kind of you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148921_0149202 playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149202_0149408 i think i should just sort of see what they are doing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149408_0149827 so i might try and contact them see if there is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149964_0150225 neither hence the video ones
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150225_0150542 just to get things i do not know moving at a higher level i guess
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150688_0151137 seems to be more interesting to use it as a real developer
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151304_0151743 it just seemed like a little tinkering here and there and just adding a couple things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151889_0151929 that is cool
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152034_0152305 no no it should not be
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152305_0152397 from chibi haruwa
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152397_0153316 it should be conceptual and coming up with the brilliant ideas and then just bringing those to reality
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0153441_0153811 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0155864_0156372 like the thing that i was thinking there as well is that once it is done for one meeting it is done
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156372_0156430 it is fine
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156430_0156582 text file or xml or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156582_0157089 yeah just i do not know it just it does not make any difference really either way to me
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157089_0157402 it is like if it is fast enough on the fly then sure
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157402_0157749 that is about the only issue i have with on the fly whether it is fastened
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157956_0158182 especially with java
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0158182_0158649 if it is loading a file processing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0159496_0159838 where they run to their memory yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161181_0161213 all right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161805_0161922 you can split that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0162054_0162383 i will link into it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163146_0163210 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163372_0163537 i think that does make sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163537_0164018 maybe at the end maybe just a point form of you know things that we are still working on things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164018_0164192 oedd
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164712_0164801 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0165141_0165226 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168112_0168210 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168501_0168596 two
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171165_0171447 or she will just take it she can take it from there
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171447_0171516 does not matter
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171516_0171724 how kind
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171724_0172114 i can get you if you want to see it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172114_0172473 yeah okay actually that is a good idea i will take one quick look over
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172473_0172728 try and get it as good as i think that we can
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0173283_0173628 i am gonna leave him out
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0174290_0174848 they were changing dialogue back i love you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0175479_0175581 hmm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176364_0176543 oh oh oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176882_0177179 come here
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0005327_0005656 did we get a seven out of ten for real yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0010714_0010759 come on
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012507_0012860 i think there is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012860_0014128 just because the topic box and all this is based on what was it called non night text area or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014128_0014333 and text her at all
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014333_0014626 it has some sort of highlighting stuff there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014626_0014856 so you should probably look at the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0015536_0015731 i am not sure if it is inbuilt though to be honest
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0016668_0016786 wink wink
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018250_0018339 il a non
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018339_0018522 if you want to do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018522_0018869 yeah i was thinking about it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0019053_0019099 thank you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0021698_0021836 and there is a lot of different ways to do it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0022987_0023159 okay yeah same with me
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023159_0023237 everything but that is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023237_0023267 firewood
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023520_0024002 so have you already calculated all this data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0024002_0024042 my own r 
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0026456_0026737 i am just thinking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0031624_0031695 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0033862_0034307 what the easiest thing to do how are you going to do this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034307_0034400 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034863_0035710 so whenever we open a window for one speaker
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036852_0036935 nie
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036935_0037078 pretty much on the ball
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0038146_0038190 how is it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042122_0042347 the one present
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042347_0042747 although we could do we could do a one highlighted aspect
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0044963_0045399 i mean that would be implementing what he said
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045399_0045889 that you want to see per topic you want to see which one spoken most something like that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045889_0046420 so you could zap through these topics meetings meeting sorry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0046420_0047031 and it would come up with how much they spoke and you could pick the one that looks more yeah that would be easier as well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047031_0047163 dwin golygu hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047936_0048004 yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0048166_0048640 so yeah random things like just return talking time yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0049178_0049243 so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055128_0055476 can you put in there what topic we are speaking about as well yeah yeah that will be
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055476_0055829 i could use that for the prototopic pop up window
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056075_0056113 but that would
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056541_0056607 that was not well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0057730_0058078 because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0058078_0058747 you have the option of popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060366_0060622 so how would you calculate that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060622_0061042 would you do the summarization as you populate it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061042_0061259 what the global statistics come straight off of that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061553_0062005 oh right so that is all stored together the speaker class knows about all of that stuff
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062005_0062172 and the meat seemed to astonish a bit
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062567_0062708 that is good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062708_0063054 so have you done these yet no no but i know it is difficult
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063054_0063276 just gotta decide on what we wanna
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063527_0063800 i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063948_0064594 so it is all usable now can i do it tonight no design the game first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0066667_0066722 молодцы
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067308_0067648 well let me know when it is sort of usable
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067648_0067710 if you can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068138_0068232 what do you mean a picture
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068232_0068607 yeah but it is not going to take very long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068607_0068783 i mean is not it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070272_0070386 so i am scared
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070386_0070452 so where is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070452_0070695 is that stored in the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070898_0071135 on your home directory not in there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0071468_0071520 actually i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0072563_0073206 what are you wanting to write that in directly or what do you want to do with that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073206_0073320 if you want to change my code
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073552_0074028 do you want to change that the original and browser file in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074028_0074121 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074288_0074356 have you done that now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074568_0074831 oh okay so not the actual one but a copy of it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075146_0075269 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075269_0075311 there we go
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075690_0075818 well just tell us when
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075818_0076625 because i usually work on my own copy all the day and then update it without checking if the one in the share has changed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0076625_0076783 i have not made any changes to it yet
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0077208_0077283 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0078579_0078992 those are the ones you are working on now to present the results
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0079726_0079893 you mean the highlighting stuff
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0081352_0082292 actually for any text area whatever it is they define some handy highlights on that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082292_0082443 so you have got different highlights
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082443_0082847 you have got just look at what they wrote about it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082847_0083407 they have got like user highlights selection highlights time highlights and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083564_0083648 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083866_0084550 so you can quite easily if your text area is called area you just do areasethighlights or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084550_0084615 thank you very much
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084903_0085417 that is the way i did it to highlight to cross highlight between topic and transcripts
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0085647_0085685 thank you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091133_0091466 but if you do not know like yeah it says like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091466_0092196 ie o iawn rwyn cael yr hysbys fe wnaeth ei gael yn y bryd maen dweud oh no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092196_0092783 it is a nice machine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092912_0093190 i have spent too much time on it already
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093287_0093764 i have been doing some random pop up windows for the speaker characterization which is good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093764_0093949 so feel that in now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093949_0094239 the windows are all there now after lots of filling
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094447_0094830 well you know just a pop up one a pop up it was difficult enough
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094830_0095852 because it basically has to set up like ten pop up windows in memory as in already initialize them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0095852_0097625 because there might be ten speakers they all have to have different windows and i am working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the topics of the meetings that topic was mentioned in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0097625_0098398 and i have a question about the you said we wanted a start screen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098398_0098686 what kind of start screen do we want
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098686_0099910 i mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser or something an lsd browser some speech and some music
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0099910_0100194 it does not take too long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0101016_0101819 so do we want yeah maybe we could write on like that whatever it is called the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0102824_0103036 yeah how
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103036_0103596 i mean at the moment the way it is it is a drop down menu as you see yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103596_0104380 with all the and that because it is the dialogue class that you use there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105197_0105814 i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105814_0106146 and through that once you have got the results you click on something stupid nfts
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106641_0106681 tchou tchou
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106846_0106986 the only thing that is such is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0109093_0109356 can you not get this norm object
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0110808_0111239 i suppose we would not want to use yeah we would not want to use nxt at the beginning anyway
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111239_0111597 because we do not want to search locally
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111597_0111799 so unless they
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112036_0112390 then they would open the meeting first right yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112390_0113079 so let us say you have two options either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0114980_0115106 yeah but why do we want default
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0115106_0115222 just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117710_0117866 yeah but local switch
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117866_0118149 we can not do the levels without trying anything
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118149_0118201 great
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118903_0119072 yeah so if we are getting any useful
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0119572_0120392 but yeah the global inverted false edge gives the non objects basically to the local search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0120772_0120979 well yeah that is always going to be the case in search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0127554_0128257 i mean you can you know the option is to do a search in the way that if you do a global search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128257_0128525 first the first step only return meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128525_0129236 as in not even meetings but the name of the meetings so you know say you want to search for the word language
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129236_0129671 then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129671_0130137 and then you can decide well i want to search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0131846_0131917 definitely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0133484_0134502 there is a yeah in one of the papers they have names oh do they do they like the word
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0134502_0135159 even better understanding
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135159_0135296 that is a working group
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135328_0135540 i wanna
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136130_0136376 so i have put that in already too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136513_0136562 store
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136797_0137361 so yeah again concretely to the startup startup white race we know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0138687_0138799 well actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139654_0139748 yeah how is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139748_0140090 i mean do you think you would have time for that as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0143830_0144030 it would have been like a list of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0146883_0147426 so the general score would that be for the whole of the language
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0147621_0147931 yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148152_0148272 and like yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148571_0149086 so what would the if we had these face topics what would they look like bunch of keywords
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149086_0149296 bunch that is one of these
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149296_0149507 just a list of like three words or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0150892_0151721 because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151721_0151946 because if you just have the segmentation that is great
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151946_0152612 but we can not compare it to the hand annotated you know the hand segmented tool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154848_0154929 you know like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154929_0155000 probably gonna last
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0157347_0157497 yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158504_0158755 yeah that is why i am taking it do we need to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158755_0158866 just looked at
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158866_0158946 what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159488_0159909 sort of but then the main idea was more like to speed it up speed the search up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159909_0160355 because nxt over the whole of the corpus was just not for you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160355_0160440 that way it slowed down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160737_0161085 no but the general inverted vowel
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161085_0161177 it still uses it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161177_0161402 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161402_0161533 that would just be nice extra
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161826_0162209 yeah i was not sure do not forget that in the document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162322_0162464 you are a true youtuber
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162464_0162631 so what i am only into it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163367_0163566 yeah i mean if you have time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163566_0163798 cause i am only gonna do this if i have got time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163798_0164155 because i mean then then it would give you like if you search for work
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164155_0164659 it will give you the meetings but also how often that word occurred in that meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164659_0164887 that would be so useful we could just give you a rank it would
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164944_0164998 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0165287_0165337 yeah i am
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166254_0166691 yeah but it would be useful if how informative that tfidf is an informative score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166691_0167133 yeah if you search for language and you return like you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0167133_0167654 basically all of the meetings you want to see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169068_0169150 why would you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169607_0169964 sunny days
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171103_0171347 i am just kidding
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171347_0171413 because it is a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171413_0171547 the thing is the thing is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0184287_0185068 so come back and stop screaming oh okay i am very unsure about what that should look like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185068_0185739 i mean we run it for the part where you can choose the meeting what kind of information you want to have about the meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185739_0186339 i mean the longer name obviously if there is one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186339_0186624 what the users that spoke
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186624_0186781 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186781_0187146 then that is pretty much the same for the same group
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187463_0187523 a set of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187875_0188443 yeah just to give them an idea a general idea of what there is so they can pick a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190217_0190360 yeah legal browse yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190360_0191168 i want to look at the meeting where so and so spoke of that you know some sort of research group
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191168_0191313 on that first meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191313_0191358 bye
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193761_0193944 keep it war channel
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193944_0194339 because we just want to have a way of you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0194339_0195069 because as soon as they have got loaded their first meeting they can browse through that quite nicely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0196708_0196761 what do you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197378_0197509 how are we going to do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197755_0197983 they can have a site
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198418_0198689 but that would defy the whole point of browsing right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198689_0198979 if you only wanted to look at the top alright call it favourites then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198979_0199684 you can have a favourite just scroll down the list and find your favourite one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0199684_0200295 yeah it is not enough in a way it is not like they come back every day and do the same rousing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0200295_0200898 what was i saying i forget
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0201511_0201565 what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0203619_0203867 so we can sort out a file
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0204433_0204785 no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205023_0205757 i was not going to put any help in there any sort of explanation of how the browser works to be honest
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205757_0205864 i am going to sleep
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207091_0207139 watching
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207616_0207937 but i mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208152_0208271 yeah well it is such you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208271_0208431 even if it is just that two things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0209821_0210117 yeah that all happens through the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210117_0210615 basically either the user knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just clicks on it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210615_0211023 or he does not and then he searches for one that sort of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213265_0213415 i watch you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213415_0213551 inside the search bank
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0215327_0215467 yeah that is what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216096_0216266 yeah that one is about right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216266_0216811 but i am unsure about how to put all the information in there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216811_0217577 but we want all the information about the name the longer i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217577_0217646 well we do not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217863_0218569 maybe if they know the codes and in other in other courses too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0219105_0219240 drop down to the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220084_0220230 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220271_0220456 that is definitely true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0221530_0222119 no no no i am not saying you can pick a user but it should come up with some list
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222119_0222777 but an extended list of the meetings so you know bdr whatever it was called
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222777_0223344 and then it gives you the longer name blah and then it gives you the participants
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223637_0223889 no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223959_0224134 i am just kidding
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224134_0224316 but then is that complicated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224316_0224556 no it is not at all i think not at all too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224556_0224692 it is all done yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224692_0224950 i have not tried that yet but it is good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224950_0225317 oh let us do that then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225317_0225963 yeah i am not sure is that not annoying if you have to get out of the beddy way
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225963_0226273 i was just having a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226273_0226386 i am gonna do that a lot do not i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226386_0226994 to search for a specific user you have to hold your mouse over that one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226994_0227437 yeah that is why you can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0229882_0230290 it would just be nice to have some basic information on yeah or you could have a text box there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230290_0230807 iawn i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i gyd i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230807_0230954 yeah maybe that is the best idea then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230954_0231487 so you have got a drop down menu a search button not search a go button
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0231713_0231788 and then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232000_0232366 some sort of fields which updates dynamically depending on what you have highlighted
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232710_0232798 yeah that is what is for sure
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0233635_0233667 see
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234346_0234496 what does normal actually stand for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234696_0234930 not earlier
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235811_0235971 right right actually it is sick
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235971_0236358 you have got lots of norm something and then knight something and then end something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0236758_0236869 ones in interface and ones that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238062_0238529 and most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you have got to update this jonathan
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238529_0238836 this is unintelligible
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238898_0239158 say that now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0240763_0241021 yeah do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241021_0241212 chocolate bun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241212_0241619 right so anyone else got anything to say
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0242119_0242579 do we want another meeting at the end of the week with penelope
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243033_0243115 yeah it is not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243115_0243612 i mean i think i am going to do quite a bit of work this week so i will have probably more to talk about
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243817_0243898 great
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244842_0244907 if you like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244907_0245123 or we could just go south friday if you have not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0245675_0245756 what what sorry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0247755_0248019 i have got a dog disappointment at ten to two
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0250419_0250544 생각만 하고
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251067_0251106 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251571_0252344 if one is bad for you then no that would only give us like thirty five minutes or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252344_0252592 what what what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252592_0252753 like you know five or six
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0253117_0253282 what is the date like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0254517_0254873 i will write this meeting up and i will send it to him as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0255359_0256031 because she is not here no i mean that she collected oh right oh yeah sorry yeah it is cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256031_0256612 i thought somebody was collecting them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256612_0256834 but then we should probably do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257021_0257501 so can we just repeat briefly what i was speaking about
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257501_0258117 so we have done progress on the speaker characterization who does the speaker characterization
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258117_0258709 we mentioned topic labeling with keywords
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258709_0259136 we discussed if the search should be ranked
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0259136_0259489 and michael do you have anything
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260473_0260541 we did we did
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260848_0261428 well basically not unless you have got time for it at the end
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0261428_0261548 boy that is a dip
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263546_0263744 i think he would how so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263885_0264236 i think it would give you the most relevant result
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0265828_0266434 no but for things like if you search for language then you might have some topics which have
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0266434_0267224 some meetings which have as a topic language they specifically speak about language and they use that word in every sentence
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267224_0267660 and then you have got those that just mention it briefly like once or twice saying
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267660_0268069 you know my language is german or something stupid that you do not really want
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268069_0268282 so you want to distinguish that somehow
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268282_0268379 or not anyway
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268695_0268792 yeah reasonable
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269326_0269623 once it all turns we can just do it in a simple way
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269623_0269691 me
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272028_0272402 yeah just take it off
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272402_0272761 yeah i mean you just do it really simply you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272761_0273228 we will have to talk to brunel about this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0273228_0273333 we are using that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274023_0274217 it does not have to be all intelligent
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274503_0274584 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281142_0281256 пользуясь нами не
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281256_0281671 iawn ond mae yna seventy five o weithiau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283154_0283256 see you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283612_0284081 it would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284081_0284542 but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284934_0285207 you still want to be able to search for the word language
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285410_0285498 answer
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285850_0286022 we will discuss it here on friday
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0002306_0002541 does it squeeze in like that yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0005698_0005937 dat is geen wat zeg je
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0009179_0009353 did i just say the same thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0010398_0010516 so how are we getting along
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017338_0017486 dwi am siarad am hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017486_0018262 the data processing is fine but i do not particularly want to do the gui for it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018262_0018397 no i am not really
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018397_0019186 iawn os ydych chi am wneud hynny dwin meddwl
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019186_0019778 i have created two classes one for the speaker is voice and one for the speaker is voice
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019778_0020295 y cyfranogion ac maer wybodaeth am y ddau yn cael ei gynnwys yn eich un o bwydau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020295_0020877 ac yna maen gwrthwynebu cyflogaethau ac maer cyflogaethau yn cynnwys pob wybodaeth am y cyfarfodydd ar sgwrs
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020877_0021528 y cyfarwyddwr sydd ar y cyfarwyddau y cyfarwyddwr syn siarad ac ynar cyfansoddau syn cael gysylltiad âr cyfarwyddwr
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021528_0021812 so there is two separate classes do you see what i mean okay yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021812_0021965 and they are two different objects
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021965_0022709 and you can record they can write the rights the objects and then you call the objects back and they have those returned objects have all the information that they need
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0022709_0023131 ac yna gallwch chi ddweud y mathau iw gael yn ôl beth bynnag y byddwch chi eisiau iawn ie gweld hynnyn ddiddorol
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023131_0023532 or everything but that is why i wanted to know what is the easiest way to have the data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023891_0024199 yes basically all cataracted
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024199_0024593 and all store those objects so the object files
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024593_0025389 which means that you just call the nlnod constructor and call the load thing and call it that and you can create a list of them or a vector of them or whatever you want to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025463_0025733 and then we will just call them one at a time to populate a window
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025733_0026149 ond dynar hyn rwyn eisiau ei ddweud pa fformat y byddwch chi eisiau ir data ddod yn ôl
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026149_0026783 because it can come back as worse anything
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026783_0026961 it is easiest to just move that metal
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0028239_0028328 yeah i can not hear
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0029102_0030576 so as i can have it so that it returns you a is at the moment the main data structures are hash tables for the meetings that say it is got one that says percent is called percent talk
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030576_0030860 one percent yw ymdrechion a one percent yw cymorth
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030860_0030913 to sell me
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030913_0031695 and then it is got inside it is got a link it is got the speaker is name and then it is got their percentage for that thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0031695_0032375 so it can either come back as a you can have the hashtag or you can have it returned as a vector and it will say noise
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032375_0032689 maen unig yn y string y brif y perfformiad
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032689_0032977 we will say a vector that is cool i do not know whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032977_0033810 you can either have it you can even have it you could have like an embedded vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or what have i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0033810_0034240 what the easiest thing to do without having one in this planet
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0034640_0034795 yeah you get all the way around
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0035962_0036317 see that is the key how do we cannot look at that again
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0036622_0037082 if it is in that format it is speaking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037082_0037710 speaker is the controlling thing not yeah yeah okay yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037768_0038191 felly maer holl hyn wedii gweithredu hefyd y cyflwyniadau sbig
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038191_0038361 yeah that is easy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038361_0038476 so i am gonna call it a music actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038476_0038941 the influences i lived in germany for six months do not know if that had any effect
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038941_0039137 i have spent too much time talking to brits
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039137_0039381 that was a super saute
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039381_0039876 why do not you give a go
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039876_0040167 so then all that is calculated as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040167_0040336 all i have to do is get the dialogue out
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040336_0040428 that is not the thing that we discussed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041434_0041734 so then how is this box populated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041734_0041973 is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042237_0042339 the one present
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042950_0043546 because at the moment i am using there is there are methods that say for the for using for other talks
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0043546_0044062 starts processing it and says like get talk time and you take the name
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044062_0044474 so that we call that and call the meetings method that is a return them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044474_0044823 a byddain ddifrifol ir rhai syn cael eu cymryd yn eithaf cyflym
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044823_0045043 i mean that would
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046352_0046390 yay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046899_0047044 yeah yeah that would be easy as well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047199_0047239 yeah oklahoma
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047239_0047777 felly byddwn in rhoi llawer o ffyrdd syn dod yn ôl un cyfnod ar y cyfnod
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047777_0048030 dynar gwaith mwyafn haws iw wneud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048030_0048200 okay yeah that is fair
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048700_0048948 get to all time i think it is cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049571_0049713 no the store is in object five
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049713_0050140 and then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050140_0050561 only like a one without one k so it is all just pre processed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050561_0050671 ie maen bwysig iawn
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050671_0050993 yn y blynyddoedd maer obiect yn cael rhan or methodoedd oi gael ei hysbytai
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050993_0051116 she has to recreate the objects
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051116_0051305 it is called a load method
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051305_0051769 so what you do is you call a non constructor because if you call the proper constructor for each meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051769_0052052 maen mynd ir ffwrdd a gwneud yr holl brosesau ar gyfer ei hunain o dylunio
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052052_0052355 and then if you call a null constructor
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052355_0052804 then you can call load and you can call load on whatever one or all of them or anything like that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052804_0052879 i do not have a list
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053397_0053633 one object for each meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053683_0053812 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053812_0053941 i wonder if
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054355_0054561 it just tells you who participated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054561_0055144 at the moment it is actually who participated and the amount they participated in percentages and in time as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055391_0055574 yeah it will be a lot easier
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055903_0056071 ie dynar un sydd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056071_0056435 but that would cause a problem with anything that was not an update of a topic
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056752_0056795 i am
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056795_0057141 nid oes gen ir adnoddau iw defnyddio
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057141_0057373 there are some there are some deeper ones actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057373_0057710 a lot of people thank you for the courage
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0058924_0059029 yeah that would be a problem
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059029_0059346 and then you can do a search over the meetings over the objects
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059346_0059579 because that is the thing these are so small
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059579_0060210 gallwch chi roir cyfan i gyd i ddod i mewn ir brofiadau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0060210_0060321 so it does not crash the thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061027_0061353 the global statistics come straight off of that do not they
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061353_0061562 because they are just for the mate mate the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061822_0062225 maer ymgeisydd yn gwybod am yr holl bethau hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0062858_0063016 no no i am not doing that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063289_0063528 yr hyn rydym nin ei moyn
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063528_0063805 i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064279_0064838 no design the game first the problem is if you change the classes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064838_0065272 it the object serial numbers change and you can not reload the object so all the processing has to be done over again
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065272_0065398 and i have not quite finished it yet
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065605_0065949 it would become out of sync and get a bit funny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065949_0066289 if i gave you one if i gave you it now and you worked on it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066289_0066787 and then i changed it and ran the thing again you would not have been able to load the objects back up oh i see
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066787_0067293 and then you would have multiple copies of objects all over the place and it would gettilling i think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0067637_0068265 but if you want to make the picture you can do that without anything what do you mean a picture
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068265_0068459 it changes the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068459_0068569 yeah but it is not going to take
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068569_0068860 yeah that was the plan
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069110_0069420 it will not take very long to get it finished up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069420_0069766 but i think i will need to have done all of this stuff too first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069766_0069924 because otherwise the objects would not be the same
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0070656_0070793 i saw my own virtue
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071077_0071212 i am gonna need to play with
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071212_0071434 well it is finished up with the glove
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089041_0089444 that way it does not crash you try and know your timing while it crashes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089444_0090063 it is a bit dumb if you load up ten different engines simultaneously
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090063_0090305 you can do that climb through
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090305_0090583 right can not do them can not do them if it thinks they are one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090583_0091142 because it is about the amount that each if you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091142_0091801 ond os oes en dweud hynny maen dweud oh iawn rhaid i mi ddweud hynny

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091884_0092582 i am not going to do it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0092582_0093326 it is a nice machine is not it yeah you have spent too much time in front of it have not you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094276_0094351 oh they do not know that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094351_0094424 yeah i have been too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094645_0094693 no pop up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094693_0094753 it was difficult
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099083_0099438 it is an sd browser
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099438_0100082 some speech and some music it does not take too long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0101925_0102381 or a switchboard that comes up that is just a blank form like that with some buttons on yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102381_0102717 live me a meeting live me a search live me something else
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102717_0102797 whistle a tune
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0105945_0106173 stupid nft search

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106774_0107296 you can not the only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those if you have loaded an observation
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0107942_0108922 which does not that way you could use the inverted file search to return a list of meetings and then use one of those to load a search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0108922_0109064 по любо
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109368_0109743 it has to be an observation and even if you go and search the whole corpus from that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109743_0110080 but you have to have it has to start with something for some bizarre reason
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110080_0110675 the engine there is only one there is only one search method to the search engine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110675_0110886 the engine class and he has one such
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0111483_0111596 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118131_0118293 i am definitely going to lie down anyway
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118293_0118486 you can light the dumb one up it does not have any
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0120372_0120433 certain
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121092_0121255 but only gives one at a time anyway does not it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121255_0121388 because otherwise you crush the thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0124992_0125139 it is not too slow though
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125139_0125328 it is not too bad
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125328_0125523 i thought they would never be a team as we are going to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125936 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130214_0130271 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130271_0130817 yeah make it strings for as long as possible and then on your return of things when they actually need to it has to set
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130817_0130921 these type of notions
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132245_0132471 did we think about
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132681_0132824 better names for the meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134197_0134354 how do they do they re translate it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134607_0134666 do this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134666_0134793 okay that is alright then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134793_0134875 이것이 시작
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135077_0135305 well that is a working group
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135332_0135852 i want to see the meetings about david bedlam
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0136433_0136556 okay that is cool that is cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138033_0138314 so who would have the idea
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138314_0138521 i mean the ds
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138521_0138764 document frequencies for each word
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139058_0139344 yeah to do what tiske is talking about you do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139344_0139509 to do the topic later
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0140243_0140790 somebody is done the key so the idea of the ds already with me not to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143073_0143304 how do you do an inverted vowel search without the tfid
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143503_0144032 i think you need to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144032_0144273 the amount that they occur over certain documents
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144273_0145030 basically the amount of the sample df is the document frequencies the amount that each word occurs
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0145030_0146188 term frequency is the amount that it occurs in each document and the other one is the amount it occurs generally
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0146188_0146938 felly y mwyaf o ddynion yn y ddynion ychwanegol yn y cyfnodau arbennig yn y cyfnodaun gyffredinol y mwyaf gwybodol ywr cyfnod
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147303_0147608 the phone you call crossfit corp is still data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147937_0148548 plus a stop list so you remove stuff that does not like that and then there which is going to have a probably basically equal score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148743_0148810 face top
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148964_0149212 bunch of keywords bunch
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149212_0149416 just a list of likes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149416_0149507 sweet words
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149507_0149838 you need to keep those teeth teeth teeth what is the i in tfido
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149838_0149964 inverse goes wrong
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149964_0150187 the term frequency of a stocking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0150429_0150823 i did do it once i do have a java class that does it for something i do not know whether it will work for this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0152722_0153001 also keywords give you a whole new type of search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153001_0153109 see how the keywords are
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153109_0153454 but you could do keyword search could be topic search it could be the same thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153454_0154048 yn hytrach nar cyfeiriadau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0154203_0154315 fudge
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0155341_0156222 i suppose even calculating the what is his face is themselves would be too normal
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0156222_0157189 the easy bit is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole currencies in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157189_0157624 because you do not have to integrate as much yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157973_0158359 no you can do you can do search without tfid if you just can not rank the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0158970_0159494 no no no but is not that what the idea was in the first place to rank the results
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160264_0160488 yeah but that will not slow it down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160488_0160600 ranking you wanna slow down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161107_0161604 it still uses the metaphor but it ranks the results by the higher that would just be a nice extra
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161604_0161818 i thought that was part of it but yeah okay it does not matter
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162242_0162710 no we did not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162977_0163392 but yeah i guess if that is not part of it do not worry about it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0163561_0163750 i am only going to do this if i have got time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164726_0164813 we will just give you a break
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164813_0165282 that was the whole point no no actually because i think it is this is your top one this is your bottom
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166295_0166492 that is it that is how informative it is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166492_0166721 maer tfidf yn sgôr gwybodaeth
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0167959_0168230 it is not a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0168416_0168525 more like what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169308_0169412 that is a compound noun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169412_0169892 sunny days
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169892_0170033 and i will get out of it to you in a video
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170303_0170774 in its most simple form it would do separate rank for each one each turn
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170774_0171163 you could make it more complicated and make it let us not make it more complicated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0171523_0171710 the way we were doing it we were just looking for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172042_0172133 well that is way we are thinking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172133_0172283 and then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0173224_0174008 i guess you just do a sum of the individual tfidf for each term returned
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174008_0174408 and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174408_0174774 and the higher the more informative each term is for each thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174957_0175023 非常之好
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175023_0175228 it is pretty crude anyway it is just looking for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175414_0175908 it is all it is going to do is look for separate oh because then it is going to go into the nxt section
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175908_0176137 or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176137_0176267 yeah yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176267_0176403 so yeah that is less creepy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176403_0176608 um
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177487_0177584 groups
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177584_0178053 yeah without doing any like wordplay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0178851_0179386 actually that is a problem for me too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179386_0179709 that is um yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179709_0179940 but the idea is that gives you an uniformity score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179940_0180210 how you combine those is up to you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180210_0180351 i guess there is lots in there there is a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180351_0180980 if you were there is a whole load about it in manning and shoup
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180980_0181393 they have got a whole chunk about it so just ir is not this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181393_0181581 i am not a signatory
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181581_0181729 there is got to be a good chance of winning
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181729_0181889 if you have not got it it is on cognac
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182495_0182581 видите это
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182581_0182878 hundreds of videos
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0187627_0187906 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188687_0188748 yeah i guess so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188748_0188875 but yeah i guess that is huge
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0197880_0198070 they can have a site preferences
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198070_0198284 kid have a safe trip to san francisco
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198795_0199338 alright call it favourites then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199338_0199448 you can have a fight yes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199722_0200105 yeah it is not enough in relation it is not like they come back every day and do the same
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0201502_0201561 bye
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0204803_0204956 yeah it would be quite good if it has yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0205719_0206009 that is not what i am suggesting i am just saying like these are
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207456_0207592 wow
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207592_0207657 tem isso
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208096_0208257 yeah i will search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208257_0208441 so even if it just said two things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208441_0208990 just said one so one said take me straight to this meeting and have a text box you can enter it or drop down menu
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208990_0209204 and then another one that said search that loaded
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209204_0209467 like a fine specific meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209594_0209856 yeah yeah or one yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211013_0211248 well the other thing to do is just have search as the default
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211248_0211482 maen ddifrin ac maer ffwrdd o siwgr yn ddifrin
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211482_0211798 and that is the interface and you just go from there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212121_0212516 ac yna maer brofysgwr yn dod o hyd i chi i ddweud rhywbeth
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212516_0213348 or the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just and a go button that said take me to this oh i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213348_0213571 so that is the end
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213571_0214400 so the only thing that comes up when you finish is a when you start it is just one window like that and it is got all the search stuff right down there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214400_0214615 so this is your search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214615_0215164 just all here and here is just go to wherever on the go button
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215164_0215514 ac yna o hynny dyma beth ywr gwaith
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215704_0216048 and at the top it says welcome to our browser
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0216813_0216963 good job
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217344_0217656 i won
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217831_0217942 for zits come on
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0218438_0218515 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219079_0219129 1점
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219733_0220248 this is good if you want to search just search if you want to look for one meeting just look at it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220248_0220721 um that is that is true that is oh yes you have two
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220721_0221165 one there but we got two amazing ones this week
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221165_0221415 and you can choose you can go for go or go for the other
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221415_0221477 gehangreifbar
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221477_0221637 nu är det en person
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0223369_0224053 we could do microsoft is style and hold it over it and it pops up a thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224202_0224302 is that complicated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224883_0225023 now something is there so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225023_0225259 oh let us do that then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225832_0226409 get out of the bloody way i am trying to sleep
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227076_0227367 yeah that is annoying
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227367_0227691 that is why you could just have a list of your users then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227691_0227942 and just to just say i want to look for this user
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228029_0228112 for me
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228112_0228471 yn y ddiwedd maer rhan fwyaf or rhai sydd wedi cael y gweithwyr hwnnw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228471_0228698 and then you search then you search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228698_0229192 maybe just leave it just have them leaking names there and do not worry about the speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229192_0229367 if they are doing speakers they are doing such
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229367_0229594 it is not the same it is doing a quick access
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230146_0230659 or you can have a text box there that is got yeah thinking about that updates yeah as you go over them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230659_0230821 then that does not get into it it is like in the way
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0232469_0232617 the full name and then speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233013_0233294 we can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233465_0233505 i think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233723_0233769 and cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233769_0233929 não
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233929_0234025 ymuno âr cyfarfod
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0234538_0234956 i think it is an object model
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235175_0235508 yeah it is you are right it is the right covers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235508_0235796 the night right corpus and then you have got night right elements to this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235796_0236117 you have got lots of numbs
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0236408_0237040 so i think the n ones are interfaces and the night one one of the ways around one is an interface and one is actually an implemented class
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237040_0237498 because you go back enough i think i am the what is his name the wicked
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237498_0237773 the api is all right but there is not a lot of description in it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237773_0237959 no it is very good no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237959_0238103 it tells you what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239098_0239480 so you end up just a set of returns at m text box
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239480_0239560 so okay what is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239583_0240106 it is a implementation of an n text yeahinterface
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240106_0240169 what is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240169_0241198 i would say extended version of it stop it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0242760_0242869 might be useful will not it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0243694_0243809 yeah i should have moved to tokyo
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0244908_0245011 i have
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246177_0246362 just after spt
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246973_0247021 day
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247021_0247144 but that would be right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247460_0247646 video for the little disco
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247646_0247742 yeah that can be fun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248492_0248785 friday morning
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248940_0248994 later
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249148_0249215 i would say i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249215_0249491 maybe i think i am not sure
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0250517_0250815 so we say three oclock and then if there is a serious road mark
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252439_0252628 s aman amlwg tin gwybod dwi ddim yn gwybod
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252792_0252904 my face is better than the phone see
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253216_0253648 it is just straight side side right left left and then um it is just a problem with that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253648_0254165 mae tri or problemau yma fydd y cyfan hwnnwn broblem
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254165_0254342 i do not think that will be not so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254982_0255215 is she collecting them no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255215_0255501 you just sent it to her because she is not here
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255501_0255898 i do not know anything that she collected oh right oh yeah sorry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256003_0256253 it is cool for the gift i feel like i am meeting someone
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256327_0256480 i thought somebody was collecting them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256480_0256648 well that is what i thought you said
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256898_0257262 then we know who is missed them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268426_0268832 yeah that would help for single tabs it would be very useful
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268832_0269419 for multiple terms unless you want to do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0269767_0270631 or you could do it and override it by the you could just ignore the ranking if it does not show up together yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0270631_0270975 or you could have you can penalize it you could just put a way to do the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271207_0271446 yeah you do the nxt shirt so it does not show up together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271446_0271683 either disregard it or put a weighting against it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271683_0271921 so how many pairs you get
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272131_0272336 yeah so then just next
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272981_0273098 yeah i do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274286_0274539 because some things you are going to get a lot of results
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274539_0274873 and if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom when it was actually the most relevant one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274873_0275008 something was also
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276454_0276627 this is nice
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276627_0277014 and um also with something like sunny day
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277014_0277640 the if sunny and day are not mentioned together a lot but sunny types of questions once
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277640_0277942 that its term will be low and will push down the other one if you combine them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277942_0278075 we just add them together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279124_0279167 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279167_0279738 but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something is an amazing highly ranked thing from tfivf
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279738_0280798 it could just be ignored because it falls off the bottom of the i am assuming you return all results for all say you type language and it returns seventy five meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281067_0281627 i do not know what wayne is doing but there are seventy five meetings is there really
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281627_0281677 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281996_0282399 so yeah if you return seventy five where do you stop
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282399_0282559 how do you rank them or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282559_0283107 it says twenty even if it says twenty do you cut it for ten d right and d that is true okay what is the threshold
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283107_0283196 to live with it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283425_0283566 dat is gewoon mooi
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283566_0283669 where did i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287489_0287536 is that it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287733_0287945 done
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0288070_0288203 i timed off already
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0004764_0005099 in the comments
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0005099_0005160 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0006711_0006820 끝
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0010769_0011623 one thing that i was wondering is there standard control that you use to connect the different things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0011623_0012020 like you are in the topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012020_0012646 is there a particular type of control like is there one of these nxt or sorry night controls
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012646_0012722 bye
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0015854_0016228 you have not had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016228_0016669 like other topics or what we are going to do in for speaker i guess in all the restrooms
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016669_0016708 why not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016779_0017338 okay um when we talk about speaker characterization how are we accessing the list of speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026808_0026979 it is not that much
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026979_0027329 like when he was talking about like having architecture that things are going to plug into
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027329_0027798 i mean so that things are all modular i mean it would be a good idea if we used that same idea for anything else
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027798_0027954 for what else we are doing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027954_0028342 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0028342_0028849 i mean search results are thrown in a predictable thing with a name certain properties or listed properties of that term
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0033745_0033849 what am i what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034053_0034342 how you gonna use the plumber
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034378_0034788 it is just a matter of deciding what would be easiest yeah exactly all the way around
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049224_0049723 so each time are you going straight to the xml files for the information no it is stored as an object file
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049723_0049757 press is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049757_0049850 this is a lot of fun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049850_0049965 i hope there is a nice day
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049965_0050004 thank you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050258_0050422 yn ddiweddarach
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050422_0050663 so it is all just pre processed yes it is all pre processed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051309_0051345 so what you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051959_0052044 images right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0052811_0053116 this is a list is it for the entire corpus
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053116_0053476 or is it just like individual ones like one object for one object which means
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053476_0053540 income
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053540_0053686 i am a twink
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053919_0054132 i wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we are doing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054132_0054324 huh
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054355_0054385 it is just a matter of time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054871_0054911 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0056609_0057022 or just return a null or a no it is been specified
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0060208_0060258 das
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071484_0071909 actually i can upload my stuff as well i just have to make one change to your phone
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071909_0072240 just to load this one instead of the default all right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0072240_0072566 so it is too much for her yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073070_0073163 what do you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073336_0073698 well yeah just the one thing that is like the action for loading up the search thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074114_0074311 i will be
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074427_0074693 i do it in my directory just do it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074876_0075176 i have a copy yes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075176_0075245 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075245_0075906 but i will yeah i was going to update that one just you know it just makes sense that well just tell us when because i usually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076114_0076300 and then update

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076744_0076902 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076902_0077102 i will just make that one moment
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077311_0077597 yeah because like i said two lines of code yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077597_0078132 and then you can play
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078132_0078233 there is not much to the end
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078233_0078625 have to get better results like better
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078938_0079543 and just to wiring the topics and do summaries
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0079543_0080115 i mean the highlighting stuff well yeah i like that as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080115_0080211 soon
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080297_0080874 and just want to find what kind of objects those were for the other ones
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080874_0081304 so it goes in our hands
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0082326_0082359 fun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085593_0085681 okay sounds good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085892_0086548 okay there is a few more things to do with that and then once we know it gets the index
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086548_0086820 so then that is gonna be kind of fun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086820_0087170 i am just wondering if you had to well the way you are doing i was gonna ask if the way you were doing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087170_0087588 you were loading a new corpus each time for each meeting but you were doing the object
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087588_0088289 so you do not need to just because if we if we do have like the inverted search says that there is you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0088289_0089001 ten documents are we going to have to load each of these ten corporal just to do the individual next t strip
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0089380_0089533 it is a big problem
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090150_0090373 fine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090373_0090406 need them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090860_0091294 you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine but if you do not then it will not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091294_0091408 that is insane
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091738_0092049 otherwise the guy is all new
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0093795_0093898 okay so that ai not now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099112_0099725 it is an sd browser some speech and some music
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099725_0099959 oh princess
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099959_0100154 it does not take too long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100154_0100590 we have to while we are debugging
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100590_0100987 but it was something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103440_0103544 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103783_0103949 and that would be good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104515_0104905 i was just going to ask if we should assume that they will want to load a meeting first but not necessarily
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104905_0105239 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0105765_0105892 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0106555_0106792 well we can put that in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107270_0107714 i could probably even that should not be too hard to put a chuck in there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107714_0107884 and if it has not loaded then force him to load it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111723_0111938 unless they know what me to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111938_0112083 well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0113546_0114127 or well the things i mean just be looking for a word and you know looking if it shows up at ten different meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114127_0114868 then at that point they will probably want to like do we want to like if it by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114868_0114978 in our culture
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115184_0115431 well i am like to a lot of like the thing is i think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115580_0116003 like when it loads up it will load up the transcript window and whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116003_0116206 right now i think just the topic ones
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116206_0116826 although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116826_0117456 so i am just thinking if it is kind of like you are saying you have to have a non object
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117456_0117835 i mean before you do the search at all yeah the local search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117876_0117953 candle levels
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117953_0118007 that is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118453_0118825 yeah but the global one feeds into the local
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118825_0119318 so if we are getting any useful data it is going to be doing a search on each of those files
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0119318_0119664 so it is going to be loading up each of those at a time to get the data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0120470_0120896 but it could be time consuming like if there are ten documents that have to be consumed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121424_0121743 um yeah well i am just thinking of some way we could you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121743_0122317 i will just cache the results in a nice little format that will make things a bit easier
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0122317_0123043 but the thing is i mean if we have got that then it is going to be needing really to load the entire corpus for that meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123043_0123539 if it is trying to show us where those were if it is trying to highlight those in the text transcript or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123539_0123775 and we are going to have to have all that other data in them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123775_0124048 so each time we move the search window and we have like you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124048_0124307 ten different meetings the word wireless comes up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124307_0124688 go to meeting one and it has to reload the non object
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124688_0124836 next one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124836_0125272 yeah it is not too bad
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125272_0125338 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125539_0126076 it always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least yeah lately it is just loading it up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126076_0126392 tested trash monkey shut down voila
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126392_0126975 yeah so just sort of based on that as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126975_0127464 but if it does not take that long each time then that should be alright
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0128741_0128774 karen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0129973_0130006 it is what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0130824_0131060 i do not think he is having a chance
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131060_0131406 and that way they know specifically which meaning it is yeah that will save the time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131406_0131880 because i am sure they do not want to have the extra loading time either they can avoid it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131880_0132180 so yeah where they can check mark against the ones they want to check
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0132988_0133108 i think they were in the text
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0133108_0133838 we can probably do that ourselves and just sort of bdb you know just do a there is a yeah in one of the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134088_0134278 oh the day to day
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134278_0134441 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134441_0134649 like the work that it is part of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134767_0134902 i probably just use that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135309_0135394 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135999_0136107 i think that is accurate
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0138712_0139019 you actually need the frequencies
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139480_0139554 i will write that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139574_0139634 thank you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140160_0140436 well the thing is if it is being done if somebody is done the keywords
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140755_0141096 there is a class she is trying to get to work on friday
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141096_0141729 they did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141729_0142205 but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff but the last i heard it was not working
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142205_0142825 she was going to look at more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142825_0143125 but if we need the if we do need the frequencies i will do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143368_0143467 um i do not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143784_0144054 well it would have been like a list of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0144389_0144452 what is the sample
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147353_0147533 cool cross the corpus the data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147533_0147825 so yeah probably a terrible bit
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147825_0148187 plus y stop list so you remove stuff that does not work
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0149632_0149922 what is the i in tfidf inverse
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0150668_0150690 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158468_0158525 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158525_0158712 yeah that is why i am taking it do we need to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158712_0159014 i mean we are just looking oh for your stuff i guess
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0159014_0159111 know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0161982_0162591 i do not think we have that in the document true no we did not true so what it is only in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162649_0162718 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162718_0162746 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0163504_0163648 yeah she is only gonna do this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0164960_0165013 well you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165013_0165350 actually because i think it is so neat this is your top one this is your bottom yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165350_0165897 but the thing is we are just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they are looking for a particular term or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165897_0166317 they just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and want to see it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0167571_0168186 but if it is like a two word term does a tf idf have a like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168186_0168529 it is not a compound noun it is just two words together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168529_0168814 um and i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168814_0168924 i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168924_0169280 to something like edinburgh university
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169446_0169675 well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169675_0169803 sunny days
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169803_0169843 i will tell you that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0170922_0171222 let us not make it more complicated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171385_0171739 because the thing is the thing is that the way we were doing it we were just looking for the words
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171739_0172055 period each word in the in the index
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172055_0172193 well that is the way we were thinking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172193_0172508 and then it is just saying were these two words in any of these documents
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172508_0173238 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0175914_0176170 or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176170_0176242 let us
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176617_0176931 i am just wondering if it is going to give us something cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176931_0177652 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0177957_0178333 or also like do wild cards work for something like that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178333_0178889 so if you are looking for a wireless wired wire blah blah blah you do wire with a star yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178889_0179192 actually that is a problem for me too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179192_0179324 so or
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179324_0179364 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179683_0179870 the idea is that you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180329_0180467 try it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180467_0180583 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180583_0180653 weird
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181036_0181057 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181454_0181530 our entry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181880_0182342 yeah i have got somewhere
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182591_0182876 hundreds of videos
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182876_0183163 do the pdf switch it to postscript switch it back to pdf
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183580_0183640 huh
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183640_0183894 okay that is okay good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0184522_0184819 oh okay what sort of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0186835_0186923 for date
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0187258_0187797 for the most part i mean there will be a set of people that do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188405_0188759 search for stuff or start working yeah i guess i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188759_0189152 yeah i guess that is huge or browse ok like search browse
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189349_0189594 like if you are looking for something specific is that what you are thinking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189594_0190013 like if they if they know exactly where they want to go they want to go to you know that meeting on december third
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190401 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0191972_0192304 browse by meeting browse by mom browse by speaker
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192304_0192679 no i am just thinking of different ways we can do that like different buttons on the top
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192679_0193086 like if they are looking for a particular person particular working group particular whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193086_0193671 and we just we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193671_0193905 where we could keep it more general
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195177_0195627 yeah but i am just thinking like initially when they load up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195627_0195904 what are the range of things that they would want to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195904_0196265 like if they are part of x working group they will want to get in there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196265_0196481 do we want to save preferences
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196786_0197287 well if they are part of bdb working group they are going to want to look at the bdb ones and some default to that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197287_0197384 bye
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197610_0198058 based on what they did the last time they can have a site preferences
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199005_0199280 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199424_0199910 yeah it is not enough in relation is it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200239_0200457 what was that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200457_0200585 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200585_0200849 i forget
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200922_0201065 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201065_0201541 well no i am just getting back to sort of what could be on the startup screen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201541_0201912 like there is just a range of things we could do we could have like search browse options
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201912_0202445 i dunno just playing around with ideas
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0202445_0203527 and then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say oh if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203527_0203630 i am andrew dispel
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203630_0203968 so we can sort of guide them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203968_0204271 it is just like hey my task is to do this and there is a button
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204271_0204383 perfect
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204383_0204496 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204496_0204529 mbc 뉴스 김재경입니다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204529_0204737 i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205682_0205884 no that is not what i am suggesting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205884_0206558 so i am just saying like these are just like a lot of programs will kind of lame programs do have that sort of thing first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0206558_0207407 just because they do not want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the program
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207407_0207598 so yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207992_0208211 probably research says yeah let us say
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209137_0209471 i just instantly message like a fine specific meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209471_0209691 yeah that is an easy one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0210971_0211077 such as protean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217577_0217753 well we do not actually have usernames do we
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217753_0218050 going through all these codes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218519_0218657 in a case like that we do want to drop down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218657_0218789 we do not want them to type them do we
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219359_0219525 and allow multiple
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219563_0219865 okay you are just looking for one specific
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0221052_0221142 amazing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0224492_0224581 dat betoelt het
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0227069_0227251 yeah that is in the way
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230548_0230731 you go over there then that does not get any
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230731_0230930 yeah maybe that is the best idea
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234609_0234815 object model
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234815_0235146 i think in that case it is the right corpus
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235146_0235208 so no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235208_0235417 yeah it is you are right it is the right covers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0236358_0236513 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0239953_0240051 i hate these
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240638_0240914 no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240914_0240980 definitely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0241644_0241921 well not really just going to keep on going
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0242621_0243025 might be useful would not it yeah like friday afternoons
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0243877_0244106 then we will not have to have the meeting with steve on tuesday
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244106_0244159 portal
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244241_0244628 so do we want to arrange this get this one earlier
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244628_0244888 three
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245098_0245167 that is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245587_0245678 yeah sure
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246596_0246706 possibly i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246706_0246996 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246996_0247596 yeah that would be all right well i do not know because it is the lab and try and get some work done
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248060_0248216 okay right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248216_0248298 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248688_0248940 three oclock
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248940_0249187 or you want to get
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249187_0249353 maybe i do i am not sure
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249353_0249436 i think i see a camera
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249767_0249998 i think she is got a class at eleven
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249998_0250371 with all that class one   three with subclass twelve
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250371_0250565 shall we say
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250776_0250894 or if we could try
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250894_0251001 we could try shortly after
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251001_0251148 yeah well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251148_0251339 well it would not be a long meeting then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251339_0251379 for you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251379_0251707 would you wanna no probably not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251707_0251921 if one is bad for you then we will not okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252235_0252278 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252855_0252933 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259469_0259873 those are just sort of the basic implementation stuff that i was remembering
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259873_0260094 but when she before
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260094_0260376 good question
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260376_0260692 did we decide whether to be ranked
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260798_0260979 well basically
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0261426_0262136 well i kind of think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262136_0262837 just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document it is not really getting them together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262837_0263091 like if someone is looking for a particular term
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263091_0263526 i do not know just do not know if it would bring us that much
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263668_0263708 awesome
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264093_0264561 be the most relevant result if they are looking for like i say a sunny day and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264561_0264931 sunny shows up in this document day shows up with the map together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264931_0265179 or if there are two
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0265179_0265811 it just does not you are looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0268462_0268812 in that sense for single tabs it would be very easy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0269500_0269766 it is just too simple
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270757_0270985 you could just put a white to do the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270985_0271210 she has still to do the nxt shirt trim
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271210_0271367 yeah you do the nxt shirt so it does not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271367_0271506 up together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271599_0271853 waiting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271853_0272207 well it would not show up on the search results if it did not exist
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0272813_0273225 we will have to talk to her about this yeah see how she is doing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0273225_0273883 if we are using that i mean it does make sense for that but actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274305_0274557 some things you are going to get a lot of results for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274879_0275247 i think it is also i mean if it is my own yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275247_0275434 yeah okay i will search him
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275434_0275852 i think we could actually put that like on the list of meetings that get returned
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275852_0276514 there are fifteen meetings languages in and it is going to show you those and rank them as to which is the highest
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0276514_0276625 so okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278040_0278313 the things i mean that will be exactly how we are doing it now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278313_0278617 like we are just looking for the two words separately see if they exist in the same document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278617_0278907 and if they do then there is a possibility that they occur together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278907_0279111 and then we do the annexation on that document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0279318_0279373 so if
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280821_0280998 we will break down and start doing it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280998_0281269 i do not know what else to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281269_0281344 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281344_0281597 but there are seventy five meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281597_0281750 yeah yeah wow
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0282891_0282954 no it is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0283224_0283732 would be useful as well for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0287628_0287707 catch
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0002063_0002511 and we have to get every time we are doing some films
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0004128_0004707 oh it is me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0006734_0007677 i do not know i am dropping it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0007677_0008425 så måske vil jeg ikke have sat det her under
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0008425_0008509 for the owner
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0011420_0012024 no that is just summary no no i will do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012024_0012207 what
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012207_0012328 i am

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0095446_0096325 we have to remember to include that in our evaluation how did the game improve your browsing experience
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0099902_0100259 i guess that is why we have separate speech lab
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0100305_0100661 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0101446_0102253 i am running some troubles with the indexing but i found another package instead of writing it from scratch
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0102253_0102750 because of the fall i do not know just know that i have not pulled around it much
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0103034_0103425 we will see what happens in the next few days

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108360_0109058 yeah that is right it feels like it is a drama it is a drama
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0109058_0109200 practical job
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0114513_0115039 i thought we said i thought we changed it to the panther song
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0115201_0115311 is thought

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154557_0154768 end of lectures
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0155606_0155728 oh it is actually twenty four
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160131_0160714 did he say anything about like what he expects of the final report and stuff
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160714_0160855 like no they were
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162302_0162513 although it is typically pretty straightforward
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162725_0162808 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0163258_0164252 i mean we have interim report of seven pages and that is we can seven pages yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164252_0164518 we could probably just expand that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164660_0164909 i mean a lot of it is going to be the same thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165229_0165633 and then i mean write about the evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165633_0165800 yeah that could be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165915_0166112 i do not think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166261_0166473 please tell me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166682_0166722 hmm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0189309_0189397 and four
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0189511_0189605 you can just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0198555_0199395 it should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries from using that text extractor thingy
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0199631_0199794 again it is just two topics
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200307_0200435 thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200435_0200738 can you make on
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0202466_0202569 très flippant
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0202681_0202785 to have for a startup

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025312_0025661 i know they live there but i had even more stuff there yesterday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0026400_0026858 what did we actually do without this
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0027366_0027487 i am
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028244_0028456 has anyone had time to play with it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028841_0028914 comments
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0030210_0030251 월급이
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031013_0031119 my eyes were like
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031119_0031314 does not really do anything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031314_0031602 the thing is that yeah there is as i said a while ago
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031602_0032314 there is still this one error which is a bug in nxt and that always generates these
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032314_0032693 i think when you left click or right click or something i can not remember now
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032835_0033593 but if it is a real error then it stops i did not discover any of those
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035556_0035682 yeah we good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035682_0036229 is there any comments you have about just like wording or some sort of minor things
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0036931_0037073 a lot of this java stuff
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037073_0037439 at the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty at all
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037439_0038026 but i would make them a bit nicer if i had more time but at the moment it does not look like that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0038026_0038251 no it is not it is not it is not the top
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0039715_0040133 that took me so long to do this play style
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040229_0040610 so i am quite glad that it looks nice on one row and all this kind of thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040826_0040967 no this is just yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043111_0043280 cards
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043872_0044186 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0044186_0045922 i tried five times like a couple of times same same really speed it up try that a few times yeah i started using your um the speaker i do not know if you have seen that i saw that yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046694_0046770 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046770_0046985 but it is good your stuff is really good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046985_0047241 it is got a good interface and easy to use
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0047241_0047277 nice
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050087_0050345 so i will go to that and then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050983_0051183 cause when they say uh huh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051521_0051791 it is kind of boring
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051791_0051870 it is very
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0052391_0052733 is that a sleep thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0053528_0054020 so which you know maybe you can suggest a few that would be interesting to list
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054020_0054141 like
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054999_0055042 for example
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059149_0059684 i mean do we care i do not know it does not really matter
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059782_0060580 but it would be difficult if in the speaker characterization window we had a heading you know top five dialogue acts
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0060580_0061211 and then the little brackets but they are not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0062130_0062233 for the speaker
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063316_0063513 no i would not yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063921_0064001 thumbs up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064597_0064749 top five this meeting and then the rest is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064997_0065404 yeah just do top five both local and global and then have another
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0065511_0066137 but then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0067354_0067828 vi får lavet en ny samling
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068535_0068751 yeah so that is what is big in capitalisation is not it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068933_0068999 nice to wine bowl
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0070291_0071373 so is this percentage then if you say like joke for this speaker is percentage
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0071373_0072234 i do not know twenty is that the what percentage of his speech is joke or what percentage of the jokes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0072390_0072533 in the meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0076024_0076748 well that is a bad pun too yeah i mean just keep it simple
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079148_0079241 you will
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079655_0079701 it is so good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0080298_0080635 yeah i was thinking that it sort of turned out that way a bit did not it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081393_0081435 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081435_0081503 after
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081701_0081788 pick him up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0083604_0084156 i have one little question that i reckon we should have a little icon for on the browser
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084458_0084804 well no oh i know you yeah the top left
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084804_0085504 the men they have got an x which is you know nxt and it is sort of a bit cheeky to use that yeah it would be silly yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0085748_0086228 no you want something original
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086228_0086606 what do you suggest
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086606_0086931 the only thing i could think of was an m yeah i know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0087488_0088107 where have i seen that before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089655_0089703 cute
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089864_0090401 i mean it is tiny so we can not really put more than one character really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0090996_0091065 video
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092316_0092511 well if you find anything then send it to me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092623_0092786 otherwise i will make up some ends
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093222_0093399 it is really good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093399_0093461 it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094007_0094383 yeah yeah i know how to put it there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094383_0094598 but i will have to import it somehow
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094598_0094669 i am not going to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094912_0095078 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0096698_0096891 can i even
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0097278_0097652 love to so then meet in here can we get sound on these machines no that is broken
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0098936_0099810 if the sound card is registered to your name which it usually is not and you have to reboot and sometimes it still does not work
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0109184_0109734 i like that it is an nxt package
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110371_0110848 i mean sometimes i have methods that do not have any explanation to them at all
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110848_0111427 i think it was like right i will try this then and see what it does
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0114594_0114697 i thought we said
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116565_0116699 like and subscribe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116932_0117417 well that is the problem because steve has not given us any detail on the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118045_0118119 that is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118486_0118681 i am too actually tired
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118798_0118957 just brainstorm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119308_0119597 the thing is yeah we had the deadline last friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119597_0120310 but we will not be able to do an evaluation during the weekend anyway so i think we could set monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0120589_0120727 and that would give us the a grade
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124504_0124539 mbc 뉴스 김지경입니다
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124539_0124631 i think that is why we are here
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125696_0125814 push it off
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125814_0126195 but at the end we will say you never gave us any tests or anything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126439_0126709 well sort of that is how i understand it he said he would try
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126709_0126933 he would make something up okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126933_0127272 yeah find some people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0127272_0127400 선생님이 계실게요
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0128207_0129005 i think if we do not get anything from him then we should just do our friends basically
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0129539_0129786 more than your friend actually
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130084_0130181 it is not gonna take long
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130181_0130389 and you are going to be hot now
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0131849_0132005 like highly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132005_0132102 i think we will be alright
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132203_0132302 we will have to be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0133368_0133554 i was thinking of like ten
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135493_0135700 how can you get a range of people if you have three
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135848_0136057 that is it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137042_0137183 maybe we should just have two
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137207_0137686 my bad my microphone
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0138306_0139183 another thing we have the presentation in one and a half weeks or something whatever it is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139183_0139283 nearly two weeks
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139470_0139766 oh it is true yeah it is two weeks then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139766_0140033 do we have to have done the evaluation by then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141001_0141075 to the person
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141075_0141211 twenty fourth
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141211_0141299 yes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141791_0141925 is that a good friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0142694_0142974 well i am sure on the website it says thursday yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0143656_0144109 well you know the question is do we need the evaluation for the presentation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144673_0144807 we should definitely ask him
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144807_0144937 because if not then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0146055_0146174 yeah you might be right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0147522_0147750 because we need to write a presentation as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148526_0148668 exactly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148668_0148771 it is like
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0149119_0149585 well i am not free after this monday but i am free like after oh the next one okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0150257_0150782 i mean i am not even worried about it because i do not have anything after the active part
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0151069_0151276 but that is in on the eighteenth
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0152163_0152341 so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0155338_0155536 i just fancy writing him an email
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0156342_0156473 that yep
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157162_0157354 but it is still important
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157354_0157436 part of the demonstration
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157584_0157793 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157793_0158247 i mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation in the first place
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158247_0158353 and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158660_0158735 what was the other one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158872_0159599 basically how is how is it going with your evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0159599_0160018 have you got people you hate or else what are you thinking when
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0161530_0161870 did we know did he ever say how long it was supposed to be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162181_0162365 to win power
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162784_0162869 but we can write a lot
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162869_0163120 i mean i think we should write everything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0164008_0164164 so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0165590_0165676 yeah we can not skip
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0166237_0166299 actually
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167052_0167284 so do you want to write him an email then sure

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0177559_0178451 yeah maybe you want to do left handed yeah one left click highlights the result in whatever you have got open
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178805_0178847 together
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178969_0179185 various like yeah from the topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0179185_0179812 usually one left click it highlights it cross highlights everything i think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181008_0181185 i do not know why that is difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181679_0181767 well they each learn a phrase
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182347_0182533 and stick a bow
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182533_0182797 because the transcription window does cross highlighting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182924_0183290 in a very awkward way because he has to find the topic first
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183290_0183584 and that was about my pain
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183744_0184682 and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0184682_0185363 and that works when you left double click on a topic on a meeting sorry then it loads it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185470_0185530 so you could
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185645_0185769 you could take that for loading
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185971_0186525 so if we have that the same on this one at least that you if you double left click that loads
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187847_0187994 highlights yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187994_0188550 i mean obviously highlights whatever you have clicked on here oh just that um but also highlights
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0188848_0188969 actually it is difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0189484_0190231 because you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be well i suppose if you have a local search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190231_0190333 then you could cross eye line
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190932_0191506 because if you get back several different meetings here and you have only got one meeting open then you can not cross out anything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0193267_0193395 watch this
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0194506_0194561 so um
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0195663_0195780 well what is the meaning
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0196279_0197295 well in any case if you left click on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open then it should cross highlight yes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0197295_0197410 if not you can not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200617_0200677 can you make a 
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200781_0201493 is it very difficult to make another gui but only for a global search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0201930_0202490 just just take that away the local checkbox
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202490_0202650 because they are not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202772_0202979 yeah because in the start screen you can not have it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203231_0203342 yeah we do make that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203342_0203575 that would be handy
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203575_0203798 everything else can just stay the same you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203798_0204134 and finally you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbox
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0204584_0204934 radio bug
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0216087_0216123 are we done
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007053_0007312 same face
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007312_0007390 i am fine
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0011917_0012147 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0017470_0017772 it is just seems a little chaos
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0019495_0019601 seems unlikely
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0020970_0021307 i think i saw that and i think it is a good point
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0022410_0023001 it does not have anything in it oh really it does it has about three lines of xml yeah that is right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023214_0023273 what is that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023775_0024183 it just seems to be occupying the whole room
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024183_0024302 it is alright it does not matter
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024302_0024419 this
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024562_0025175 i had lots of stuff in there yesterday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025175_0025310 it is just a weird object
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025310_0025643 oh no they live there but i had even more stuff there yesterday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025643_0025952 i was unzipping all these crazy huge things that were in the world
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025952_0026083 i needed them they were for this stage
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0026083_0026667 it is alright about that i was recording on that what did you actually do to it it is huge
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027076_0027357 yeah yeah i think there is about eight gigs on there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027357_0027476 so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027476_0027982 it is just much bigger than all of our home though it is just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028614_0028945 i will play a bit yes play a comment
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028945_0029123 no it is good really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029123_0029191 yeah that is it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029599_0030007 it generated a lot of exceptions in the background
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0030007_0030205 but they did not cause any problems
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033280_0033537 yeah i did not discover any of those yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033537_0033821 i think i am gonna leave
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033821_0034404 i have fronted it to see if it would break but it did not break too i did not play that long but it seemed alright really yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034404_0034674 and the startup screen is kind of good it looks all right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034674_0034783 it is okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036267_0036363 no that is why
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036363_0036835 the only thing is that the start up screen is not too pretty
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036835_0037111 part of this job is fun
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038021_0038352 no it is not it is not it is not the top part
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038566_0038773 i think it looked better on windows as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038773_0039024 because java uses the native windows does not it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0039343_0039428 actually can we
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0040098_0040140 to the d
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0041480_0041897 well the um the um speak characterization is finished
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042029_0042437 i have not updated all those objects for us yet though because it takes ages on these computers
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042437_0042884 it is faster for some bizarre reason if i log in at home and then run the code
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042884_0043116 it runs it much faster than air by doing it here
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043276_0043666 wait that is half an hour to sit in the lab and wait half an hour
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043889_0044535 i have done some flip
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0044535_0044929 you really speed it up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045839_0045916 i see that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045916_0046646 so that it tells you what speakers are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0046646_0046715 нет
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047380_0047894 the dialogue ads are all done and they are quite amusing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047894_0048815 but some of them some of the thing actually what i wanted to talk about that a little bit was um there are some that occur all the time that i just and i do not know how interesting there are
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0048815_0049448 so the first one statement is that it will i have removed it because it was like everything is prefixed by statement
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0049448_0050088 every single dialogue act starts with a statement so everybody is top dialogue act is a statement
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050088_0050129 quote of the day
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050245_0050314 so i will go into that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050314_0050682 and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050682_0050792 i do not know what that means
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050792_0050952 who knows what was it back channel
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051210_0051277 is that what that means
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051277_0051370 i will keep building
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051370_0051605 and then the other
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051884_0051947 some people do not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051947_0052095 there are some people who do not do that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052095_0052411 yeah you can see that they have done it and it is the bottom of their list
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052523_0052876 yeah i know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052876_0053288 some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0053288_0053572 um
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054120_0054797 that is the thing i wanted to know whether or not we because at the moment you can get there is a method that will just give you the top five or the top x
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054797_0055107 so you give it a number it will give you the top whatever for each person
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0055107_0056001 and then each meeting knows about all the different dialogue acts for each person in the meeting and the amount that that occurred
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056001_0056677 and we will give you that in top order as well or you can just search for each specific dialogue act
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056677_0057267 but you have to search on in b is and ks rather than real words
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057267_0057447 but i can change that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057447_0057616 so i do not know what we want to display
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057616_0057967 i am asking you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0058705_0058934 all is a lot all is like twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0059098_0059276 i am dying me too i do me too
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061270_0061732 i think we should have the global top five because each speaker is got a top whatever
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061732_0062279 so just say one of the boxes just explains this is my top five dial decks for the speaker for the speaker
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0062279_0062926 and then in the meeting you have what you can either have the most commonly occurring ones or you can have a list of each speaker is top dynabits
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063063_0063146 either of those would they
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063146_0063342 no
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063541_0063654 well you could have no you do not need that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063654_0063991 so he is because he is because it is a speaker window the speaker character realization when it comes up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063991_0064404 so you have got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0064404_0064962 and then the top five in global top five this meeting and then the rest is obvious is not it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066048_0066086 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066256_0066714 but often the interesting ones do not occur things like joke do not occur very often
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066714_0067023 well they do sometimes but they are not that common
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067023_0067170 one guy has top five chances
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067170_0067229 one of his tokens
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067229_0067328 he is an undergrad
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067328_0067396 thanks floppy
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067426_0068442 this is good for browsing though it is perfect i mean that is exactly what we wanted here in the beginning
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0068558_0068633 you have taken it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069233_0069679 it is taking me to the next joke
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069860_0070409 that would be quite good would not it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0072044_0072846 what percentage of the dialogue acts that he makes are jokes in the meeting and globally separately
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073056_0073347 i think most things are coded with it is all okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073347_0073526 a lot of them were kind of in the zed which means like labels
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073526_0073733 so i just ignored that a little
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073733_0073790 accessible
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073946_0074059 and statement which is boring
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074059_0074781 and also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something so if i quote a joke to you they separate that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074781_0075165 so they put they put the the dialogue x and they put a double a colon and they put that aside
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075165_0075639 iawn dwi wedi gwblhau unrhyw ddeunydd or materion
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075639_0075772 yeah somebody else is job
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075772_0076025 so you have to be original about your material
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0076025_0076404 i thought it was fat curds too
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077423_0077500 yeah that is what got me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077500_0077559 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077673_0078155 i just finished there might be some questions
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078155_0078195 for remembering
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078195_0078339 but i think he is pretty nice he played it well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078339_0078429 so i will do that tonight
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078429_0078493 just put it up there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078493_0078683 so you can start using that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0080941_0081261 no it is just something called meeting and speaker oh okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081261_0081362 i can change it if you want
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081863_0082071 put it in a package
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082181_0082258 i hate you bud
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082410_0082679 it does not seem to make any difference i have never ever used jargon packages
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082679_0082941 yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082941_0083101 maybe it is in the same directory it works

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0090954_0091434 what do you think we would be doing msc is in informatics and we would just be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0091434_0092082 i will check to see if i can find any
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093351_0093450 it is really easy
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093450_0094076 you do it in one of the whatever the main window is you do set gear for some set set set
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094076_0094130 yay i 
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094723_0094995 ie rwyn credu y byddwch chin dal iw ddod or ffurf mewn cyfnodau hynny
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095198_0095345 yeah yeah just click it correct
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095345_0095469 yeah me too
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0096862_0097042 it even has some sound when it comes on
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097042_0097588 love to so the beat gets out on these machines
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097588_0097750 no that is rubbish
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097750_0097841 let us do it again
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0098317_0098701 no but i think if you put headphones in it will just play just normally

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0108805_0109267 it is a job it is a job practical job
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0109598_0109694 tools
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0110835_0110927 yeah i think it was
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111060_0111155 すごいだろ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111299_0112231 this was finally generated by going to generate java doc and just went and split it all out and then they brought it to it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112554_0112756 it is good to know what methods are there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112756_0112904 without having to look at the source code
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112904_0112944 you know it is just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0113268_0113370 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114442_0114592 진짜 다행이거든요
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114592_0114681 i thought we said
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124630_0124769 so we did not have time for the meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124769_0124899 maybe it is just the diet
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125011_0125070 send me an email
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125070_0125180 i probably will not do it anymore
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126155_0126235 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126563_0126708 he said he would try
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0132751_0132990 how am i giving a video a try and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133265_0133358 really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133528_0133914 no it is gonna take forever and then you have got to analyse the results
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133914_0134088 like the thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0135705_0136941 yeah one computer scientist and one dude off the street yeah one game one sportswoman and one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0137100_0137490 i should just have two
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139417_0139544 oh it is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139544_0139677 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140616_0140712 that is not pretty
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140712_0140962 twenty fifth of july
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141119_0141248 twenty fourth yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141940_0142114 dude that is so funny oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145149_0145491 we should try and have it done by then anyway
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145491_0145868 otherwise it was totally getting tight
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146247_0146629 we should aim to be finished by monday this monday coming
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146629_0146885 a week no yeah well basically for tuesday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146885_0147214 start the evaluation pretty much right away and then go
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147364_0147545 yeah and then get
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147696_0147872 we still write the report and everything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147872_0147950 treat its functions
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150022_0150518 that is easy compared to my lips there i mean i am not even breathing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150813_0151225 and you must have your research properly well that is in on youtube
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151225_0151432 is that in on the eighteenth
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151652_0152009 how is yours i know that is weird
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199496_0199655 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199655_0200097 just do topics instead of segments you have to get the topics out instead of the segments
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0200097_0200142 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0204919_0205171 so you are going to be able to do a global search for topics
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205569_0205767 is that what you mean yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205965_0206035 man
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206073_0206264 yeah i did think both of that but yeah cool
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206264_0206444 what i did not think you were going to bother with that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206444_0206625 well it can be sad
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206625_0206726 evet tazım
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0207919_0208441 well we will certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it but we are not going to at the very least
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209642_0209821 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209821_0209934 no we will not do that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209934_0210340 well even if i happen to manage to make it do some keywords
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210340_0210705 i do not think we can expect youtube to also come up with a search like that as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210877_0210998 if you are creating it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210998_0211183 i like it yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211183_0211507 yeah i have created it so much faster than i remember doing it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211507_0211992 i did have a look at trying to create xml files
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211992_0212200 that did look like a lot of emission really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212200_0212531 it is not as it is as straightforward as writing in xml files
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212531_0212781 so it is organizing the segment here
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212781_0213044 it just looks so complicated to get it from
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0213203_0214288 the from a plain text file back into organized by who which speaker speaks what and how doing the same i think that was the stupidest way they could ever that is the whole thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214288_0214589 about organizing my time not my speaking
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214589_0214771 i thought i had it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214959_0215201 2월달에
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218105_0218169 yeah we did
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218169_0218366 maen rhaid i ni gwrdd âr cyfarfod nesaf
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0004201_0004336 oh he just looks at me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0007493_0007587 tim slipper
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0009133_0009200 do you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011344_0011435 what
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011435_0011518 that is the answer
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011518_0011696 no that is just summer
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011754_0011982 no i will do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012309_0012442 i will write this
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012641_0012696 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012988_0013625 i did i was trying to i did not have privileges to get in to update your file
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0013625_0014060 i actually meant to send the email and then just continue
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014324_0014843 yeah i forget mine as well it is just like you know every time i put something in there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014843_0015002 so yeah i was yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015002_0015254 that was the main thing so as soon as that is in it will be ready
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015254_0015416 i was making a couple of little changes as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015416_0015672 so those will be able to play with
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015672_0016188 still working on the trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016188_0016478 so that is that is for tonight
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016478_0016680 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016680_0016966 yeah i do not know it is weird come on
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016966_0017340 i am getting a better feel for all these night objects
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017545_0017761 it is just seems a little chaos
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017761_0018272 yeah so i know it is like if you are going to use this stuff later on in your life
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018272_0018612 and you spend the time to invest and learn all about them
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018612_0018924 put to the minimum i can get away with okay i mean what we need
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018924_0019419 unless i want to do something with this in the future
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019590_0019753 alright
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019753_0020065 dear
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020065_0020117 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020297 anyways so
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020934_0020962 i
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021106_0021208 i think yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021208_0021506 i saw that and i am just trying to remember i did create it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021506_0022321 because i was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago so that may be mine
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022549_0022601 oh really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022863_0022940 yeah that is right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022940_0023032 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023032_0023273 yeah so it is not against the analysis
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023273_0023456 yeah get your screen
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023456_0023857 um but yall yeah that was that was that just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024270_0024714 give you false impressions of what is happening
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024880_0025008 i do not know if i can do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025008_0025238 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025238_0025333 hold it up jay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026232_0026377 how does that quote on that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026377_0026667 what did you actually do to her
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026667_0026774 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026774_0026982 so we probably will not have to worry about that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0027676_0027902 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028023_0028142 i know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028142_0028236 how is everything else going
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0029902_0029991 so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030189_0030281 do we want to keep that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030281_0030441 like are we keeping that how that happens
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030441_0031056 it just prints everything out in the shell as well like as it does everything and just kind of i guess that is its default behavior
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031056_0031237 so it is just kind of does not really do anything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031237_0031329 好 谢谢
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0032007_0032077 and that is it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0034811_0035151 i was more or less just playing with the things to do directly with what i was doing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035151_0035394 so i did not take it for a full test run yet
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035394_0035525 but you can do that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035525_0035715 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0036863_0037115 all of this is java sun
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038183_0038603 i think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038603_0038718 it looked better on windows as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038718_0038753 at our
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038753_0038799 kesinlikle
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0039372_0039778 actually can we run it on windows
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040120_0040237 you are nasty
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040589_0040879 were you using like a gui builder or just all from code
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040968_0041094 okay let us
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041310_0041492 that is nice
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041892_0041987 oui
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043448_0043867 can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043867_0043909 hehe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043909_0044253 i tried
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0044253_0044625 i have done some like a couple of them it is a shame to see really speed it up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0050822_0050856 he is always a
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0051559_0051733 it is kind of boring
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0054913_0054979 it is for whatever
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057759_0057819 from oski
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057819_0058348 i do not know if we have a choice so they can filter those out the top most comments
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0058348_0058783 just say okay show all or show you know only
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059359_0059504 i do not know it does not really matter
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059504_0059733 i think you know it would be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0061216_0061303 i think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067906_0067986 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067986_0068106 this is good for browsing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068106_0068152 it is very lucky
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068152_0068407 i mean that is sort of in fact it was one of the ideas in the beginning
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068407_0068548 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068837_0068890 to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0069493_0069749 it is taking me to the next joke
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075358_0075462 let us do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075513_0075642 plus not a real joke anyways
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077116_0077494 so that is sort of
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077764_0077829 yeah i just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0078649_0079199 when i type in all just recompile the browsers and then just get that you will
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079280_0079699 also it uses my product as well my dim search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0080103 actually do we have a naming convention for our source files
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080103_0080384 yeah i am thinking about it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080690_0080798 yeah that is sort of what i was doing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080798_0081025 like for your stuff do you have
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081163_0081249 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081369_0081562 at this point
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081562_0081701 no i was just curious
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081701_0081885 oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082092_0082165 yeah that is true too

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089258_0089791 just probably basic just text font and just something nice something solid maybe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089791_0089834 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090132_0090202 check
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090375_0090402 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090402_0090808 anybody have any artistic talent
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091249_0091487 i just paused because something else happened
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091487_0091840 i do not know something to the edge
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091917_0092258 maybe i will check to see if i can find any
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0092806_0093153 how do you add that to the java program
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093153_0093342 those are just basic rules
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093342_0093493 it is really easy you do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094287_0094388 i have put it there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094440_0094501 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094688_0094729 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095016_0095251 also it will do the automatic scrunching down yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095251_0095320 kitchen
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0096153_0096712 they know it is a distinctive experience
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097105_0097311 i did it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097451_0097610 get sound on these machines
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097654_0098357 have you ever managed to play any sort of music on the dice machines
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098357_0098436 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098676_0098758 do not really trade top
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098758_0098971 if
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0099427_0099484 bleh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100612_0100744 need a lot of audio
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100972_0101247 okay well this looks good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103314_0103778 we are going to be trying to get the output from that i do not know still have not found out if it is sound
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103900_0104113 feasible to open up more than one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104113_0104744 as many objects as we can for each meeting to do like we were going to like figure that the ranking did make sense
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104744_0105104 like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105104_0105252 so we are going to look through only five
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105252_0105882 just pick the top five to do the search since that is probably what we are looking for anyways
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106821_0106975 are you serious
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106975_0107255 maybe i will try yeah you try maybe you might get it right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0107377_0107864 well chuffed yeah they will be surprised to see that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0108383_0108461 yeah that is it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109005_0109126 yeah it was just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109126_0109300 practical job that is it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109808_0110031 how do you guys find the documentation for an xtu
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110161_0110304 yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110304_0110440 smile
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112103_0112218 you know we go
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112218_0112577 well it is still a research platform
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112911_0113066 stream
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113122_0113211 i am trying to choose
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113883_0114458 did we have a date for when we actually want the system done friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0114458_0115163 i thought we said i thought we changed it to the tantra song
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115163_0115809 um because the thing is i mean we can keep working on little things you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115809_0115932 지금
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0116104_0116933 so i do not do we want to set an actual hard deadline or like when exactly where are we going to start the evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117358_0117427 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117427_0117920 well yeah i guess we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117920_0118139 come up with scenarios best sort of thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118139_0118504 i mean that is fairly straightforward
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118504_0118703 i am too extra you tell me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118703_0118805 and i am done
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118805_0119034 just brainstorm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120063_0120141 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120773_0120899 to work on at this school
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121052_0121445 i have got my d and lg presentation on monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121445_0121759 do we need to paint that paint that now
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0122268_0122340 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123133_0123383 we will probably have to talk to steve at some point as well i guess
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123383_0123515 thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123676_0123949 he will probably just have a regular tuesday meeting with him
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123949_0124267 like we could send them an email but i do not know if he is around
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124267_0124755 i think that is why we did not have the meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124939_0125003 hmm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125180_0125261 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125261_0125430 although do we really want the answer
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125430_0125786 so if you do not ask we can push it off
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127258_0127312 be honest
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127630_0127793 right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127793_0127917 we are looking for volunteers
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129036_0129224 yeah if they have time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129224_0129346 very funny people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129674_0129833 yeah i know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130060_0130210 it is not going to take long
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130210_0130370 and you are going to be half now
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130898_0131310 actually some other friends of mine in different programs might be more willing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131310_0131482 have more of a break
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131482_0131772 so then you get a range of types of people as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131772_0132330 like not like highly computer like not you know let it slither it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132330_0132565 i think that might be good as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132565_0132750 so the wider range of people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132950_0133165 three or four maybe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133165_0133775 i would say get him like ten no that would take forever
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133872_0133975 that is not a
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133975_0134636 i think what did an hci course a while ago and it is just that is what they just you know those three people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134718_0134790 that was fun
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134790_0135144 then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135305_0135407 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135407_0135572 we do not want to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135862_0136947 one dude off the street
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137425_0137628 that is not funny
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137628_0137769 mmm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137769_0137988 but yeah if he finds them then that is cool
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137988_0138094 if he finds the people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138094_0138215 thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138516_0138578 oh right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0139203_0139271 two weeks
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140242_0140610 i thought evaluation maybe for the report
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140610_0140752 so that is the next one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140752_0140882 twenty fifty
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140882_0140970 i thought that was lovely
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140970_0141080 that is what i understand
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141247_0141500 i thought you said twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141500_0141952 even though it is good friday it is not a good friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142066_0142163 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142163_0142403 easter to wow
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142418_0142656 what was the three
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142656_0143082 well i am sure on the website it says thursday yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143247_0143567 so that gives us two days to do the evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143567_0143766 no you do not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143766_0143830 you know the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144144_0144408 i did not think so necessarily
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144408_0144537 i would not assume
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144537_0144643 but we should ask them
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145641_0145965 yeah that is probably tight otherwise it is a good target
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145965_0146120 zu küssen
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147092_0147205 straight away and then yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147902_0148058 it is fine
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148058_0148276 it is just funny to have it finished by monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148276_0148594 because after monday i am pretty much free for about a week or so exactly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148594_0149073 it is like we had a bit more time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149456_0149558 oh the next one okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149558_0149960 yeah i am free after this monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149960_0150359 that is easy compared to my fear of it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150359_0150594 i mean i am not even breathing because i do not have anything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150724_0150827 no chance
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150827_0150890 and he must have
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151378_0151464 did not touch
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151464_0151692 i am just kidding
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151692_0151764 how is yours
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151929_0152096 hehe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0152773_0153143 maybe that was us then not him yeah just that is fine
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153143_0153293 i like that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153647_0153757 yeah thursday twenty four
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154007_0154164 to apply for submission of the pilot
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154502_0154676 well now you can end of lectures
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155209_0155380 for twenty four hours
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155884_0156315 just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156649_0156753 we should have it done
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156753_0156839 thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157128_0157274 hopefully but it is still important
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157274_0157747 is that a part of the demonstration do they want that information yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0159586_0159628 oh great
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160781_0160938 a few little things
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160938_0161185 just made some comments at the last meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161185_0161535 just general like how it all integrates blah blah blah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161535_0161657 do we know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161997_0162216 i would expect somewhere between ten and fifteen pages
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162406_0162725 although it is fifty percent of the market
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162725_0162768 so
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163174_0163343 oh we have a bit of time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163473_0163524 it is gonna be good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0164978_0165201 just to fine tune in your detail yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165315_0165359 bye
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165717_0166013 yeah that could be that could easily be like five or six
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169046_0169143 sure
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169143_0169262 no no big rush
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169501_0169604 although just to get it out of the way
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169604_0169952 so i am trying to remember to do that tomorrow
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0171732_0172201 just basic pretty much like the intro do you want to do the intro
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0172201_0172565 just sort of like google
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0173517_0173764 her şeyi çıkarmaktan uzayacağım
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174233_0174429 it does not do anything yet
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174429_0174744 that is the other big part
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174744_0175073 i mean how to get that communication between the two different kinds of windows
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175461_0175946 because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175946_0176441 that was why i was sort of deciding to get the three pains in there instead of just the one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0176699_0177347 yeah so there is a couple of those little things yeah beautiful
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0177347_0177529 and makes more sense
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178574_0178779 is that how it works in the other ones
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178779_0179183 and like the other windows like various like yeah different the topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0179927_0180420 if you have a particular window that you want me to mimic its behavior
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180420_0180825 then just fight it in the program and just say okay just how this one does it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180825_0181051 something like the topic window
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0181663_0182241 so i can just sort of trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring them into you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0187581_0187863 so one left click just highlights
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188300_0188413 i will just add them
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188570_0188695 the transcript or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0189392_0189561 i̇kinci kriş
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0190694_0190785 i should be able to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191221_0191242 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191550_0191944 although yeah this is actually different from how we printed up here
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191944_0192057 like if we are doing a global search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192057_0192623 then we are going to do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192623_0192899 and then we will either multi select or
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192899_0193337 choose the one we want to actually do this i think multi select would make the most sense
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193337_0193727 we will just if there is like three of the top meetings like we said before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193727_0194086 language looking for the word language and get the highest rated ones
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194086_0194615 actually look for the terms we are not loading it on fall seventy six
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194615_0195308 so the results from that will narrow down what we are going to use for the local search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195308_0195571 so we will just do the local search on those ones that are chosen
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195571_0195821 oh i see what you mean okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195821_0196372 so it will be a bit different from how that is right now when we do the research at least
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197254_0197407 yes if not you can not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197407_0197508 good time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0201665_0201959 so that we search two different
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0202422_0202634 that is actually fairly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203017_0203143 yeah local anyways
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203143_0203227 now that is easy
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203227_0203393 yeah would you make that that would be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203393_0203597 that is quitestrictful
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206489_0206636 well you can not say
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206636_0206734 evet daha zoruna gittik
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206901_0207310 are we bothering with our topic stuff
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207310_0207511 or is that sort of like our own topic segment
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207511_0207760 like since we can not do the labeling and all the rest
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207760_0207915 we are still doing our topic segment
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207915_0208053 well what is that you are do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0208316_0209096 but we are not going to be doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they do not have labels
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209233_0209491 like all the label ones
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209491_0209673 yeah i will be label two
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209673_0209740 hmm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210577_0210642 yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210642_0210701 jack
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210701_0210871 well no it would be kind of straightforward
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210871_0211092 if you are creating it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218435_0218498 probably not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218498_0218791 i mean just get work done
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218791_0218984 i think that is what i have got to do
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001099_0001453 we are not allowed to get in light so who is gonna use it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001887_0002029 unfortunately because of the
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002237_0002381 am i supposed to be standing up today
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002986_0003229 yeah good
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008190_0008382 hello everybody
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008382_0009196 i am sarah the project manager and this is our first interview surprisingly enough
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009196_0009474 okay this is our agenda
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009568_0010193 we will do some stuff get to know each other a bit better feel more comfortable with each other
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010193_0010814 then we will go do chill training talk about the project plan
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010814_0011589 discuss our own ideas and everything and we have got twenty five minutes to do that as far as i can understand
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0011762_0012154 now we are developing a remote control which you probably already know
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012154_0012699 we want it to be original something that people have not thought of
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012699_0013201 it is not out in the shops trendy appealing to a wide market
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0013201_0014283 but you know not a hunk of metal and user friendly grannies to kids maybe even pooches should be able to use it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014283_0014958 okay first is the functional design this is where we all go off and do our individual work
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014958_0015940 what needs need to be fulfilled by the product what effect the product has to have and how it is actually going to do that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0015940_0016094 and conceptual design
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0016231_0016780 what we are thinking how it is going to go and then the detailed design how we are actually going to put it into practice and make it work
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017038_0017203 okay right
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017203_0018410 we are going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard i will go first and so what is the characteristics of this animal
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0018883_0019207 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0021146_0021197 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024322_0024433 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024789_0025060 and i am going to ask these guys in a bit to tell you that so let us be a tiger
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025453_0025724 and i see that justice
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025989_0026225 amen
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0027231_0027542 i would like to come back
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028757_0028966 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028966_0029010 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0035001_0035109 okay thank you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0037384_0037686 well as you can see the quality of the work today is that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039399_0039492 just thinking look at that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039631_0039980 can you be alright
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0042011_0042095 tesla
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0043985_0044177 thank you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0046109_0046216 technical help
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0048966_0049134 okay good
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0050119_0050466 right not a seagull
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0055448_0055515 thank you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056312_0056546 that was fun brilliant
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056546_0057464 finance wise we have got a selling price at twenty five euros which i do not actually know what that is in pounds at all
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0057464_0057532 any ideas
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058385_0058512 yeah that is right
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058638_0058798 okay
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0059098_0059592 i think so i think i would be able to pull it up or i could put it in shared folders
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0060813_0060929 i suppose later it depends
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061351_0061782 yeah production costs at twelve point five zero
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061913_0062426 half of the selling price is taken up by building it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0062426_0062944 and profit aim is fifteen million euros which is
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0063129_0063642 you yes yeah i presume so
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0064913_0065029 everyone using it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0065357_0066222 target group yes yes i do not think we have to i do not think it is a case of worrying about different languages and things like that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0066222_0066970 making that key point just that it is going to be an international market like australia america things like that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067520_0067829 what are your experiences with hormone controls
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067829_0068347 i mean i have got we got um we had three videos
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0068347_0069167 a tv and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069167_0069939 and that you program each of your things into but that kept losing the signals so we would have to reprogram it every now and again
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069939_0070270 i think it was quite cheapy as well
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070270_0070483 but that was quite good the fact that you could
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070596_0070891 did not have six remote controls sitting in front of you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073498_0073730 yeah that is the main stuff anyway
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073730_0075176 i mean and you do not want to i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the tally text button or something
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0075743_0077073 when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions when you can do sound or options kind of recording
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077073_0077283 things like that inside it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077283_0077979 because when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at it is obvious what you are doing
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081235_0081365 what about the older generation
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081365_0081509 i love that granny and granddad is
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081615_0082363 my granddad can answer his mobile phone but he could not even dream of texting or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0082812_0083151 i do not think they are teaching
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0084120_0084324 yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0086430_0087174 i do not know how i do not like the new phones that have a windows based running system
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087295_0087683 i find it really confusing i kept getting lost in the first place
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087683_0088287 i have not got a new one but my friend is got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0088438_0088517 that is just me
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0090577_0090750 okay same
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091369_0091737 i wore back kind of a dual function
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091737_0092964 in that you have got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things and also a menu to go into with obvious pictures
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0092964_0093488 obvious symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0094848_0095316 i think that is a cost thing i do not know how much we are going to know about
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0095602_0095807 yeah he has improved
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0097097_0097935 right okay we have got half an hour before the next meeting so we are all going to go off and do our individual things
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0098120_0098951 i think that is probably about it and then we will come back and laze again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102232_0102399 i would yeah probably
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102504_0102689 i mean the sky remote controls and everything
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102689_0103258 and they are kind of molded and look a bit different and the tally west remote controls are silver plastic
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103258_0103865 which looks a bit smarter so yeah i guess that is tough if you think about it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103865_0104156 okay so let us break out there
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104313_0104416 so see you in half an hour
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104776_0104904 thanks jo
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002515_0002683 i have got both of these clipped on
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002912_0003048 yeah good

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0050809_0051149 a there you go again i am digging on my feet good man
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051149_0051612 because they are also independent but i do not know yet

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054715_0054953 hehe
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0055366_0055677 see you charlie
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058488_0058597 seventeen pounds
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058837_0058954 should we be making notes of this
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058954_0059174 gallwn ni ddweud yna ir holl ddau
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0059174_0059228 i think so
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0060809_0061392 maen dweud y byddwn yn gweithio yn y ffordd y byddwn yn ei wneud
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063037_0063120 in our first year
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063810_0064823 you have got market range international and you did say earlier it is got to be accessible and usable by all age groups we are not focusing on business market
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0064823_0065111 unrhyw un yn unig
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0065341_0065540 big target group yes
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071292_0071717 my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071717_0072244 not doing any tampering with it and programming using it to program tv videos and things
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072244_0072768 but basically on off volume up and down channel one two that basic function
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072768_0073605 i do not think i could go any further with it than that so i suppose it is got to be something usable by someone like me as well yeah the main
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0075081_0075529 maer cyflawniadau y byddwch chin ei ddeall yn anodd
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0076852_0076898 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0077978_0078326 actually that just raises a point i wonder what our design people think
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078326_0078704 but you know on a mobile phone you can press a key and it gives you a menu
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078704_0079448 i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful so you have got a little lcd display
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0080380_0080592 with menus
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0082379_0082797 can he program his remote controller is he basic with that too
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083464_0083927 so that is the problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083927_0084464 that is going to be a problem anyway with the older generation of mums and that is another issue we tackle that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0089871_0090564 is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0090564_0091178 obviously it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that is the main thing
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0093518_0094012 the other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094012_0094353 you could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094353_0094756 you can have a bigger screen in the flipover
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095678_0095860 yes it might have his skull
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095969_0096635 and there is no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone it can still be lightweight plastic
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0096635_0096916 something that is easily moulded and chews
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0096916_0097245 sorry i am treading in your territory garth
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0100506_0100574 so much
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0100916_0101130 sure yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101370_0101720 good yeah i mean it does not have to be that great
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101720_0101945 that was my main point
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101945_0102210 i do not know if using plastic does make it cheaper i have seen it would
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0102210_0102441 yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0104642_0104829 do we go back to moon lake
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0031569_0031739 hi
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035348_0035555 bye
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035911_0036174 oh what is that all there is nothing on the chair
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0036174_0036765 oh since you guys have chosen what is our next dish okay is it looking like a dog actually
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037143_0037529 and also my drawing skill is not that great well as you can see your quote
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037960_0038448 okay now i am going to have to change what it was originally because that looks like a beak
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039041_0039795 crocodile yeah it is a little crocodile it can be a little dog
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039795_0040627 well firstly it was an attempt at a t rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be herpes
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0042120_0042597 ie ac rwyn meddwl yn y lle or pethau
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0042812_0043022 uh scary

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0043874_0044199 yeah that is fine i think it is okay
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0044523_0044668 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0049740_0049998 gentle the warmth
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0050176_0050322 right
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0051987_0052095 they are good at golf
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0052430_0052863 yeah ego ego oh not good
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0057511_0057766 i am not a mic dude
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0058085_0058757 yeah yeah something like that so yeah about seventeen pounds seventeen pounds okay
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0059419_0060321 having said that though if you want to get one of those the ones on the market at the moment they are about pound twenty anyway
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0060321_0060809 so yeah we had fireworks
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0070110_0070188 yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0070518_0070672 you sold the one you did not have
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0071124_0071332 yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0082937_0083405 yeah my grandad is actually better than me at using teletext
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0084373_0084958 you know why it just needs to be as long as it is so self intuitive and you can can work out
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085098_0085279 why everything is staying
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085279_0086194 menus on new phones now they have got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you are trying to do
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0086443_0086588 i do not know how
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0087018_0087069 oh yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0088518_0089370 i do not know how for twenty five or twelve euros fifty how much of an excellent screen you could get
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0089370_0089931 you would have to sort of keep it down to a black and white lcd thing anyway is it possible
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0097068_0097179 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0098880_0099666 just a quick thing about what you were saying about it does not need to be fashionable
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0099666_0100524 i had a quick look at the company website and it is like the we put the fashion into electronics
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0100524_0101484 so i think the whole design thing might be quite i mean you do not you can still have plastic and it look quite good but
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0000037_0000176 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0006420_0006633 what is it ted
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008050_0008166 okay
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008322_0008403 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0025591_0025625 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0027508_0027545 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028514_0028661 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028908_0029068 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029068_0029332 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029332_0029602 maybe you can guess what i am trying to make
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031347_0031914 it is actually fitting so it is fitting
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031914_0032186 okay i see it as one thing it is very supportive
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032413_0032773 it is your best friend in your life you can talk to your dog it can be your best friend
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032773_0033136 आपको पर जब आप हैं जो पर जब आप हैं जो पर जब आप हैं
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0033136_0034096 second is loyal and third thing is intuition
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0034096_0035106 dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features i think belong to a dog okay thank you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0035106_0035147 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0036433_0036784 okay
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0050178_0050267 right
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057676_0057871 learn by doing
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057871_0058150 yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0061754_0061959 오케이 그렇게 얘기는 하지 마
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0063639_0063710 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0069149_0069222 yn y blynyddoedd maer cyfle ir holl ddysgu yn ymwneud âr cyfle i ddysgu yn y ffurfioedd
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0070861_0071104 you want to integrate everything into one line
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0075518_0075806 when there is a
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0078708_0078774 may god bless you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079289_0079360 little elf
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079446_0080057 i was thinking of the same lines you instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080057_0080603 maybe have an lcd display or something like that like a mobile with menus with menus yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080603_0081203 and if it is somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone people might find it easier to browse and navigate
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0081521_0081896 my granddad can answer his questions
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0094604_0094666 okay
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095091_0095738 you do not know how much we are gonna know about it might save up a bit of space instead of looking bulky it might look small
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095738_0095924 but it might have its cost implications
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0104805_0104838 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000818_0000982 is that playing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000982_0001080 it is grace black
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003704_0003883 i am alright again
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003883_0003972 action
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0005545_0005586 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0006681_0007420 right okay i am just sort of sick and waiting and i might be a bit old over the place
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0007420_0007886 right our agenda for today do you want us to give you a second
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008127_0008353 okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008593_0008870 i will go over what we just made in the last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0009263_0009912 we decided upon a universal control one hand set for all two b videos
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0010181_0011216 that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers wide age range not limiting anyone
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0011216_0012023 we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product we put fashion in electronics that kind of thing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0012023_0012947 our budget would have to try not to reflect our budget
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013141_0013633 i have a bit of oh oh you can see it okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013633_0014340 a dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014485_0014869 wanted to look uncluttered and daunting to the customer
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014869_0015936 we discussed a flip open design reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming things like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016324_0016680 i have got written here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016866_0017062 shall we hear from marketing first
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017503_0017732 no that is fine that is fine okay yeah okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017907_0017982 and parking
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019400_0019512 oh fn
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019596_0019726 function as it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0033828_0033873 why you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0052766_0053017 the whole game
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053017_0053235 would you like to continue on from there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053591_0053854 maybe with that too
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0059477_0059630 it is fun to think about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0061274_0061355 감사합니다
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077551_0077886 i think we will try to sprout it at the end
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077886_0078435 okay so if anyone wants to write something down i want to be in the end
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0078855_0079091 bye
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0079260_0079339 oop
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080268_0080336 mbc 뉴스 이덕영입니다
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080959_0081103 you just did it bess
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084130_0084197 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084490_0084543 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0103869_0104058 right
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0104172_0104485 we have new project requirements
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0105110_0106034 we are not going to be using teletext partly consumers consider it outdated with the internet now
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106240_0106856 our control is only going to be for tv it is not going to be combined control
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106856_0107844 which limits all of the different things it limits the cost for us but it also makes it easier to understand
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0108057_0109180 says for tb only so looks like it is just yeah i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it but
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109419_0109550 i do not know what you think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109550_0109781 it just said for tv only
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109781_0110213 i mean general tv controls do do video as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0110444_0110888 i mean well all sorts of stuff you get combined tv and video stuff
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0112245_0112700 i think we assume it is still got plain stop functions and programming
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0118844_0119020 but um
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120074_0120646 we do have a budget limitation that we can not control ourselves
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120646_0121783 so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing because it is something it needs to be the thing that you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0121865_0122367 used to find it needs to be something that you do not lose so you are staying whistling
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122367_0122886 maybe on the tv you could put like a pack on the tv or something so you can not see the remote
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122886_0123385 you go and press the button on top of the tv and it beeps
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123385_0123711 something like that but that sounds a lot cheaper to me
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123800_0124766 the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0124766_0125253 so we want logo we want
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125490_0125856 fashionable trendy i mean what you were talking about with the marketing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125931_0126371 and people paying more for it to look good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0126492_0126781 we need to focus on that as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132038_0132750 what about you were talking about the buttons the controls that are coming out now have
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132750_0133469 rubber buttons not tiny little big rubber buttons but watertight i mean because we have got to make it original
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133620_0133736 what about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133869_0134201 we know with the touch screen computers
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0134432_0135394 so it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either not sure about that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135518_0135840 you do not have to press it you just have to put your thumb onto it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135840_0137075 i think that might appeal i am thinking kind of japan i am thinking young office people trendy
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137206_0137531 but quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137531_0138564 easily labelled so that anyone can say oh yeah that is obvious what that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generation
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0140284_0140357 little more specific
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0145256_0146158 i think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146158_0146540 or they can make it bigger or they can change the future slightly
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146796_0147715 it is going to be the same so we need to focus on just one thing and not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0151286_0151974 or a speech recognition which is extremely expensive i think that is the only way that you can avoid
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0152084_0152177 that can erase you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0154752_0155002 we are talking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155203_0155496 the type of company that we are working for as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155496_0156520 that they want it to be fashionable they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically associate that with the older generations
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0156520_0157418 now with the baby boomers the older generations are actually larger they have a greater population than us young people
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0157418_0157983 but i do not think we are focusing on that i think we are focusing on a sort of mid range
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0158124_0158361 business class type people
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160471_0160942 okay so the remote control functions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160942_0161612 we have got the tv we have got the video now there is
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0161750_0162392 i can not remember what it is called the little code at the end of program details video plus yes
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0162580_0163755 we could use that as an alternative to programming in times things like that i always found that really easy when i discovered it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0163884_0164486 because you have got your general record anyway so if there is a program on you want to put record on
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164486_0164979 that is fine but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not sure if you are going to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164979_0165402 you put the number in and it is just a number it is not a date it is not time
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0165402_0165877 it is not a channel it is not when it finishes it is not anything like that it is just a number
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166423_0166641 you have already got the numbers for tapioca anyway
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166940_0167575 is after if you look in the newspaper or tv guide or any tv guide there is a five
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0167575_0169104 six digit number afterwards and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on on tuesdays at ten oclock on the seventeenth things like that so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169104_0169455 and it has been around for a long time
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169712_0170288 no it is not but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0172221_0172299 okay so
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0179443_0180041 the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there you are pressing this button and your tv is not doing it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0180125_0180592 taking your tv and your controller and saying look this is what i am doing it is not working what should i do
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181366_0181542 that is great okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181827_0181972 instruction manuals
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181972_0182307 but i mean there is customer service
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0182307_0183125 there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there is no call out charge
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0183125_0183634 is no extra person has to walk to a shop in the high street
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0184469_0185430 but we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little variety and lots and lots of pages
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185430_0185816 it does you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185816_0186123 so that should be something we will think about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186123_0186346 what other functions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186346_0186957 i am not sure if we need a design decision now
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186957_0187714 but we should think about because you have got the dilemma between oh batteries that is what i was thinking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0187714_0187922 what about film batteries what kind of battery is that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0188854_0189772 well they last quite a long time and if you had when you the thing that you get with mobile house phones
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0189772_0190169 you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or at night or something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190169_0190674 but it does not really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time once it is charged
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190674_0191003 something like that should reduce displacement
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0191820_0192107 yeah it could be on that yeah yeah okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0192773_0192946 rechargeable with a docking station
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193074_0193261 so the recharge moment should be here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193952_0194291 yes which is cheaper in london as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194291_0194770 and the shape you have got trendy
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194770_0195498 i do not want a big box with lots of things you do not want a tiny sort of little thing either
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0195498_0196249 because then you have got the repetitive strain and it does not matter how much you try and make it simple
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0196609_0196676 they do
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0197718_0197875 okay so we have got a flip screen
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0201381_0201563 because it is kind of locked into your hand right
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0202640_0203026 when you look into the company logo
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0203150_0204079 things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204079_0204130 i mean
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204322_0205260 for example if it was a sea or something like that you could have it in a vague c shape that opens up kind of like a shell
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0205260_0205875 or something something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0206040_0206644 obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that is there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0208341_0208598 well we need to think about how it is going to look different
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212165_0212769 or you could do different like you get with mobile phones different fashes
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212769_0213100 you could have different kind of casings
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0213100_0213867 so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0216498_0216776 right i think we have to round it out
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0218236_0219067 that was in cutting down the number of functions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0219067_0219618 making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you could update
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0220670_0221444 it takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel things like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221444_0221589 doing it could be
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221657_0222602 yes it could be an advertisement feature rather than a design feature draw attention to that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0222671_0223557 and also paid lip service in the instruction manual because it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0224964_0225675 we have got the buttons but i think we will work through that with the design of it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0226198_0226844 and we have talked about there being an alarm or something a beeping for being lost
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227005_0227308 learning how to use it should be as simple as possible
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227308_0228085 there are not going to be that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the instruction manual
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228085_0228384 i do not know if we deal with that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228594_0228670 i think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228984_0229266 yeah and different from what is out there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0229266_0229414 yeah i think that is us
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230012_0230375 i think you might get guidance but
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230550_0230564 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230717_0230976 instruction manuals because there tends to be a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0231160_0231851 demonized thing everyone is got a big pile of them but no one really uses them
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0232414_0232555 yes right
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233087_0233150 끝
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233342_0233739 i think you can email me if there is any more questions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233929_0234196 i know i will be able to not answer them
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0004768_0004918 good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0008031_0008152 no that is okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0017101_0017584 is it okay if i postpone that till later i just want to get access to a little bit more information no that is fine
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0031970_0032302 gallaf ymdrech i gofyn cwestiwn
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0032302_0032675 you are saying the chevrolet batteries are small and the other cars
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0033595_0033876 those batteries in
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0034157_0034256 i am just wondering
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0051715_0052358 very important boy that came up in our market research findings to you so i can refer to that all right okay and
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060486_0060728 blood has not come out at the
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060904_0061000 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080309_0080569 oh i have got to keep this here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080569_0080653 count
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080875_0081185 you do not have to you just did a turn
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081185_0081594 whoops you need to push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081594_0081740 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081740_0082067 yep love is a monomaniac
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083136_0083235 yw hynnyn iawn
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083679_0083990 thank you let us pull it closer a little bit
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084171_0084387 좋아요
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084563_0085725 okay i am going to look at the functional requirements from a marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0085725_0086149 so that is where we started we used our usability lab
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086149_0086670 the company is usability lab we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086670_0087219 o ran fifteen oed a gweithio gyda nhw yn y lab
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087219_0087626 just their general use of the remote control you can see we had one hundred subjects there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087633_0088097 our findings lots of findings i have just summarised some of them here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088097_0088814 the overall thing which i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088814_0089076 mae cyfleoedd dylunion amlwg yno
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089076_0089559 rydyn nin ddod o hyd ir fath bod seventy five percent or defnyddwyr yn teimlo bod cyflawnir cyffredinau cyffredinol yn ddiddorol
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089695_0090332 eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy we were quite surprised by that finding
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0090332_0091220 but that is quite a high proportion of our international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091220_0091790 current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091790_0092588 fel enghraifft gallwch weld yna seventy five percent or defnyddwyr yn zapion fawr felly mae eich person yn cael ei gael yn y sofa yn y canolfan yn y canolfan
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092588_0092783 felly eto dynar cyfleoedd fawr yno
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092792_0093454 fifty percent or defnyddwyr ddefnyddio unig ten percent or botwmau felly eto yna ddifrif o ddesain
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0093454_0094252 a gallwn hefyd gyrraedd y cyfrifau ar ôl os nad oes cyfnodau ar y cwbl rheol
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0094690_0095591 the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier remote controls are often lost in the room
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0095591_0096272 or fath or cyd destun yn y chwrdd roedd fifty percent yn ystod y cyfrifoldeb
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0096272_0097238 mae thirty four percent o bobl yn dweud bod angen cymaint o amser i ddysgu a ddefnyddio rwyn credu bod hynnyn cydnabod âr ddysgu cynnig o bobl syn defnyddio ten percent sign or botwmau
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0097238_0097521 syn gallu cael ei ddysgu am y ffynciau eraill
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0097607_0098356 slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0098356_0098896 you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0098896_0099689 the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0099689_0100431 ac yn ôl dyna oedd yn golygu rwyn credu pan oeddent wedi rhannur cyflawni arall rhai ffordd o adnodd sgwrs
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100431_0100548 something we did not put to them
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100548_0101364 which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again until you find it or a flashing light
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101496_0101820 that trend reverses in the older age groups
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101820_0102050 so thirty five s and unders who would like those two features
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102050_0102645 mae hynnyn teimlon unig o thirty five i forty five oed ac yn y grŵp oedran maen rhoir cyflawniad nid ydynt yn ymddangos
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102724_0103167 i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you but i think i will just keep it simple
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0103167_0103614 if there is any more information i can email you extra details is that okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0107683_0108058 so can we not program a video with this remote control
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0108448_0108535 it is just
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0109768_0109931 would that mean general tv can
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0110866_0111006 is the end if you have got
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0113429_0114281 rydyn ni ddim yn edrych arno ond rwyn cofio ein bod nin cael y cyfieithu bod y mwyaf o bobl yn defnyddio ten percent or botwmau
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114281_0114818 rwyn credu bod y rhai hynnyn teimlon bod yn y canol bwysig syn helpu i gynnwys pethau ac yn cynnwys fideo yn gyflym
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114818_0115453 ac ati rwyn credu bod yna ddysgu cyffredinol y bydd pobl yn cael eu hysbysun rhaglen eu fideo ac rydw in
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0115453_0115669 felly dydw i ddim yn gwybod a yw hynnyn rhywbeth rhaid i ni ei wneud
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0116582_0117240 i have just called up that table there we asked those two questions the table relates to both questions so we did not differentiate
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0117240_0117928 would you prefer an lcd screen that is a multi function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition and remote control
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0117928_0118404 felly gallwch weld sut maer ddweud yw yn ddifrif ar draws grwp oedran
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0118404_0118899 mae cymaint o ddiddordeb yn y byd oedran dwin credu bod hynnyn golygu technoleg newydd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0119631_0119703 hello
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0123366_0123469 something like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0126734_0127142 wow further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0127142_0127782 maen mynd i fod yn wahanol i fifteen oed i rywun sydd â sixty oed ac hefyd ar draws byd remy yng nghymdeithasol
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0127782_0128591 what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african i do not know you get the idea
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0128591_0128772 it is going to vary around the world
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0128772_0129154 at the end of the day the engineering design is one thing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0129154_0129967 maer dylunior defnyddwyr ddefnyddiol yn gallu ac ymdrechion ffashionol y byddwn yn rhaid i ni newid ar gyfer gwahaniaethau gwahanol ar y byd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0137001_0137251 it would appeal to sections of the lord eden
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0138337_0138495 generation
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0146528_0146951 the internal engineering design has got to remain the same it is going to be the same so we are not
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0147756_0148224 i am concerned when you raise the rsi issue again repetitive strain injury
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148224_0148581 i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148581_0148982 i think that is still a kind of question mark issue how we deal with that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148982_0149485 rsi tends to be caused by repetitive small movements
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0149607_0150179 dwi ddim yn gallu cael fy nghydrwch yma maen rhaid i mi fod yn ymddangos in cyfarfod ar gyfer y cyfarfod y dylai ni ddweud
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0151052_0151322 around the transgript chapter that becomes
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0152211_0152875 do we have to initially looking at the findings here focus on
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153020_0153426 yn y grŵp oedran ynghylch ac ynan ychydig or brif farchnad ymlaen
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153426_0153757 do we really have to go for everyone right away
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0154265_0154787 maen dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn dweud yn d
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158340_0158878 i am just thinking of budgetary issues too for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158878_0159335 you want to not waste money not be profligate
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159538_0159772 in a focus on where the idea will be taken up
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159772_0160276 first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0166569_0167039 i am not going to cross that function but it sounds wonderful
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0167960_0168027 and it is
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0171461_0171636 excellent
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172320_0172808 can i just run this past you while it occurs to me i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172808_0173473 ond maen ddweud y bydd y grŵpau oedran ar grŵpau oedran syn cyllid eu cyllid yn ymwneud â phobl ifanc syn cynnig eu ffilmau cyfansoddiadol
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0173473_0174307 that is kind of what led us on to comparing tv remote controls with their design features chain companies like carphone warehouse
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174307_0174740 you can pop in any time with a phone that you have bought for them if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174740_0175078 the company you can use their telephones
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175078_0175985 is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175985_0176511 if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets you know which button is it i press for this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0176511_0176914 that is a free aspect of our service would that not make it more attractive to her
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180470_0180828 working what should i do if it was something as simple as you could not change the channel
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180828_0181323 but i mean if there were any more or we are absolutely definite it is only going to be for tv and video
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0181323_0181622 ie i mi ie oce dwin meddwl
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0184190_0184550 we should
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185334_0185586 it is people over eating them it does
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185840_0186028 that should be something we will think about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196261_0196662 ac nid ydym mae cyfansoddau cyfansoddau cyfansoddau yn edrych yn unigol iawn ydy
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196662_0197058 rowed things with the same coloured buttons all crowned in on the surface
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0197058_0197764 maen ddifrifol ond maen ddifrifol iawn i allu or rectangleau ffyrdd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0200379_0200552 banana chip kind of thing coated
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0206780_0206923 in that way too
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0208703_0209017 i think that is that is a really attractive idea
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209017_0209569 i have not come across anything like that before and that opens out into your flip top
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209569_0209833 it is nice to have you can make it lightweight plastic
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209833_0210338 nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210338_0210880 that is going to take care of some of the additive strain injury trying to prevent a lot of it i would think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210880_0211441 i think it is a really nice idea you can get even though we are using plastic
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0211441_0212121 you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic you can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213830_0213973 less chance of it being lost to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213973_0215162 it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is going to go down the sofa people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever it looks attractive in on as a kind of ornament and they are not going to lose it so much
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0215162_0215553 maen dda iawn iw ddweud
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0216798_0217196 gallaf i gyflwynor cyfrifoldeb newydd i gyd er mwyn i mi ddim ei bod yn rhaid i mi gael unrhyw beth
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0217196_0218132 so it is no teletext selling for tv and by implication video corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control something about video plus
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219412_0219960 so when they press the program it comes up on the lcd a reminder about using videoplus
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219960_0220091 byddent yn edrych ar y cyfarwydd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0220232_0220665 oes hyn ddim yn ymwneud âr cyfrifoldeb
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0221346_0221738 that so it is doing a lot of programming features
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223519_0223739 and the rechargeable batteries
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223739_0224192 a oes unrhyw beth eraill yno
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225709_0225935 that is not at the moment a requirement it is something we are looking at
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225935_0226310 iawn yn ystod y cyfrifiadau byddwn yn dod i mewn ir farchnad ar unrhyw le
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229455_0229731 what would you specifically like marketing to look up for the next meeting
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229731_0230004 neu y byddwn in edrych ar unigrwyddau
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232273_0232423 oops got a snack bar
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232530_0232698 because we love einstein
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017650_0017791 okay yeah okay fine
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017791_0017931 hello crabby
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019155_0019224 first
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019224_0019332 então até a próxima
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019684_0019789 hmm
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0020998_0021062 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021250_0021849 this is the working design presented by me the industrial design maestro in there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021996_0022501 okay this is where i went a bit mad with part one
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022501_0022885 the first question asked was what are we trying to design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022885_0023358 well a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change the state
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023358_0023844 whether that be the power or the channel or the volume
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023844_0024692 everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the tv or other appliances sending the signal to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0024903_0025738 so i decided i would have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0025738_0026006 but although we will want to be taking
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0026148_0027208 ideas from other people we want to make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it was not really my area because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027266_0027489 i am dealing with the inside really
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027489_0028055 yeah i ran out of time so i could not do this one as fun as the last one
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0028055_0029482 i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use for
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029482_0029852 wireless and you do not need to send very much information
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029852_0030249 most of them are powered by some form of battery
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030249_0030387 now r one
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030387_0032173 i am not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by aaa batteries but those can be quite bulky so i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the controller
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032173_0032222 yes
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032558_0032617 i am
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032617_0033253 if you look at most remote controls they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033253_0033769 they have to be obviously this size to fit those batteries in
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033769_0034754 yeah well you can get the sort of circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0034754_0035461 which leads on to the next point about being small and easy to carry around
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0035461_0036032 now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036119_0036880 y ffynonell gwreiddiol y gwnes i oedd y ffwrdd hwnnw ir batriwmau oherwydd nid oes modd i hynny weithio
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036880_0037334 as i said about the which batteries we were going to choose
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0037334_0039212 you can discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you are putting in from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal which we are going to use to send the information
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0039212_0040149 now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is suitable for anyone who is watching their tv unless they are in a cinema
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040149_0040724 which not most people do so that is where i find the most audience that should be fine
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040724_0041786 and then i just had a quick look at the external design but i left that basically to the interface designer
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0041918_0042276 and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we want to do
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042276_0042828 it is not a proper circuit i am not sure if it will work or not
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042828_0043307 i am not even confident that that is the real way you would wire it up but anyway
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0043307_0044180 so we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb the chip and the ui interface
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044335_0044440 which would basically
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044440_0045351 when you press anything the chip would convert it into some form of ir data which could be decoded by the tv receiver
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045351_0045881 which obviously means that we are going to have to conform to whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045992_0047240 um wide form of communication that the tv is are already using and since that is another reason to use infrared because that is what all tv is use at the moment
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047240_0047388 and then finally
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047388_0048772 we want it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i have put forward are lowering costs so that should be good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0048772_0049534 it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049534_0049953 we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049953_0051225 because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of i do not know some anti going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051225_0051707 that was just sort of a general point there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051707_0051903 a very important point that came up
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0052171_0052865 alright okay and yeah that is what i came up with there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0059548_0059679 function of that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0060745_0061098 my eyes are on this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0078292_0078370 cheers
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0082660_0082831 ja det gör det
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0083072_0083098 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0084009_0084398 you should be able to yeah i am sure i will thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0109929_0110099 charles yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110365_0110586 i do not know why i am trying to do it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110905_0111510 is
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0111510_0112232 you can record straight off the tv anyway onto the tv hard drive or something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0115583_0116633 just as an idea on the speech recognition thing it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they are not that great
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0116764_0116844 we all need to be prepared
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0117659_0117763 more for speech
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0118863_0120080 but on that again i just thought because you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so i thought that could be cool
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0130630_0131204 well yeah you could have a number of different designs i mean inside they would be essentially exactly the same
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0131327_0131716 the features could be same and the body could look slightly different
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0134069_0134462 yeah computers yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0135290_0135625 well no because you would not have to you do not have to press it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138496_0138917 but also ergonomics as we were saying of the different designs
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138917_0140603 ergonomics there is sort of physically different things because if you have ever seen the xbox they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the control was physically too big because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0140693_0142376 they are cut just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they can go around the controller which is so if you i do not know what because you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and small ones for other
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0150192_0151305 i was just thinking about how you could combat that because without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the jacket it becomes
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0151424_0151723 yeah in the future which is extremely expensive
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0154022_0154151 yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0162240_0162351 video plus yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0163198_0163315 yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0164781_0164911 in two days time and you are not sure
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165687_0165894 anything like that is just number
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165894_0166237 and you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0166237_0166555 yeah well because you have already got you have already got the numbers for
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0167185_0167280 newspaper or tv
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0169347_0169912 it is been around for a long time it is just it is not very well advertised no it is not
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0170330_0171457 if you have got something like sky anyway you can just press the button on the program once and it will record that program when it is on you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171608_0171863 so yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171863_0172203 but just have that function be really good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0177063_0179451 but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you sign for a contract so the companies who you deal with have actually they have got an obligation to help you out and also i mean it is fair enough to have some sort of help service but i am not sure how much the cost would be right
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181345_0181412 yeah it is amazing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181639_0182014 i mean instruction manuals
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0182540_0182649 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0184229_0184510 maer ffocwsau yn ddim yn ddim
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0185403_0185487 i do not
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0187956_0188561 and they are specially made for the mobile phones
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0188561_0188987 but they come with a charger i mean you could you could bundle a charger
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0190909_0191734 yeah and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the blooper in the room then could
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0191928_0192056 yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0192552_0192970 yeah some sort of docking station or rechargeable with a docking station
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0193338_0193963 yeah yeah that would be fine and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0053624_0053899 maybe with that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059104_0059321 okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059321_0059379 a free trade
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060255_0060416 hmm
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060673_0060814 it is good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0061620_0062515 actually some of my points might overlap with what william just mentioned but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0062515_0063547 this took up a valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think will take a feedback from the marketing because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0063691_0064255 i have not had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064255_0064919 so purpose as william already said i would put it to simplify the interaction with tv to make it as simple as possible
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064919_0065298 and to summarize i would say it should be user friendly by being easy to use
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0065404_0066192 rather than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering driven maybe having one hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066315_0066622 like volume control or channel changing the channel or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066741_0067462 but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy we will punch in these two features together
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067462_0067737 so what the concept is to have a flip top model
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067737_0069035 the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to say program their favorite channels or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069035_0069351 can be put in the middle part of the flip top
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069351_0070654 so it is like it could be accessed by a wider range of audience and we can punch in new features such as added features such as shop roof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0070826_0072814 findings most people prefer user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they have not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in those trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse a user
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0072814_0073649 as we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economy of higher production like fifty million research
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0073649_0074378 yeah with that i think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also so we can add more features and make it less costly
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0074762_0075212 that is so this is if you ask me personally i would make a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0075447_0076762 flip top with a trendy design and maybe we should look at also like the buttons whether they are like soft or little hard because there are times the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0076762_0076903 jadi overall it is simple lah lah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077084_0077176 user friendly design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077302_0077469 any comments
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080345_0080468 to keep this here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080544_0080661 you can not
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080727_0080950 you will have to disconnect it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081300_0081424 you know to push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081928_0082028 i am gonna put some on
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0083436_0083550 प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर प्रस्तुत्र पर पर पर पर
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0103476_0103651 is that okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0112627_0113386 programming yeah anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0114090_0114129 ten percent
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0130021_0130539 so are we talking of a single model or maybe five six designs
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0131349_0131665 the features could be same and the body could look slightly different
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0142436_0143060 yeah maybe to as it was indicated the risk for repeated use
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143060_0143427 the injuries maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143672_0144196 so a bigger okay so you are dividing designs based on not only segment h two
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144196_0144633 you are dividing it according to the countries also the market
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144633_0145286 maybe for us and all you can have a slightly bigger remote and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0153750_0153940 we could focus on our biggest market
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0154040_0154364 i would say people between age twenty to thirty five are the biggest
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0183560_0184036 i think it had too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0184036_0184327 but for remote he will just report to the bank
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0192253_0192616 so are we talking about concept of rechargeable
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198282_0198846 what i was thinking of a design which nokia came up with almost six or seven years back
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198846_0199279 basically we have a flat one it looks like a box like a chocolate
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199279_0199946 that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they come up with something like this curved up so here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199946_0200218 and you do not bend your thumb too much
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200218_0200588 so it is like a banana shaped kind of thing curved up the boat
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200744_0201169 so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201249_0201901 so it is already curved up so you can have a molded according to your
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201997_0202359 the way you hold it it is kind of semicircular in the bottom
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0202482_0202746 i want to see exactly the same as the real one
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0206728_0206856 we could look at that part
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207096_0207273 what we were talking is to make it more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207410_0207989 rather than like seashells logo could become you could put a logo in the corner of a model
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207989_0208367 rather than trying to make it like a seashell or what you are telling me
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0209025_0209098 bener
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0211055_0211171 yeah we forgot to mention that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215455_0215628 yeah maybe we could commit some zip file
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215628_0216163 designs and then choose whichever appeals the most that could be the most common design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0216283_0216461 we can like think of vice exceptions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0226542_0226773 for being lost
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0229030_0229156 and different from what i was used to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232357_0232411 shnek
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232559_0232680 okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232928_0232967 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0000002_0000202 i will wait until you are online
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0005239_0005447 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008008_0008387 welcome back everybody i hope you have had fun
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008544_0009352 right this is our conceptual design meeting i think we are slightly ahead of ourselves
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0009477_0009969 from the last meeting yeah i was getting a question as well
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0010104_0011160 this is where we talk about properties materials user interface and trend watching
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011269_0011501 so i think we have touched on a few things
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011664_0011891 to that already but we will just go over it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012298_0012602 the minutes from last time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012602_0013372 we had a couple of changes in our plans in that you can use teletext
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0013372_0014280 it was not going to be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0014472_0016044 we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016044_0016539 we were thinking a shell but something along those lines just differentiate from what is normal
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016897_0017210 you are going to look into the rechargeable batteries
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017331_0017939 and we are going to think about the port and alarm for getting it lost things like that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017939_0018862 and our market was going to be young business kind of range
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0018862_0019193 okay so shall we start with the first presentation
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0019193_0019284 yes if you could
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0024946_0025060 it is coaching ai not it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0035729_0035965 okay thank you very much
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036149_0036391 let us start from the inside and work our way out
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036755_0036949 and the antitics
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0037104_0037309 yes thank you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0038856_0038972 i hate those little things
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0039096_0039596 especially if you do them on too tight and you can not get the leverage on them to undo them
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0049745_0049886 be honest people watch
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050012_0050260 wind up radio
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050494_0050799 how long can you get out there
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050799_0051223 i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053146_0053294 when you have got t shirts
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053378_0053790 oh so it is q v b z alright
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053961_0054086 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0055701_0055969 i am pretty sure that solar is from the sun
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056054_0056835 i do not think it counts electric lines now but i mean you do not want to limit your market
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056835_0057300 i mean people who live in basement flats there is not that many people but there are people
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058059_0058272 but then it would be charging to the day
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058272_0058872 i think the point is it charges through the day and then you have got it charged
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0059540_0059632 yeah i think
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064002_0064729 but then if you think about a watch it is on your wrist so it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064729_0065014 you are doing things it is moving a lot of time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065014_0065289 if you switch the tv on and you put it on the side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065289_0065588 yeah but
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065588_0065718 then again
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0068177_0068398 no
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0069823_0069960 do not you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071616_0071774 expensive as well
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071774_0072311 expensive
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0074029_0074161 the sun
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075002_0075156 yeah right
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075916_0076308 they do
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080189_0080629 okay can we add in an attachment to clothing feature
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080799_0080978 can we think about that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080978_0081433 because if we are doing the kinetic thing yeah i should not we do some research on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0081629_0081912 wel adi i ffeithio arno
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082370_0082509 where am i
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082509_0084553 if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape kinetic is something people do not do we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that leh
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084553_0084817 you would not lose it yeah so much
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084951_0085271 but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0085412_0085659 the eternal battle for control of the earth
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0087163_0087235 okay right
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091816_0091988 what kind of things do we have to consider there
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091988_0092807 can we what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0111147_0111276 for the flip side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117621 so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes off would be the rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0117621_0118084 it is like those pens that you get with a grip yeah right that you can pull with your arm
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0118872_0119263 although it is been really popular with mobile phones i do not see why not
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0129140_0129293 are we on speed limit yes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131235_0131449 i think it would be good to have a contrast between
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131449_0132237 it is a whole thing it is going to be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0132237_0132764 now how would you distinguish if you had it bare how would you distinguish where you had to press
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0134328_0134463 that you could pull out
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0135045_0135233 maen ddifrifol hefyd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137437_0137923 okay we will talk about that so if you finish here we will come back to that yeah that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137923_0138131 that is the end of the endless function
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144155_0144495 we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144866_0144989 well it is a remote control
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144989_0145772 you are sitting watching tv yeah are you gonna want to sort of open it and say
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0145952_0146152 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0148283_0148597 very quite posse
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0155824_0155938 graphic
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0160946_0161428 can we swap that round so that the ones that we use are on the bottom part
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161564_0161743 because if you are thinking about holding it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161877_0162283 you would be using your thumbs to press it is like a mobile phone
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0163533_0164442 that is what i was just saying and then have the lcd at the top and then be able to touch that for the other
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0164442_0165203 so it has the volume and the program things like that on the lower side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0175745_0176007 i can not see that is that playing stuff and things
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0176145_0176343 is that volume yeah volume and channel
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0179203_0179843 i am not sure how long i have got left but we need to make a decision about
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180107_0180200 the things we discussed
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180270_0180650 so we agree on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180781_0180899 did we agree on the battery
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181306_0181831 that means that there is no function for the port
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181831_0182425 you know that it sits in the pressing button and having so we could incorporate voice recognition yeah i think doing it i mean
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182425_0182687 it is a gadget
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182807_0182892 it is that neck point
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0184800_0184921 i think the only
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185031_0185833 i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185833_0186520 but i think pretty much we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0186520_0186655 as it is not tuned
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0187652_0187765 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0188079_0188197 i knew that would be good
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0189165_0189312 do you want like a backup
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191274_0191588 okay so we have got battery
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191588_0192062 the inside components is pretty standardized across the board is not it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192189_0192592 so there is not really a decision to be made there
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192808_0193128 the buttons what did you give us azza
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0193474_0193716 the bare board lcd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0194471_0194948 on the top one okay you have got the touch yeah okay and then
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0195625_0195847 okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0197336_0197415 nuts
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0198156_0198256 for the inside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0199200_0199392 oh i think so yes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0200704_0201858 no i think we do not want to be tacky if we have got a kind of different shape anyway the fact that the material that we would be using would be cheap
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0201858_0202008 so we could make it red
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202008_0202770 we could make it psychedelic we could make it black and white zebra stripes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202770_0203384 but that is not really what we are focusing on what we are focusing on is the you know the feeling yes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0203384_0203662 so we could just pick anything
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0205521_0206423 that is just different it is just different from everything else i mean i am trying to imagine clean looking houses
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0206423_0207105 sort of beige and black so you either want something that goes with that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207105_0207294 which is what is on the market anyway
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207294_0208360 or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0209428_0210011 and you would just have so many different options that you could do
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0210011_0210708 you could have a plain black one you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0211630_0212456 and the ones that have rubbery spikes you know you could just go so far with it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0212456_0213177 like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so i think that is quite flexible and finally the barracuda
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0215226_0215710 okay i have got five minutes um oh that might have been it for a while
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0222133_0222216 view
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0223557_0224476 well they do but i think we can it is the only one that is kind on the market well it is it is i think you just address that with advertising
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0224476_0225035 you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225035_0225419 obviously it will have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225419_0226057 the point is that it is got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does without that so i am not worried about that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0226877_0227640 depending on how yeah depending on the expense of it i mean we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into so
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0227763_0228698 that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive and we would have to cut down somewhere else then it is worth thinking about
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0228698_0229151 but i think we will find out more about cost afterwards
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229151_0229325 right we are going to wrap it up there
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229632_0230258 i have got an end meeting now
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0230519_0231255 so i think we have probably got it says closing we have forty minutes so i think we have probably got about that time before we come back
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231436_0231523 it is easier that way
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231623_0232110 we only had fourteen minutes to discuss what we just discussed and do not know how long that took
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0232570_0232677 is everyone happy
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0001757_0001913 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019124_0019210 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019333_0019451 just connect them
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0020110_0020144 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021791_0021898 thank you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021898_0022800 okay so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0022936_0023239 the methods we use to decide on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023460_0023678 current trends and so on market trends
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023678_0024933 rydyn ni wedi gwneud ein ymchwil ymgyrchun amlwg gydan one hundred o dynion y cyfathrebu cyffredinol or rhain yw yn ddiweddarach
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0024933_0025119 thanks for the coaching thanks for having me
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025119_0025656 rydyn ni wedi penderfynu ar y pethau pwysig mwyaf syn ei angen mewn debyg control ymhellach ac rydyn nin mynd ir hyn nesaf
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025656_0025849 so that was one of the first things we did
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025849_0026370 also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0026370_0026908 rydyn ni hefyd wedi edrych ar adnodd ffasiwn gan ein cynghorwyr ar dylunio ffasiwn yng nghymru a milan
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0027029_0028144 so the general findings from that was that in market trends the most important aspects for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028144_0028599 rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028599_0028955 they also want a remote control to be technologically innovative
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029089_0029420 and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029420_0029974 i should point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel is the most important
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029974_0030639 maen ddwyfais mor bwysig nar ddau technolegol newydd sydd yn ystod ddwyfais mor bwysig nar ffordd o ddefnyddion haws
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0030783_0031218 so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third it is still important
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031218_0031695 it is third in order of preference for the subject that we looked at
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031695_0032413 okay now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0032413_0033086 rydyn ni wedi cael cyfle in cynghorydd yng nghymru a milan syn cynghorydd yr unig ffasiwn a chynllunio
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033086_0033505 that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033505_0033912 so she could be thinking of using something like that in a remote control design too
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034013_0034785 there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials again in contrast to last year
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034785_0035432 so a lot of interesting feedback there both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0035432_0035654 be interesting to see what our design people make of that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036543_0036742 if anyone has any questions about that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036742_0036901 maria take six
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0039387_0039590 i read you a little bit on daily
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053232_0053491 when he is got a t binge
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053491_0053571 night
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053916_0053999 i̇şte bu
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056191_0056303 electric light
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056527_0056624 not many
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0057116_0057532 but there are people
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0068504_0069132 we are referring back to solar charging is that compatible with standard batteries
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069132_0069148 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069148_0069726 gallai bobl gael batriau cyffredinol yn ymwneud âr cymaint o bethau syn eu cymryd yn y llun fel y cyfleusodd prosorio ond maer ddau pethaun ddifrifol
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0071449_0071648 that is cool
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0076735_0076799 and the question is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0079650_0080160 it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature yeah i think it would
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0081231_0081853 a allwn ni wneud ymchwil ar hynnyn gyntaf cyn i ni ei roi rydyn nin ei roi i feddwl amdano
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0085715_0086369 it is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research it is not something that people are looking for
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086484_0086645 when you start off the battlefield
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086804_0087020 what do i need to put on the side to think about
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115209_0115444 it does not grow easily too if you let it fall
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115444_0115944 mae gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen dweud bod gen i ddau or llawer ond maen ddau or llawer ond maen ddau or llawer ond maen ddau or llawer ond maen ddau or llawer ond maen ddau or ddau
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115944_0116500 i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that is rubber yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0116500_0116979 gallwch chi ddod i mewn ir ffynion
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0117431_0117601 i will tweet and reply
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0118463_0118836 very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128514_0128876 also i do not see why the curve thing is a problem
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128876_0129431 if we for example had a show yeah oh it would be flat inside you could have a flat screen inside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0129595_0129708 bond just wondering whether
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0132981_0133449 i have got another idea i do not know if it helps with that but just to do with the rsi
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133449_0133915 is it possible just as an option when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133915_0134516 or we have inside a small pointer thing yeah you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0135041_0135232 maen ddifrifo hefyd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0136802_0137175 just a thought they would not actually need one in the case anything they have got could not they
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0137175_0137398 pencil or pen so they are not going to need a
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141328_0141902 just to raise another point that occurs to me it kind of applies to both our designers here to not she hold the tin
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141902_0142008 if we see glucan
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142008_0142721 now you know how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142721_0142795 do you see those
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142893_0143138 and they kind of respond to the turn of your body
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0143138_0144102 is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display or the remote control display then
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144533_0144638 and i do not know if i am doing this on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144773_0144835 just a thought
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145341_0145424 oh shit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145424_0146099 i am actually going to have a shower and do my hair before i put the tea up
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0146202_0146611 rydyn nin ceisio meddwl am ffeisiau eraill y gallwn eu hadneud yn y byd a ddim yn coes ar y bach
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0148117_0148530 dwin credu ein bod nin gweld eich bod chin gwblhau amdano
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0155760_0155881 i am sorry
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162257_0162492 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162703_0162747 would not it be
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162747_0162868 i think i do
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162868_0163243 if we just use the shell as an example you open that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0163243_0163660 you have got your lcd display there and you have got the buttons there that is what i was just saying
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0188370_0188958 iawn rydyn nin siarad am ffwrdd caniatig ond maen deimlo ein bod yn cymryd y peth hwnnw a wnaethom ddeimlo ar ddau e neu tri e faterion
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0189425_0190016 un or penderfyniadau rydyn nin cael ei wneud oedd y byddwn nin cael batriau aa neu aaa oherwydd maent yn rhaid iddo fod yn cael eu hyrwyddo yma oes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190016_0190091 ones come
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190507_0190607 okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190840_0191062 i want you on that one too
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0195977_0196170 so could you repeat that last one
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0196365_0196464 we felt it was playing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0198820_0199377 felly rydyn ni wedi ddechrau ar y casglu rhagl ar gyfer y sioe blastig
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0199597_0200180 and it is just always rubberised and spongy apart from that we are just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0200180_0200831 going to try and make actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203180_0203228 felly maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym maen dweud wrthym mae
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203764_0204429 is that going to be this image i have got in my head of something kind of shaped like that maybe about that size
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204429_0204917 maen gwneud o ddŵr maen cyflwyno i mewn ir pawb or ddŵr dŵr ysgafn syn sbwngi
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204917_0205635 is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted that is just different
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208230_0208684 iawn rydw in mynd ir ffordd y byddain dod allan gyda pheth arall ond rydw in cydweithion unig
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208684_0209080 we looked at those in watson i mean our kind of anonymous very similar looking thing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0209080_0209463 byddai hyn yn wahanol
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210551_0210871 the other rice cookers are going to be so relative they are cheap to produce
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210871_0211662 if in a year is time you get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it is so easy for us to produce that and it can be slipped on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0211662_0211788 i was going to
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0215644_0216382 for a while so can i just recap there for the decisions that we have made kinetic charging the watch type batteries
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216382_0216871 lcd display on the top side of the flip top
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216871_0217586 rubberised buttons on the bottom side we are going to use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover the case itself is plastic
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0217586_0217853 that is how far we have got what else do we have to add to our decisions
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219094_0219334 so are you looking at voice to speech
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219334_0219636 ond maen syniad da mae angen i ni ddweud wrth y cyfrifiadur
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0221703_0221964 i am incorporating the company logo
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0222656_0223061 because i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223061_0223585 nid ywn unig unrhyw fath o bobl syn gadael rhywfaint o ffynnydd ar y ffordd mae angen iddyn nhw fod yn amlwg bod yn rhyw ffynnydd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223838_0224119 you can not well it is it is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226150_0226432 did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a b print
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226432_0226842 rwyn credu bod hynnyn ymddangos yn y ffordd rydw i wedi siarad amdano roeddwn in ddweud y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y byddain ddiddorol y bydd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0230669_0230756 said
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0009601_0009826 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0036429_0036582 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0038097_0038352 and scream
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0041188_0042252 this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042252_0042507 okay first the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042623_0042742 into the method
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042742_0043948 the main idea of the whole thing is just so you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we discussed last meeting it should be easy to find
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0043948_0044473 also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0044473_0045055 because some of the things that we looked at last time unfortunately are not available
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045266_0045596 findings i have got my nice little picture there
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045596_0046596 this is the chip called the ta eleven thousand eight hundred thirty five which is what is used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0046596_0047486 based on your input and it is pretty much used for all tv remotes at the moment
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047486_0047853 and then we were looking into battery options
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047986_0048454 there is actually no rechargeable option available
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0048454_0049370 so i saw the standard aa and aaa which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0049370_0050219 dynamo charging i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest people what it is it is basically like wind up radio right
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050219_0050626 so you wind up your remote control before you use it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050626_0050702 كونوا قهل
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051215_0051688 yeah i presume you would not have to wind it for very long
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051688_0052412 but i do not think it is really necessary when you think of the next two options
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0052412_0053316 like the the solar charging because most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you have got tv
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053691_0053742 visit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053742_0053910 all right
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055103_0055725 yeah it would the dyno would take more space because you would actually need a physical handle to wind up
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055977_0056085 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0057514_0058039 yeah and most people also watch tv in the night
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0058725_0059062 i think the next one is the best anyway
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059062_0059834 the kinetic charging which is like you get it in wrist watches and you do not even notice it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059834_0060386 i mean the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would charge it up
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0060386_0060805 dydw i ddim yn meddwl y byddwch chin hoffin debyg i ddechrau ymgyrchun ffynedig i wneud y peth
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0061351_0062662 yeah it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the size of a watch a watch battery
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062662_0062874 because they use them quite frequently in watches
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062874_0064041 and that word would last for well i am not entirely sure how long it would last but i have never seen one run out
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0064990_0065140 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0065538_0066039 yeah but then again i think it is because if you think about it then what
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0066039_0067333 although it is only a tiny amount it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out overnight when you leave them on the side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067333_0067624 and for the same reason
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067624_0068678 you are only using it for an incredibly short amount of time just to send a signal and then you are finished with it so it is not the draw on it no no i do not think the draw on it would be
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0069582_0070774 maer ddau pethaun ddifrifol iawn gallwch gael pethaun ddifrifol ond y peth gydar cellau sôn yw eich bod angen eu rhoi ar y cas oherwydd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0070774_0071499 if you like on a calculator they they are quite they are quite big and they all they all look identical
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0071725_0071915 they are expensive
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0072299_0073132 yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i presume that then it would actually be the solar charging ones but the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073243_0073799 i think they are not very resistant to dropping
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073799_0074827 because if you drop stuff yeah if you have the size you would need to charge a remote it would not be that big but i mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0074990_0075189 i think like yeah practically
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0075365_0076057 i mean calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0076239_0076697 yeah they do they have got dual things but the batteries are smaller i think
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077618_0077833 about controlling
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077962_0078479 yeah if you had something using the standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078600_0078967 batteries and the solar charging
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078967_0079783 i do not think you would i think that it would well you know how long the standard double a is would last in or triple a is would last
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0079932_0080195 yeah i think it would
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087220_0087329 okay we will move on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087485_0088899 my second part of my findings the most current remotes use this silicon pcb board which prints circuit board
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0088899_0089550 which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0089550_0091768 it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this led in a sequence of on and off bursts
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0092714_0093013 well the thing about it is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0093157_0094354 they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print a circuit board like that it is simply spaced like that so you can fit the size of the nine buttons in
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094354_0094603 if you see how thin the tracks are
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094603_0095211 you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0095211_0096216 if you wanted to but there is an option to do it like that or you could have some sort
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096359_0096753 array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096908_0097666 and then to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode while not being used
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0097666_0098463 now i was thinking about that was because sometimes when you have these things they have got little lights on behind the buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0098463_0099218 so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone you do it more often than on a tv remote
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099218_0099999 but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would have that turned off
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099999_0100304 if we decided to go for buttons that could light up
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0100491_0101417 the case material i have been sent what the factory can actually give us
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0101417_0102327 the there is the plastic which i think we were going to go for anyway as the main case housing and
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0102459_0103250 the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0103250_0104324 titanium very expensive just the process to make it is expensive and rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0104324_0105188 well you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year so perhaps something made of rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105188_0105650 but i was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they have said
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105785_0106024 that they have put across
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106153_0106991 are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti rsi
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106991_0107867 i am not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0107867_0108482 and the problem with the casing is that there is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0108608_0109417 quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the cases
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109417_0109818 if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109818_0110496 whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do sort of curved shapes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0110496_0110920 but whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0111136_0111242 looking to the flip side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112321_0112383 yeah i
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112823_0113240 yeah in titanium i do not think it would be available at all really
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113240_0113765 the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113765_0114170 it is just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0114170_0115100 because of the expense of how much titanium is it is light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115243_0115311 sure
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115672_0115851 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116388_0116511 rubber yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116863_0117008 and she can peel them off
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0119373_0120482 also just going back to the interface design with the buttons we were planning to do some sort of touch screen
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0120482_0121957 now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare pcb circuit board and i am sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122071_0122465 over if you had them close enough that would be one option
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122465_0122835 the second option they offer rubber versions
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122835_0123831 but i thought that an lcd type of screen because one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0123831_0124958 two you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing you could have them like a touch
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125432_0125558 uh what
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125910_0127015 oh on the lcd screen you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it is flat and so you can not do lots of curved things with it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127015_0127827 but you would not have with the lcd you would have the wires coming off you would not have that with the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127940_0128210 with the lcd you would only have that with the printed circuit board
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0128504_0128659 also with the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129264_0129906 you could have a flat screen inside yeah but i am just wondering whether we want an lcd screen inside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129906_0130571 it would not be like full colour it would just be black and white but there would be touch touch buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0130571_0131188 so you would not be pressing down or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti rsi
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0131618_0131678 gross
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0132839_0133139 yeah i had not really thought that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134130_0134192 yeah he could
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134192_0135048 you could have some sort of stylist that you could pull out but i think they could get a bit easily lost
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0136768_0136855 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0137738_0138096 yeah that is the end of the piece
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0138991_0139069 i thought that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139363_0139573 yeah yeah that would be fairly simple
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139573_0140740 mean you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0140740_0141112 because in the actual flip you would have some linking
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0146938_0147093 i mean you can not you could do it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147093_0147921 you could have a because if you just put the full charge through an lcd display it will completely blank it out
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147921_0148233 but i do not know if you can get any mirror effect on it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0156418_0156912 yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen and this lcd screen like
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0163508_0163805 that is what i was just saying
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0174354_0174537 well yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182295_0182473 yeah i think
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182707_0183573 yeah it is it is quite a cool feature to have and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0183573_0184148 then it will not be cheap to remanufacture it will be cheap sorry to remanufacture
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184148_0184662 so do you reckon that is a good idea about where is the remote i am here thing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184662_0184793 i think that would be quite fun
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0186500_0187432 as it is not cheap well it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour because if you have just got a black and white one
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0187432_0187668 and they use them on calculators
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189054_0189228 what
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189926_0190502 no the kinetic ones come with a battery that goes in the watch
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0190615_0190857 felly maen ddifrifol iawn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0193636_0194134 yeah i think we are going for the lcd on the buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0194134_0194770 on the top one on the top one okay you have got the touch yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0195004_0195515 on the bottom we are going to have the rubber ones the anti rsr ones
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0196178_0197020 okay on the flip screen the top one is going to be the lcd and the bottom one is going to be the rubberised part
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0198019_0198162 plastic
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0200605_0200649 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0212137_0212251 you could just ghost
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0214132_0215132 yeah yeah with these rubber these rubberized not the actual plastic outside case just the rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0220154_0220323 oh yeah yeah the whistle will not
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0226986_0227165 yeah depending on the expense of it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0227609_0227779 i think i have got him stopped
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0229935_0229994 de
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0008247_0008327 love you guys
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0036430_0036499 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054083_0054598 regarding the sizes which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration size also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054598_0055216 so maybe it is standard aaa might take less space and dynamo might take more space yeah it would
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0060854_0061353 and what is the life of the kinetic battery it runs for a long time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0064027_0064066 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0071528_0071765 it would be expensive as well
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0072058_0072205 presuming it took normal back
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076724_0076992 another question is like sorry
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076992_0077461 which one would last the longest because we do not want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0077596_0077934 or remote control like so yeah so look at the light
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111124_0111763 so the flip side yeah and second question is like mobile you can change the color yeah color the skin or whatever
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111763_0112363 so in this case if you are looking at like the customer can change the color like from green red green to chili red or something like that yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0112363_0112923 is that feature available in titanium or it is only specific to plasma
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117608_0117718 like those pens
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117973_0118068 that could be a good idea
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0118192_0118395 it would be comfortable to hold on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125060_0125310 so it is required a last part
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125566_0125997 just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0134989_0135328 i believe i will give the cat a reply for this one
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0135328_0136485 a person who switches channels very often or does reuse a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use it you know and he might spoil your touchpad very fast compared to a button like
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0136485_0136741 if you keep punching with a point over
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138042_0138503 there was one small issue before like you are discussing regarding the circuit since we are having a flip top
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138503_0139147 yeah customize the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top oh yeah complex buttons in this thing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0139147_0139304 so we can divide the circuit like this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148592_0148738 오케이
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148998_0149237 to share something which i did here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149237_0149677 first thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149677_0150290 especially for the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibilities
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150290_0150802 second is we checked into competitors the picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150802_0151570 so you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy they are bored of black and white
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0151570_0152116 so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152292_0152729 and second thing is there is too much of confusion here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152729_0152905 इसके लिए नहीं है परिक्लोर रिमोट पर प्रश्चान
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153118_0153286 like some people have
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153441_0153591 hugh you see this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153591_0153741 this is on uh i 
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153858_0154292 i found that the only common feature is the channel control and the volume control
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154292_0154798 rest other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models and all
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154928_0155214 okay and second as already discussed with william
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0155214_0156212 we are going to have maybe a gui interface in the middle of the flip top and a graphic user interface basically which is what we do in computer
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156212_0156505 have icons or touchpad or whatever
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156891_0157538 like you have on icons or something you have is a good example of gui graphic user interface
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0157634_0157921 so basically a person need not point or click on it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158012_0158431 press any particular device he just has to click on that particular icon i will just simplify
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158431_0159281 and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means use of button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159281_0159776 so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel a person is frequent surfing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159878_0160312 so we are having a combination of both so on the simpler board
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0160312_0160780 on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164344_0164499 okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164949_0165076 on the lower
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165076_0165165 no thanks
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165562_0165774 so the findings are too many click buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165863_0166384 repetition of certain patterns which i already explained in example the volume and channel control buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166384_0166613 all are confusing and inconsistent
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166613_0166912 okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a main
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167049_0167557 which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167557_0168273 we have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0168273_0169125 but for like we had a response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169125_0169527 so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers i am here yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169527_0170446 some kind of thing or it gives a blep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170446_0170664 and technologically innovative also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170898_0171243 so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0171623_0172153 my personal preferences would be like as already highlighted by marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172153_0172555 they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172555_0173179 but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors red chili
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0173301_0174236 tomato red or whatever and second thing is certain standard buttons we should have like for example if you see the previous slide
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0174609_0175151 i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0175151_0175720 so we will not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176016_0176429 this is the central one oh it is that volume and channel
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176429_0177106 so keep that standardized because that is the most common feature across all models if you look at all the models it is here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0178082_0178157 voice recognition
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0181014_0181081 comment
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0187746_0187925 maybe we could start with the black and white
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0188073_0188307 yeah that would be good yeah upgrade later on up
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197144_0197260 and for the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197709_0198266 for the body design i think plastic plastic yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0198266_0198782 for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0199172_0199264 i think
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0205544_0205727 it is just different
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0212288_0212491 like a
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213084_0213742 and finally the body should be detachable maybe you can change the body of the case casing the case outside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213742_0214102 it should be molded with the design in such a way you can change it every time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0214919_0214966 did it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0218025_0218991 fine we are talking about voice recognition also because that we have not addressed the issue of how to locate a remote control if it is lost
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219083_0219306 so are you looking at voice with the test sheet
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219578_0219981 or maybe like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on keychains
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220136_0220425 oh yeah yeah the whistle one the whistle
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220425_0220813 so we can financially voice recognition is not visible we could go for a whistle
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0222260_0222540 so i mentioned but purely incorporating in the design
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0230257_0230355 again a question now
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0232171_0232396 i think we are pretty going in a clear direction now
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0000368_0000686 if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0001995_0002074 check
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002393_0002526 and three apparently
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002738_0002856 okay i will switch then
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003272_0003390 you will get to go
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003390_0003552 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003664_0003952 minutes we decided to use a kinetic charger
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004093_0004564 standard chips as it can come in various different sizes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004709_0004997 going to be a problem factor
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004997_0005194 we wanted a standby function
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005194_0005672 the case interiors can be soft rubbery changeable
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005672_0006122 buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber according to the design
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006122_0006812 bright funky designs inspired by a very keeping with the hip kind of feel
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006812_0007631 and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0007631_0008203 and the rubber buttons that we will use will be anti rsi
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0008858_0009029 prototype presentation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0009260_0009381 i think that would be you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010325_0010586 do you want to hold it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010901_0010995 yes yes you can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010995_0011086 i do not get it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012537_0012988 stefano is things you can just take it on
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012988_0013135 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0014172_0014215 all right
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0020953_0021050 and the buns
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0021493_0021601 alright have a look
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0023326_0023877 so put it in the top section rather than the bottom section yeah because it is the top yeah okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027237_0027350 that is some anti s 
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027464_0027593 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0032909_0032972 はい
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033289_0033662 actually no it would be your temple yeah on your front your front side of that yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033662_0033840 alright yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033980_0034152 so when you have actually got to open it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0034235_0034335 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0039904_0040303 but not interfering with my product
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041343_0041510 thank you very much
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041653_0041912 just racking it all up okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041912_0042199 i have now got evaluation criteria
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0042707_0043170 귀여워
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0045226_0045415 it is quite similar to what it was before though
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0058297_0058533 just right smarley
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0060141_0060204 next
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0063692_0063765 i would agree
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0064951_0065004 i will see you tomorrow
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0069602_0069659 a two
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0072117_0072286 it is just two point five for that one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0075853_0076076 i would say it too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0076076_0076158 that is it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077244_0077443 one point says delete this file
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077443_0077562 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0087136_0087889 well the type of button that we are going to use in the bottom half the material that mysosarosites are meant to
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088191_0088855 maybe because with the size that we have got it is quite small but with the amount of separate putty on it it is not that much
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088855_0089231 so maybe because there is more space it is not kind of moving around to an
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089313_0089572 okay accurately the buttons in between
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089572_0089900 it is quite obvious just big buttons
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0095822_0095902 understand yourself
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096148_0096209 it would be
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096383_0096845 and if you did not hear it in the room you were standing in and you realised it was not in that room you go into another room
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102140_0102218 i do not think so
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102431_0102558 i should meet you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102558_0102627 i took small
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0103784_0104040 too much apart from having a huge big
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105024_0105081 take care so long
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105433_0105566 okay thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106383_0106722 okay i have got finance here now
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106722_0107058 i am going to plug this in so you can all see it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111261_0111373 now i presume
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111556_0111672 that scream of goodnight
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111791_0111963 that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0112668_0113201 we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113201_0113484 so i was still on for kinetic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113715_0113995 see it would have been handy to have this at the beginning
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113995_0114217 it might have influenced our choice
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0114509_0114789 right what is happening with the electronics
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0115794_0115886 amen
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117120 oh right okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117520_0117628 so would there be two
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117973_0118028 one chick
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119130_0119210 one leprechaun
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119730_0119868 so what is the single curve
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0120288_0120438 so just one job
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0121644_0122034 we have got plastic and rubber
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0123290_0123329 interesting
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0124483_0124648 it would be like saying we are using
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125074_0125261 see it says case material
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125385_0125843 so we are not actually using plastic in the case
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125843_0126008 it is including it is including
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0127840_0128124 okay we will just put it in his we will put it in his hair
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128357_0128636 we should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128938_0129220 when we are doing stuff leaning on the tubes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129220_0129394 okay special color do we need that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129643_0129734 diolch yn fawr iawn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138235_0138315 うつむかな
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138315_0138673 oh no it was seven   five it is changed
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0139863_0140057 it is not calculating
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140280_0140355 okay there we go
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140434_0140639 and slightly
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0141642_0141956 we have not been dealing with dollars though
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142112_0142400 okay so the highest we have got is the electronics here
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142723_0142945 if we add the interface
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146296_0146349 where is the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146444_0146567 where is the vise recognition
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146864_0146956 right
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147212_0147361 well a kinetic is three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147361_0147641 if we change it to batteries that is minus three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148023_0148079 all right
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148079_0148241 hypsyncians
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148868_0149309 we can do it some other way it does not have to be voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0149309_0150037 we could do the voice recognition for business class or something like an upgraded version of the show
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0150037_0150218 you could choose to have or not
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0151326_0151659 so should we just change it to christmas
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154493_0154605 okay we can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154748_0155625 make the price fit and then say if we had our budget we would have had this because it also sets it apart
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0155625_0156026 they like their gadgets they like something that is completely different
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156026_0156347 it is something completely different associated with your company
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156347_0156467 right okay so
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157505_0157721 was it twelve point five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157721_0157907 no it is twelve point two five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158190_0158482 yeah well two twelve point two five times two is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158669_0158815 twenty five are they going to
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0160463_0160841 the agenda one was where the price was was not it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162262_0162338 twelve point five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162645_0162720 now jump people
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163089_0163418 so is that got us covered for the electronics thing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163418_0163680 we do not need something else to take that place
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0165733_0165921 right done that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166372_0166561 product evaluation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166692_0166948 we have done room for creativity have not we
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166948_0167513 because we have got decisions that we would have made that we were not did not feel able to make
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0167748_0167997 i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168536_0168736 in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168915_0169188 did you feel like a team
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0169188_0169806 or did you feel like i would say as a team
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173184_0173296 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173296_0173446 how did you find it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0176832_0177869 i like the fact that we could say an idea and it be suggested that it was not the best idea but no one felt like shot down
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0177869_0178399 you know it did not matter saying what you thought because if it was not something that was that relevant
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178399_0178669 and it did not matter because it was just another idea
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178669_0178828 i do love that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179060_0179486 well you two created that wonderful specimen of a play doh model
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179596_0180250 i think that was the best part of the trip i am still not caught up
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0180250_0180551 that is nothing to do with the teamwork at all
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181444_0181597 yeah that was quite fun
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181597_0182055 means whiteboard digital pens etc what does that mean
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0182055_0182133 adios
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0183562_0183667 had time to kind of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184151_0184614 yeah because we could just sort of say sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184614_0184842 other than having to email you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184842_0184984 but it was nice having it there
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0185103_0185350 like the whole picture of the thing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0189996_0190296 yeah i think it is the idea of joining from other areas
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191575_0191709 yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191709_0191888 well they have to come from somewhere
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192020_0192299 i was but sorry good
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192299_0193197 as was shown by your presentation with all of the other remote controls no one has thought about it particularly
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193197_0193678 i mean they are slightly different so if someone is been shut in a room and said my car is a bit different from everyone else is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193678_0194216 because there is something we should think about but obviously no one is put any great deal of thought into it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196176_0196984 but then when everything is really smart and you have just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table it does not go
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196984_0197713 i mean if you could have something that is a proper funky thing a funky item that is individual individual to you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0197713_0198494 i mean they could even go into you go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0198494_0199206 you would pay a lot extra because it is individually being a plastic was being made for you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199206_0199556 but people could have anything that they wanted
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199712_0199792 present
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0203973_0204308 well it is innovation for money is sake
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204308_0204544 that people have to keep forcing it onto people
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204806_0205290 and you can get you have got your handset that works fine but you can not get battery anymore for that type of phone
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205290_0205582 because the phones had moved on things like that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205778_0205904 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206223_0206361 in closing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206460_0206619 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206619_0207514 our costs are below budget with recommendations that the budget be increased but i think i do not know what do you think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0207514_0207752 i think that takes into account
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208156_0208471 like us being well paid kind of thing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208471_0208983 and the heating for the building do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209312_0209994 so it looks like it is going to be fifty percent profit you have still got all of the overheads to come out of that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209994_0210623 so maybe increasing it you would also have to increase the price they sold it maybe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0210623_0210881 i think but you were saying that that is quite
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213317_0213646 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213646_0213744 maybe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213744_0213984 you know you are so cute
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214271_0214736 the project has been evaluated well and truly
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214736_0215214 and you have got the meeting summary and questionnaire
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215214_0215890 right so we have got about fifty minutes to catch up to everything that i fell behind with
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215890_0216450 so i will be delegating my role as project supervisor so good luck
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0216954_0217203 i think the celebration is at twenty five pounds
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0217288_0217464 there i will be dancing on the dance floor

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219619_0219703 the last thing you can do
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0222167_0222225 i have just got
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0001511_0001599 so
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0026214_0026708 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0041713_0041806 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0042882_0042934 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0042934_0043055 cheerium
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0045600_0046975 yn ystod y cyfrifoldeb maen wir i ni fel tîm gyrraedd cyfrifoldeb os ydyn ni wedi cael cyfnod o ddifrifoldeb a dylunio prototair cyfrifoldeb syn cydnabod y cyfrifoldeb a gafodd gael ei ddod on ymchwil byd
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0046975_0047249 dymar cyfan gyntaf ar y cyfrifiad
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047249_0047547 the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047547_0048158 o ran y cyfrifoldebau ar trefnau ar gael ar y cyfrifoldebau ar strategaethau cymdeithasol ein cymdeithasol
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048158_0048619 so it is what we have discussed in the last meeting are we actually meeting those trends and requirements
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048836_0049116 now the findings that we came up with just to recap are here
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049116_0049991 the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel technological innovation it should be easy to use
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049991_0050845 byddain golygu cyfrifoldeb ffasiwn ar hyn o bryd ac maer ddau ffasiwn yma yn ystod y texture spongy ar ffrut ar ffres ar gyfer coloedd dylunio
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0050845_0051764 the design should minimise rsi and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0051764_0052317 oherwydd roedd hynnyn ymddangos fel strategaeth ffavoreth ond roedd hefyd ar y rhan or ffyrdd o gael ffynoneb fwyaf
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052504_0052880 iawn felly gallwn ni ddod yn ôl ir slid hwnnw os nad oes gennych ystyried y rhain
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052880_0053466 fe wnawn ni ddangos sut y byddwn nin mynd i arwain ein cymorth ir cyfarfodydd hyn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053466_0053913 we are going to use a seven point scale where one is true and seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053913_0054337 we will look at each of those criteria that i have just mentioned i will pull that slide back up
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054337_0054894 and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054894_0054982 y is dat sin plin
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054982_0055080 any questions
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055241_0055377 felly byddwn yn edrych ar y rhain
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055519_0056226 yeah we are going to come to we will discuss each one and we will come to our consensus rating between one and seven okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056226_0056304 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056304_0056520 one is true seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056932_0057098 ben bunu böyle fonda kaptım
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057098_0057436 just be criteria one two three four five six or a b d
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057436_0057767 a c d e f to compute it with binary
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057767_0058075 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0058075_0058416 it is where i do all the things i am not allowed to do

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0059577_0060022 actually it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating and put it in the end
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0060022_0060152 yeah i will say
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0060278_0060896 felly rwyn mynd ir rhain ir rhan fwyaf or wythnosau ac os ydyn nin mynd i un ddau tri ffyrdd rydyn nin gwybod

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0084803_0085294 moving on to does the design minimize visual strain
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0085499_0085694 i did not mean to touch the moon
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0085694_0086008 we discussed it we have not really come up with anything
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086156_0086309 em várias vidas
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086309_0086708 we talk about quantity but the very use of it or allow control if you are someone who is that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086708_0087178 well the time
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0089981_0090294 i think i am going to have to do neutral again
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0090814_0090958 see you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0091194_0091503 cool

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0092947_0093561 yeah it was
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0093733_0094033 voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094033_0094237 i will never have this costume
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094237_0094433 yeah yeah but

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0094641_0095029 i go for we can adjust the volume on that just as we can to the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0095216_0095536 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0096324_0096449 and if you did

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0098073_0098582 still i have a few buttons
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0098582_0099508 so we have got the highest rating of meeting the specification that is definitely true for two of the six criteria here
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0099508_0100102 that incorporates current fashion trends and will be easy to locate
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0100102_0101119 the lower strength we have got which is really not terribly low it is close around neutral is for minimisation of repetitive strain injury
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0101119_0101757 rydyn nin teimlo ar y cyfrifoldeb or adnoddau yma y gallwn ni fynd ymlaen a chael eu cyfrifoldeb fel argyfwng ar gyfer y cyfrifiadau
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0101757_0101958 to you too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0102343_0102440 yeah i like it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0102690_0103123 i think the most frustrating thing is finding out that the other end is still this quiet
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0103123_0103201 wait
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0103308_0103946 on the basis of current technology and our current capability can actually do much
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104035_0104199 and
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104279_0104500 well i hope that is clear to the team
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104500_0104817 is there anything you would like to ask me about it babe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104928_0104965 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0105269_0105357 i am me

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0107225_0107291 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0119481_0119693 maer gwaith yn ychydig yn fflat ac yn y ddewis felly gallain gweithio
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0119693_0119769 so what is the point
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0119933_0120168 bydd y botom yn llawn gydar un cyrnod
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0120168_0120283 i am gonna tell our fingers
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0121063_0121404 maer arfer yn y cyrfedd ar y ffyrdd ond maen ychydig yn fflaenor ar y ddewis felly dydyn ni ddim yn mynd ymlaen
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0124069_0124247 beth ywr syniad wrth i chi roi zero point five i hynny
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0125948_0126093 including
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0126728_0127172 ond maen rhaid i ni fod yn rhan or costau cyflawn a dyna lle na allwn ni ei roi
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0127172_0127484 there is nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0127484_0127676 so do we not have to account for it in the course somewhere though
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0129433_0129934 might do figure out if it is something more exotic corbrichons and such like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0137735_0138224 if you click off that square now does that not make any difference
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138224_0138383 was that on going up oh no it was seven
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138626_0139126 maen gwirioneddol iawn ond gwneud y casglau rhwbeth yn gwirioneddol yn gwneud gwahaniaeth
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0139563_0139785 that is not my dad is ring then
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0140346_0140507 i am going to write it down slightly
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0141636_0141773 we have not been dating
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142747_0142880 if we actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142988_0143645 if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries would that make a huge difference
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0145029_0145509 people are used to me being a cheater i am just saying you are getting us in a lot of trouble
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0146166_0146338 do we see what difference it makes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151180_0151459 but we are still working to so should we just change it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151568_0151710 in our recognition
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151710_0152186 os ydym yn gweithio i ddod allan or sbesifegiadau dyma beth maer rhaglen hon yn ei weithio ar
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152186_0152756 we can put in our recommendations for what we have found and the consensus that we have come to as a result of the meetings
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152756_0153037 but we need to work to that specification to start
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153037_0153309 and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153309_0153981 ond mae ein cyflwyniad mor ddiddorol a byddai hyn yn gwneud ei leihau iw leihau iw leihau yn y cyfnod cyntaf
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153981_0154491 fel y dweudwch gallwn gynhyrchur cyhoeddiad y gofyn ir cyfrifoldeb byd draweithiol
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0155506_0155799 because we have done all the background work
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0156540_0156796 so if we take voice recognition out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0157258_0157321 workloads
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0157989_0158071 you soon

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0169656_0170315 i think we had a nice i think we had a nice there was so much interaction so much that we needed to find out from each other find out from each other
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0170315_0171238 and i certainly felt heard listened to and that in relevant areas we have been able to give and take and adjust our remit in bruness
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0180677_0181283 maybe we should think of branching out into children is toys maybe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0181283_0181419 in fat eye tea

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0190483_0190922 i mean nothing is new but it is applying it to a different area
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0191831_0191944 yn siŵr
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0196007_0196202 yeah the dvd player
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201108_0201817 i think it is really good that this has been very market research based because just going back to mobile phones
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201817_0202407 dymar newid cyntaf i ddefnyddior deunyddau cyffredinol y gallaf ei ddweud ywn amlwg an gweld
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202407_0202851 rydyn nin gweld hwn yn ffônau cyfansoddol yn lawer ac dyna lle rydyn ni wedi cymryd llawer o syniadau
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202851_0203137 there are innovations in that that people do not really want
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203137_0203687 mae pobl yn eisiau model or ffôn rydyn nhwn hapus iawn ac nid ydynt yn gallu ei gael arall maen brofiad ar gyfer brofiad
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203687_0203961 and i think it is wonderful that our company is so r and d based
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204421_0204579 forcing it onto people
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204579_0204892 things that you know they might want to buy the thing they really can not get
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205457_0205662 i thought it was a cover to fit it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205906_0205983 and
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0208960_0209296 i think it was just the product i think that was just the physical
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0210855_0211119 i think in the remit that you were given it was very specific
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211119_0211269 i think we have done what we are required to do
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211269_0211781 and i think there will have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at those kind of things
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211781_0212244 i do not think that is something we have to look at to find a way of raising the cash for
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0212398_0213152 you have done very well to get within budget and still make such an innovative item that i think people are really going to want
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213477_0213648 good will
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213648_0213692 maybe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213692_0214036 i am going to deal with that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0219792_0219958 it is tindle
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0220084_0220492 wel nid oedd yn rhaid i mi ddweud i chi sut rydych chi wedii gynhyrchur cyfarfodydd yma
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221077_0221151 i am right
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221151_0221379 ond ydym ni ddim yn ymwneud âr cyfarfodydd hwn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009137_0009262 something for us
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009949_0010093 yeah should i show
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010093_0010200 that is true
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010200_0010830 do you wanna hold it i will show you the presentation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010830_0010982 can i just make it yes yes you can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0011655_0011774 i am trying to reprise it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0012076_0012140 간지
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0013863_0014453 okay so this is our look and feel presentation our final presentation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0014453_0015093 and we will first look at the exterior of what we have come up with over there
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015277_0015894 it is going to have a plastic body with a sort of standard colour like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015894_0016555 we are thinking something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0016555_0017582 this is underneath the rubberised outer casing which there would be sort of a wide choice they would be attached
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017582_0017838 but we can come up with it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017838_0018731 y pethau o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ddewis a phattern felly mae gennych llawer o gwreiddiadau gyfaddef
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0018731_0020259 um it is obviously in a sort of clamshell design and uh the um the top lcd screen you can see there would would be so um
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020371_0020670 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020670_0021549 y byddain ymgyrchun y tos ac y byddair barn ar y gwres yn llwyr
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021549_0021771 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021771_0022666 and working on the inside with already said decided on the kinetic batteries which actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0022666_0023422 thinking about it now you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get it in the top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0023993_0024362 we decided that the voice recognition system
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024362_0024997 ac yn dweud yma mewn e bwysedd y byddent yn dod i mewn ac roeddent yn eithaf eisiau i gael ymddangos
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024997_0025272 so we presume that that also be quite cheap
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025272_0025780 so you would have something like where you would shout out what areas to remove
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025911_0026127 it will shout back i am here or something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026345_0026723 i am saying yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026723_0026955 it will not shout out i am here or something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026955_0027532 it was just a chat i did or something too similar
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0027532_0028157 yeah if it was getting like well that could be something for next time maybe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028157_0028476 you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028476_0029174 the standard transmission with the tv using all the standard chips that we have talked about
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029174_0029767 it would have obviously because it is split over two different layers
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029767_0030462 it would need two separate pcb is that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0030462_0031657 and because obviously all tv is use this the same infrared medium we would just be using the same thing to transmit the data
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031657_0031836 and the infrared
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031988_0032552 the sender would be on the on one of the bottom layers
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0032552_0032972 just at the front of the i do not think we ever did it on
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033080_0033210 yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033420_0033651 yeah only your front your front side
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033990_0034391 so when you have actually got it open it will be facing the tv
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034391_0034801 and then finally the int space
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034801_0035814 the top screen as we have said this would be an inset black and white lcd touch screen which yeah would
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0035930_0037058 have all of all of the available functions for for the remote on it whereas the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0037058_0038061 like the volume up and down channel up and down power on and off and things to that effect
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0038061_0039089 and now we also decided on the inside we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezel
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0039240_0039783 logo on it or something insert or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040004_0040229 no not actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040229_0040867 no not interfering with the whole look of the product when it is out on the thing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040867_0041709 and finally that is how we put the fashion back into electronics thank you very much
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0042881_0043105 감사합니다
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0060100_0060169 yeah i will save it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0063870_0064567 yeah i would probably put it two or three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0064567_0064642 dementia
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066278_0066375 i am just
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066839_0066952 yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0068639_0068737 i would give it a one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0069005_0069175 no no not at all
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080119_0080264 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080340_0081046 na na y mewn gwahoddiad oedd yn hawdd
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0081046_0082045 ond bydd y ffasïau newid yn eich gallu cael unrhyw un or nifer o ffasïau mewn ffurf o ffurf or ffurf
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082154_0082482 yeah yeah yeah i have had enough
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082589_0083208 no no that is the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you have got around it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083208_0083491 that otherwise it is just plastic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083801_0083950 yeah i think they are the ones
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0087592_0087662 minimizes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0090559_0090965 yeah i would go for a five actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0093454_0093931 yeah it was a voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0094276_0094535 yeah yeah that is yeah that is cheesy
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095126_0095345 i think it did
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095602_0096244 i think it would probably be a standard it would be quite loud it would be
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0096244_0096449 and if you did
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097153_0097308 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097680_0098250 i do realise that we now feel unfathomably biased
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0102290_0102604 i think yeah i like it i think yeah yeah i think so
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0114834_0115187 there is regular chetian on print around
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0115809_0115964 oh no no no
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116133_0116678 yeah it is you have put in three for the number of kinetic cells so it should just be one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116802_0117113 in the top it is the number oh right okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0117466_0117955 so would there be two
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118064_0118366 yeah one of them and one sample sensor and sample speed
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118818_0118949 no do not charles
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119293_0119443 too because it is filthy lousy
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119850_0120257 ie rydw in dweud byddain ddod yn dda iawn gyda un cwm ie rwyn credu
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120464_0120574 one double cone
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120693_0121171 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0121776_0121846 let us go
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0122318_0122413 maybe a red flag car
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0125714_0125931 no no that is it is including
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0126045_0126679 so that should not that should not be actually on there because that is not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0128633_0128764 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0130421_0130825 yeah the push buttons one and lcd display one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0131134_0131227 but
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0138203_0138312 let us talk about
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139752_0139857 go on again
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139938_0140207 no you have got to click off the can can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0140518_0141065 you might be assuming that that is in euros
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141065_0141279 it could have been dollars
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141279_0141927 then we would be fine because the exchange rate would not get we have not been dealing with dollars though
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0143648_0144016 you understand it it would make one difference
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144016_0144324 the biggest one would be taken away if you took away
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144543_0144579 so next
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145099_0145444 if you take away the voice i do not know what to say
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145444_0145718 if you take away the voice recognition then you have got it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146347_0146418 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146418_0146869 where is the voice recognition it is samplesense samplespeaker
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146869_0147206 right okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0147540_0148015 minus three yeah but you minus three plus two
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150154_0150760 but i mean i do not see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150760_0151132 because they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0152684_0152856 we need to work to that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0153005_0153128 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154713_0154772 yeah i like that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154997_0155203 we had our chance
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0156794_0157060 so i will do it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157060_0157389 trochę ja wykluczyłem oczy
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157389_0157688 is it twelve point five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0163776_0164224 because that was just a bolt on x ray you could just take that out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0164377_0164535 und wie vorhin
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0165505_0165598 thanks
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0169504_0169624 i would say it is a t
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0170117_0170307 find out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173464_0173955 yeah no i thought it went really well and i yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173955_0174893 i feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seemed to have been sorted out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0174893_0175366 though we did not quite make the voice recognition in there but that is good yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0175366_0176275 i think it would have made it into the final product if we would seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0176275_0176799 ac rwyn meddwl efallai byddai wedi dod yn wahanol
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0179518_0179601 huh
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182025_0182333 jesus christ what have you done
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182963_0183503 yeah i think we probably would have used the actual email system more had we actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0183706_0184183 had had more time and if we would been separated more
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0193972_0194451 no one is put any great deal of thought into it i do not think the companies are really concerned
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194451_0194929 they are just like we have got a dvd player does anyone remember their own control
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194929_0195222 can not you get the one that we used for the last one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195222_0195447 yeah just jazz it up a bit
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195447_0195953 they do not really think about it because normally the remote control is not the product which they are trying to ship
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195953_0196277 they are trying to ship the dvd player video player tv
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0209117_0209327 i think that was just the physical
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0210588_0211064 i think but you are saying that is quite well i think in the remit that you were given it was very
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0212327_0212444 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213821_0213994 i am so excited
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213994_0214279 what is this conspiracy going on
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0214279_0214376 yes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0216025_0216367 i am the role as project supervisor
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0218350_0218423 you just have it then
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0220460_0220881 was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you would done in your
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221156_0221346 ond a ydym ni ddim weithion amlwg yn ymwneud âr cyfansoddiadau hyn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221346_0221542 yeah that is yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221542_0221919 i think yeah question seven was the one i did just before the movie
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002299_0002344 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002906_0002963 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0009468_0009897 me and william worked on a prototype and i think william is going to make a presentry fan
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010362_0010480 i will reply
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010605_0010822 yeah i will show you the presentation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0011596_0011657 oops
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0012565_0012623 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0013210_0013453 oh that is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0015304_0015388 it is gonna have a
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0020479_0020798 yeah yeah it would be so in
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0027429_0027532 oh that would be too good
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033228_0033450 actually no it would be you would have to
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033450_0033533 the affront
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033648_0034164 oh right yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0035666_0035739 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0039896_0039971 but not into the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0040482_0040557 누가
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0042426_0042675 so this is the one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0044834_0045037 i think this was a good shit
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055079_0055182 i am sco 
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055336_0055621 is it everybody is going to evaluate or just the one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0060095_0060228 yeah that is what you do
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0065308_0065495 how pitiful
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066323_0066378 on the street
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066756_0066816 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0069892_0070123 what is so great about it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070123_0070298 the first one reading i am sorry
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070298_0070429 can you just make it two
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070543_0070603 yep plus
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070603_0070757 yeah i just thought it does
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070898_0070995 and eat
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0071117_0071242 yep i just got
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072069_0072130 bye
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072878_0073085 and he has a good show of self
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080695_0080800 the point of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080800_0080861 oh bye
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0082600_0082771 no no it is advanced
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0083007_0083114 because you did it wrong
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0093601_0093754 voice
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0107878_0108004 i need to unplug that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0109655_0109698 to
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0115001_0115080 chip on print
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119093_0119208 sing one double care
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119371_0119432 still be lovely
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120299_0120367 so just one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120773_0120865 because one of the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122178_0122445 that is tickle one and maybe a red wine colour
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122756_0123099 i think rubber since it is being used just as a casing we can put zero point five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123349_0123443 yeah cause it will
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123549_0123800 i think it allows you to pump something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123800_0123894 you can use that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124252_0124459 means we are not using a lot of rubber actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124459_0124535 it would be like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124679_0124956 a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0130211_0130272 push button
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137174_0137358 you could change the battery
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137358_0137594 instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard particle
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139161_0139263 and go for that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139789_0139960 it is not tackling
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141567_0141760 we have not been dealing with
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141989_0142114 i think it is the new
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0143373_0143511 going to attack
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144422_0144689 what i feel is customers never said anything about the battery and all
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144689_0144939 it is internal nobody looks into the battery
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144939_0145209 but shape and curve
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0145866_0146022 with that special form
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0146133_0146305 dylwn ni weld pa gwahaniaeth maen ei wneud
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0151558_0151753 kind of in a regulation making of course
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157223_0157350 ja wykluczył być
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157501_0157589 it was in
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0158800_0158933 to equivalent that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160150_0160473 i do not know but it said fifty percent is the cost
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160473_0160647 i think the agenda one was
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0161295_0161388 what is a plus
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0162472_0162610 tabii ya anladığınız gibi
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165317_0165375 seems fine
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165580_0165807 take supplies to the mission everything
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0169703_0169821 i think you did with the knife
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171331_0171714 yeah i think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171714_0172027 it is not like people trying to cut each other
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172027_0172218 it is more of a cohesive teamwork
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172218_0172557 we came to a very pretty creative design
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172672_0172761 i do not know
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172892_0172964 yeah i think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172964_0173137 and sir you coordinated the work very well
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0179596_0179920 i think that was the best part of it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185416_0185717 yeah the pudding line moving around the room
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185717_0186263 i think it is good like we spend time individually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0189474_0189743 anyone thought of a remote control with a flip top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191020_0191204 that is mine
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191664_0191739 yes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192004_0192079 the kind of head sh 
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192175_0192251 so good
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0199681_0200613 surprising to me is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every month you see a new launch or something like that yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0200613_0201118 and new television products coming up but nobody giving a much idea to this
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0201118_0201302 i think this has been
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0210559_0210707 maybe if people is could not think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0213665_0213719 it is the active
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0215140_0215234 i love my new coat
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0216751_0216948 celebration you did not talk about that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005586_0005769 i think so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005769_0006085 i think the first thing you do is introduce ourselves
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006200_0006547 and his name and what your function is
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006547_0006729 so maybe stuck it nope
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0008798_0008859 and your name is
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010788_0010851 very good
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010851_0011071 and as you already know i am betsy
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011071_0011307 i am the project manager for today
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011307_0011817 so why do not we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012134_0012611 yes the opening acquaintance tool training world
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012611_0013238 the tools i think we already i guess the tool is really the computer as far as i can see
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013287_0013804 each of us will get instructions and we will take it from there
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013804_0014097 project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014097_0014616 i do not think we have any great discussion at this point
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014944_0015168 here is what this thing should be
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015168_0015754 this thing here the design is a new remote control
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015754_0016232 should be original trendy and of course user friendly
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0016519_0016699 so maybe you will make some notes of that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019638_0019744 all right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019744_0020164 here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0020378_0021157 that is it is going to be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021157_0021820 the same goes for the conceptual design there will be individual work and then discussion afterwards
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021944_0022212 detail design same thing
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0024394_0024545 i can not write this
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025468_0025736 yeah
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025736_0025774 right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026002_0026470 then tool training try out the whiteboard person can draw their favorite animal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026470_0026872 does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026872_0027252 so that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027468_0027612 if you want to go eileen and
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027758_0027986 whether you without hanging yourself
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0028810_0029082 and remember you have to press so it works
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0030752_0031064 that is a fat cat
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032052_0032258 and you are francine right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032258_0032750 would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033022_0033083 i do not know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033083_0033153 no that is okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033357_0033549 i did not get to that late
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0036725_0037272 here is a project finance which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037272_0037593 um selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037725_0038609 the company is profit aim is fifty million euros the market range is unlimited meaning international
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0038740_0039364 and production costs should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0040381_0041267 so these are all things of course to remember with the budget and when you design to materials cost et cetera
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0041916_0042758 now the discussion i guess is does any one of you have experience with remote control
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0042895_0043324 oops we use them right every day
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043324_0043499 and
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043656_0044399 now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did not like with it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0044399_0044923 things you would like to change things you would like to improve with this thing any first ideas
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0045037_0046058 do you like it to be smaller bigger have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons you know things like that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0046515_0046621 small right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0048672_0049526 so it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines basically
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051311_0051812 it should be something new it should do something different than just what we have
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051812_0052107 now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052422_0052829 like trendy you know like earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052829_0053345 maybe in different colors or materials
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0053345_0053873 so yeah shapes right you know like kidney shaped feels better in your hand or something you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055123_0055827 that is true they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or you know whatever
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055827_0056564 and suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the tv off and say where the hell is my remote control
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0056614_0057317 or if it is really in a dark spot that it gives out a sound or a signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057471_0057593 so if you floss like
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057674_0058145 if lost signal throw a signal you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058567_0058790 exactly i mean just that is why i am saying
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058790_0059260 i am just saying throw signal meaning just whether it is a beam or whether it is light
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060567_0060957 okay my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060957_0061646 in other words if it is in a dark spot meaning your newspaper is on top
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0061646_0062032 sweater is on top or it is behind a plant
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062032_0062575 at that moment it is like what do you call it the light sensors you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062575_0063003 in that moment it has a sensor it gets a certain darkness
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063003_0063476 it has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063476_0063721 i mean we can discuss that later you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064129_0064224 that is right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064224_0065078 you know it would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and i think voice or clapping that is not specific enough
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0065078_0065848 i know there are the lamps and stuff you know you can clap on and off but i think they only work to a certain degree
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066408_0066480 what we are
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066770_0067159 oh yeah well but then those could be we can not help everybody
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0067808_0068395 okay we have to move along yeah we have to move along but i think we have some good points to start with here
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068584_0068849 okay the next painting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068849_0069212 i think you will did you get notices on your computer for this
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069212_0069545 okay so you have got the notice
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069545_0070163 the working design i guess that is the function id who is this
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070163_0070398 industrial designer yeah that is you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070746_0071113 so we are looking for a working design when we come back
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0071572_0072011 and then the technical function so you are the working design
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072011_0072439 so you have a working design and then a functional design
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072439_0073430 and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in general
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073430_0073594 that would be your idea
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073594_0073824 and of course price
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073824_0074169 that is it that is it that the price is a good price
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074169_0074465 i mean the price is given but that was
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074633_0074679 that is right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074944_0075008 that is right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075138_0075610 and you will get specific instructions for that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075610_0075784 i think that is the end of the show
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0076472_0077087 so we have well we have time two three minutes
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077087_0077357 any questions at this point
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077357_0077595 or suggestions
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077780_0078716 i think basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions i guess you can
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0079796_0080194 then we see you in about thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0080194_0080361 and see what we can come up with
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009185_0009269 i am jemma b
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009269_0010740 i am my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design

AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0049278_0049524 machines basically
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0051779_0051874 now of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0052783_0053265 maybe different colors or materials

AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0057201_0057472 or a signal yeah
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058148_0058588 yeah maybe it should have a light so that we can just recognize where it is
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058588_0058634 exactly
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058700_0058795 so that is why i am saying
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0059086_0059303 i think a good

AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0070461_0070773 yeah it is functioning yeah okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071171_0071568 working design yeah it is mainly technical functional design
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071725_0071875 technical functions
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079125_0079260 about you people
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079260_0079395 yeah you may have a look
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079652_0079781 all right well let us see
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006739_0006909 my name is franzene
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006909_0007661 and i am a user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0007661_0008083 and my role is to design a television remote control
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032223_0032416 yes i would like to see
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032416_0032508 yeah i am sure
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033158_0033336 no i am challenging
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033747_0033963 too bitch
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0034799_0034978 i am going to go to sleep
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0035586_0035895 okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0045394_0045442 i
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046146_0046571 yes i feel that all the remote should be very compact
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046571_0046979 those which we get here nowadays it is very long
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046979_0047276 and it should have multipurpose
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047276_0047914 like the remote control which we use for tv it should be used for some other purpose also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047914_0048673 like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating system
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0048848_0048946 yeah
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052105_0052326 yeah design should be yeah it should be different
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052326_0052544 almost all the
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052790_0052882 so maybe that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0053067_0053246 material
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057312_0057325 you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057704_0057778 i appreciate it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057858_0058016 signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0063866_0063918 and so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0066540_0066638 bu bir fesülye
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0005725_0005770 i think so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0006154_0006257 yeah that is a good point
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008339_0008533 and i am a marketing person
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008533_0008694 i want to figure out how to sell them
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008882_0008969 my name is eileen
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022046_0022155 same thing
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022276_0022645 different types of design that we are going to be concerned with
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0023611_0023838 садись
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024101_0024250 mmm
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024812_0025104 maybe we should redesign it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0025279_0025469 after we finish the remote control we will get to that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027623_0027852 okay i will see what i can do
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027852_0027889 so we
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0028008_0028551 see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029006_0029219 that is so cool
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029219_0029775 um about um to the evil cat
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0030798_0031573 that is a fact that is a very sad fact
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0031573_0031812 and it like sit like that okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0032877_0033282 am i supposed to wipe off no no no that is okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035732_0035806 ah okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035999_0036482 i hope the kitty cat is hungry because they are not like snakes
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0039523_0039851 okay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0040286_0040648 so these are all things of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0049614_0050276 about twelve euros fifty cents per
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050378_0050675 well who knows if we get a really good sign maybe we can do that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050780_0051357 we certainly can try to i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0051736_0051776 this hat
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0053853_0054232 yeah in friendly shape yeah that would help
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0054232_0055025 i think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0055025_0055113 and they can not find it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0056602_0056712 well or yeah or
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0057264_0057676 yeah so it should either be flossed
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0058039_0058091 oh a signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0059225_0060571 i do think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what should you have to do to make it beep or blink
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0062554_0062623 oh in that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0063909_0064125 so the light sensor would activate the signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0065819_0066177 but it could be someplace really obvious and you still would not be able to find it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066522_0066689 well because you are selling
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066689_0066793 because people are so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066866_0067777 and those can be we can not help everybody well if we are like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0067777_0067999 you have to move along
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0074525_0074986 we have to justify that by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0078758_0079163 i think i have enough to think about to our next meeting
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079163_0079283 about two people
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079650_0079774 all right well i guess
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0080380_0080453 okay very good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0003732_0003865 okay so everybody ready
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0004717_0005869 i take it you all have received instructions as to what we were supposed to do yes and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0006079_0006733 i think the marketing manager probably should come first addressing the needs and desires
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0007843_0007903 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0009559_0009705 and participate
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010096_0010373 okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010629_0010753 oh good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034130_0034686 one other appliance or maybe a lamp can i at this point interject something
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034686_0035355 we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0035355_0036262 the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext because that is sort of outdated okay it is the internet
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0036262_0037062 and according to higher management it should only control the tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0037062_0038107 mostly because they feel that it is too complex a task to include other things and they are concerned with the time to market
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0038285_0039112 and the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039112_0039508 and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039508_0040221 so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040221_0040704 and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040704_0041353 so i just wanted to check this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the things we want to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041353_0041995 these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things so only going to be tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041995_0042510 but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0042638_0042729 okay alright
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056303_0056460 and um
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056599_0057157 who would be next i guess that would be you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0057229_0057449 you want me to get your slideshow yeah yeah sure
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058082_0058319 and you are number three number two
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058319_0058366 namaste
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060454_0060526 yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060798_0060871 mm hmm
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0071692_0072250 that is already been eliminated by management so we are off the hook
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0083585_0084194 it is possible yeah well that is it yeah that is really the so that is it is a question yeah point you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0085700_0085744 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086748 it just built up to be basically you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086928_0087468 it is a budget we are looking at if you build one wall that is going to make a big difference whether it is going to be square or not
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088357_0088405 oh yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088531_0089146 i would help with the marketing we will have to look at the budget on that but i think in principle that would be kind of fun
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089146_0089183 because we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089549_0089661 silly silly
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089733_0089875 like a dog
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096671_0096935 a little elderly a little arthritic you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096935_0097875 and it is a small button and and they do not press it exactly you know something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they are very frustrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0100099_0100191 get to that with you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102284_0102486 because the clock could be really fast
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102808_0103154 you know you see that scene in your career you know why they are here
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0108556_0108634 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0111613_0111738 older
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0115161_0115274 oh you do not have to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0117944_0117979 this one
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0119741_0119918 and then tie
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120040_0120160 you are
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120306_0120341 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0121071_0121245 what can you foot foot foot foot
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0127901_0128111 on the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0128111_0128168 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0130485_0130598 i am trying
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0149375_0149515 timer yeah timer
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0150288_0150602 okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0153384_0154275 on my slideshow basically we have already done the agenda and on the closing basically there will be lunch break and all that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0154275_0155070 however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155070_0155734 and what function working design how does it work
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155734_0156064 so these are the two things we should come up with
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0156064_0156654 so the first thing is maybe a little easier on who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157093_0157263 i guess in many ways everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157448_0157621 everybody who has a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157798_0158314 yeah and i think today there are probably not many people who do not have a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158314_0158496 there are a few but in general no
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158673_0159520 now talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody but i think within the target group we have subgroups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0159520_0160519 we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160519_0160975 so i think that is one group that is certainly important
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160975_0161845 then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0161845_0162455 and i do not know how much we want to cater to children is use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0162455_0163223 i mean that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163447_0163714 so these are just some thoughts i have on it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163714_0165367 and i do not know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are going to design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we are talking about different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0165367_0166225 whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0167876_0168847 a lot of marketing pull that has a lot of appeal but i think i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0168847_0169322 i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0169322_0170178 you know like you make it nice and pink fluorescent banana color or whatever you know you make a banana shaped one yeah for example you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170178_0170467 but the question is really who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170623_0170867 do we look at one target group
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170984_0172090 and with the twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0172297_0172966 sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0173074_0173490 out of the cost we are supposed to respect
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0175538_0175628 with you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0176298_0176399 well that is in the family
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0179785_0180380 the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0180380_0181272 and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know within the target group or subgroups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0181272_0182218 the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182218_0182431 i mean the basic design i understand will be the same
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182431_0183428 but the question is how much will that set us back if let us say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0183533_0184353 so that remains to be seen but the target group as a whole is basically everybody with a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0185553_0185747 yeah well that is the question
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0186847_0187426 well maybe there is an idea you know for example new portable phones
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187426_0187816 they have like removable plastic cases
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187816_0188477 so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0188477_0190040 that in each package you know you have oh there is a real idea yeah you have for example you have let us say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another color or a stripe whatever that already comes in the package
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190040_0190371 and then if people really want more colors they can buy it separately
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190507_0190650 mobile phones
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190927_0190982 that is right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190982_0191694 but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0191694_0192696 and they can go to the store for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it you know for example
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0194549_0196111 well i think the idea here is to design one remote and the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0196111_0197066 having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197287_0197556 five minutes i guess that is the old message
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197828_0197944 finish with that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197944_0198241 um
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0198892_0199452 but i think we do some more research i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0199452_0200023 if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200145_0200247 thank you greece and greece
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200474_0201028 do we agree on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201207_0201447 so now i understand lunch break
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201548_0201631 and um
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201778_0201922 so that is what we are going to do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202220_0202324 so thank you very much
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202439_0202690 and we will see you after lunch
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0011039_0011117 for free
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0026483_0026554 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0037439_0037582 to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057119_0057188 bye
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057335_0057454 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057454_0057498 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0058247_0058379 number two
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059092_0059158 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059376_0059594 can you give me a touch of this pink to smudge
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059841_0060125 no that is your car
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060245_0060521 przypijaję
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060521_0060592 the
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060771_0060994 yeah exactly
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060994_0061373 i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061373_0061644 can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061832_0062592 the method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0062592_0063941 it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can not be an electric supply like you have to like switch connect your remote controller to a power supply from the electricity or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0063941_0066293 it should be a battery because remote control should be like you should take it to wherever you want and then this integrated circuit it takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into infrared bits and it sends it to the device
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066293_0066601 like a tv or air conditioner something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066643_0067027 a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0067027_0068629 if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0068629_0070147 it should recognize the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote controller will send a signal
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070147_0070757 and the tv it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070757_0071600 change the volume control and so i think it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0071851_0071905 management
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0072628_0073653 so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user interface like a switch pad or something like that buttons should be there
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073653_0073867 so you can control whatever you want
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073867_0076040 you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the tv or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and tv can perform the actions
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076111_0076315 so you can go to the next slide
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076382_0077721 i just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller i think these are the very simple features and they do not take much of the investment also
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0077721_0079412 it is like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0079506_0081211 and there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote control and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that this is not a you know action
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081211_0081515 there can be no action taken to that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081515_0081690 and there should be a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081690_0083182 like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can not be like if you have kids and all that they will be playing with remote controllers so you can lock the remote controller
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0083182_0084080 if make it usable for more than one device it is hard but it is possible yeah well that is it so that is a question
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084080_0084245 yeah you would point me out
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084245_0085364 and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and um no that is good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0085488_0085806 yeah yeah yeah colors also different colors
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086009_0086577 no no the shape is you do not think it will be like you can have you know if you want it just build that to be amazing
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086627_0086683 yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086683_0086926 it is just as shapes it does not matter
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088300_0088570 yeah that is also possible
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088713_0088792 yeah i have got a budget on that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089120_0089205 because we had
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089635_0089884 for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089884_0090028 yeah that is the one
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090210_0090371 that is the key
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090440_0091106 and the buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091106_0091392 if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091392_0091748 if you have less features then your remote controller will not be attractive
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091748_0092561 so i think we need to make some buttons which are intended for two or three operations
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0092561_0093299 like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press the other button in another mode it will change the color
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0093299_0093901 so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0094196_0094311 with the user
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0095879_0096045 it is like you and i
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0096256_0096337 time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0097647_0097780 being elves and they are very
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0098176_0098450 you do not feel the mercy
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099002_0099208 yeah shapes also different
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099208_0099290 a triangle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100079_0100646 but we will get to that with you and also text should be very clear so that there will not be any ambiguities that is right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100706_0100788 that is a good part yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100893_0102201 and display clock if you want more features then we can display a clock it i do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit yeah that is that is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102313_0102440 because the clock could be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102753_0103119 you know you see when you could be a you know what
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0103811_0104056 can you do the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104056_0104880 uh components are the main components we need for uh it had like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104880_0105030 and bulbs
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105030_0105851 like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the tv is on suppose
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105851_0106265 then the remote controller should automatically have a light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106384_0106796 then it will be like if you switch on your tv through another source
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106796_0107456 not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107456_0107578 maybe we can hash that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107578_0107880 whenever the tv is on remote controller will have a light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108020_0108277 and then infrared bulbs
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108277_0108576 this is like when it is dark
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108668_0109143 and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109143_0109521 chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109521_0110074 and wires connecting all chips switches lights everything so there should be wires
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110167_0110652 and of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110652_0111183 you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0111509_0111579 hold up
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112017_0112192 i am gonna need these
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112286_0112464 next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112611_0113850 i have referred the site the homepage of our website from where i got a few points
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0114021_0114147 that is it that is it for me now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115275_0115370 it is not like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115370_0116172 i have referred the page to get new ideas of like what can be the working design to how it works
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116450_0116514 if you want
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116568_0116646 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0117636_0117926 it is actually there on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137491_0137642 ему то что
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137642_0137890 if there is a club then there can be a lot of snacks
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0149124_0149678 later and use it okay it is like a timer timer yeah timer yeah and then you can use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0157482_0157685 who has a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0158170_0158348 do not have a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0175767_0176417 we can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0176666_0176809 and a middle east budget
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177578_0177728 yeah of course that we can do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177728_0179020 but specifically if like elderly people want big buttons then you can not really make a big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a remote controller for elderly and for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179020_0179123 what about the electronics
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179295_0179446 it does not cost that much
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179728_0179872 the question is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186614_0186661 you are set
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186661_0186947 industrial person i do not think no well maybe there is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186947_0187015 there is an idea
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0190462_0191133 yeah like mobile phones we have different covers
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0194588_0194668 i think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198668_0198931 yeah maybe
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198931_0199144 i think we need to do some more research
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200029_0200753 do we agree on that in principle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200825_0200991 we will be able to do that on
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0202280_0202326 bucky
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0026925_0026998 somebody take
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0027570_0027685 still sizzle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0071586_0071643 not purple
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0085727_0085777 je suis
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0086714_0086806 no just us
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0089813_0089969 shit
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0097699_0097754 and their
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0102334_0102375 because
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111068_0111184 ie i gyd remot
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111410_0111519 at this holder
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111519_0111649 erholt remotor
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0119903_0119972 to spend due time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0120208_0120273 no no i am three
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121036_0121146 what do you forget
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121146_0121371 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121442_0122422 as a user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122422_0122697 can you please go on to the next slide
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122697_0123822 so i found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0123988_0124081 now for that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0124081_0125332 a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the tv and it can control the functionalities different functionalities of the tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0125332_0126793 there should be a signal something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0126978_0127965 now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user choice
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128388_0128951 so if you want to view a particular program let us say nine oclock he can set the time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128951_0129389 and the tv will automatically switch on at that particular time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0129389_0130658 so he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0130658_0131316 then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0131316_0132153 and one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0132383_0133347 the remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0133347_0134209 and this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t an alphabet for more compactability
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134353_0134816 and there is one more point which i noted it down
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134816_0135989 like the material which is used for remote should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some allergy to either children or to an adult person
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0135989_0137124 and it should have an alarm clock a person if somebody wants to get up at around eight pm and you can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137124_0137523 and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137830_0138232 yes and as john we said the buttons can be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0138232_0139184 we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139184_0139773 so even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139914_0140886 and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0140886_0141138 he should not be harmed in any way
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0141528_0142412 and findings i found out on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0142412_0143443 there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0143608_0144513 so you have different types of remotes with different light source which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of the television
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145325_0145407 bis zum nächsten mal
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145632_0146151 and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for multipurpose use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0146201_0147193 it can be used as a tv control plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing and it should have a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147193_0147988 and then to save electricity there should not be much more lots of circuits and all that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147988_0148961 and if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten oclock then it should be switched off at ten oclock automatically
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0148961_0149228 so that nobody else comes later and use it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0149547_0149771 yeah and then you can use a timer as well
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0150148_0150198 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0157657_0157792 tv television news
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0169295_0169374 you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0173696_0175737 generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from ten to forty right and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people with who have nervous problems
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0176300_0177029 in a family there will be an aged person children and a middle aged person but they cannot buy three different remotes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0177029_0177625 they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used by all the three
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0179221_0179323 much is it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0192775_0194536 but yeah i have a doubt like will it be cost twice effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0195575_0195659 oh okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0199939_0200079 within that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0003972_0004279 i will just put on my microphone here and i will play right with you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007539_0007703 okay who am i to start right now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007998_0008644 well could you put my slides up because i think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009682_0009830 i have never felt this way before
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009830_0009886 yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010847_0010963 and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010963_0011958 okay well i think we have introduced ourselves so the functional requirements is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012069_0012334 because that is where my discussion starts
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012334_0013030 all right well since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013030_0013619 i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013619_0014672 and the reason i just put that there like that is that in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0014672_0015069 you know you could say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0015069_0016531 it should heat up your motor it should turn on your cd or whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0016562_0017633 so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is going to be to add a feature or how expensive it is going to be or if your time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0017633_0018011 it takes five years to develop this it is just something we can not do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018011_0018921 so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can not be done for one reason or another
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018921_0019778 and then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer we will try to then prioritize those
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0019778_0020047 so that was what i meant there
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020047_0020887 and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really going to be as important as money
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020887_0021322 because if we are going to sell this thing i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021364_0021801 twenty five euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021801_0022222 we want somebody to see it and think it is i just gotta have that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022222_0022406 and take out their wallet and buy it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022406_0022828 so it is got to be really attractive but it is got to go to market by september
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022828_0023485 because anything that you do not have already out there in september showing it around is not going to sell for christmas
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0023485_0026102 and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026131_0026563 so we are coming to you for how much is it gonna cost and how long is it gonna take you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026563_0027101 and i will be coming to you to tell me what is gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027101_0027851 what is gonna really be what they call the sizzle because we have got to sell the sizzle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027851_0029054 a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just going to take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029054_0029206 okay can we go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029486_0030625 i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the whole house idea really is not going to be possible
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0030625_0031175 so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying you could suggest anything
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031175_0031708 i would like the suggestions to be really specific so that we will have a list of things we can cross off
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031708_0032924 not something like whole house control and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0032924_0033501 at the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at we should be able to make it work the tv the vcr
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0033501_0034381 the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034381_0034459 i think we are going to win
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034568_0034638 so
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038132_0038212 of course
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038308_0038440 bye
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0041820_0041895 oh and he is got a new
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042700_0042838 all right thanks for that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042838_0043738 all right now other things that i found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0043738_0044093 a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044093_0044900 and that was thirty four percent and even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost some land of room
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044900_0045388 so those are two things that we definitely do want to address
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0045388_0046099 we want to make it as simple as possible we want to make it obvious and intuitive to use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0046099_0047160 and then the things about finding it we talked about the light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047160_0047734 and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047734_0047873 okay can we go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047965_0048737 okay so my personal preferences in this project are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0048737_0049169 that is the selling point the thing that is going to make it an impulse purchase
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049169_0049802 because once there is no be back in sales they always say you know be backs do not come back
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049802_0050107 if somebody says oh i will come back and get it next week you are dead
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050107_0050250 they are never going to come back and buy it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050250_0050983 you have got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now now is a big word in my book for selling this thing
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051054_0051832 and in order to make it really saleable we have got to shorten the learning curve make sure it is really intuitive and easy to use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051832_0052603 we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that is why i am saying simplicity is good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052603_0052895 finding it is important obviously you can not use it if you can not find it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052895_0053566 so you have got to concentrate on the features that help you find it and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053566_0053911 there should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053911_0054476 so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say ah twenty five euros i am not going to take that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054476_0054921 has to be so great that they are going to say oh twenty five euros is not much
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054921_0055696 and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0055696_0055895 okay that is a bad age for me right now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0071650_0072292 yeah that is already been eliminated by management so we are off the hook
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0075399_0075459 integrate
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0083710_0083926 yeah well that is been it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085300_0085700 that is good from a marketing point of view the fun shape
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085700_0085982 you say that will not add too much to the budget
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085982_0086172 to the shapers
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0087557_0088267 do you think there is any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088416_0088504 i have had good enough
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088504_0088682 i help with the marketing
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0089144_0090328 because we had something sort of sexy for adults we could have something sort of silly for children like a dino or a little elephant so they can remember where it is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0093904_0094930 i think that that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person because i think there is a lot of arguments to be made for one button for one feature
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0094930_0095705 so i think one of the things people were complaining about when i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0095705_0096316 the changing modes was something i mean you and i all four of us we work with computers all the time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096316_0096672 changing modes is nothing for us but people who
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096845_0096954 you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0097752_0098520 it is the kind of thing people learn by feel you do not feel the mode change
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0098520_0099118 so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be helpful yeah shapes also definitely
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0099118_0100076 you know like a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100076_0100251 but we will get to that with you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100587_0100676 that is right yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100676_0100766 no that is a good point
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0102143_0102905 yeah that is a good one because the clock could be really friendly when is your favorite show coming on
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103084_0103293 yeah and a lot of times there is not a clock on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103293_0103559 and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103559_0103774 you know that is good the cock is good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0114715_0115075 so we should visit the site and have a look at what is up there
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116205_0116375 so it might be helpful if we had a look at that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116540_0116634 okay thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0117284_0117607 did you go back to that slide where she had that side up
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0118011_0118110 yeah okay thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0135833_0135885 i did
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0137802_0138030 and as john rhys
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166276_0166737 well you know there is the old motto children under six never shop alone
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166737_0168094 so if you design something that is very attractive to children the mommy please mommy please we want it now we want to go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169274_0169314 that is right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169762_0169980 you can make a banana shaped one yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179007_0179132 what about the electronics
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179132_0179323 that is not really going to change much is it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179406_0179688 that will not change much will it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179808_0179911 the question
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0184362_0185216 that is right and can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185216_0185658 or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185658_0186120 the questions and basically all that is going to be different is the plastic case
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186120_0186575 and in that case we could probably molded plastic is not all that expensive is it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186575_0186754 here is an industrial person
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0188725_0188880 there is a real idea yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0191056_0191112 if they are never
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0192228_0192322 an alternate package
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0194615_0194841 i think the idea here is to do this
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0197756_0197905 viel spaß
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0198506_0198918 well we may have to come back to our next meeting
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0200114_0200201 okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0201029_0201159 okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004216_0004299 hello everyone
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004479_0004718 how are we doing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004927_0005625 first we are going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0005625_0006870 in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working meaning gathering suggestions
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0006997_0007904 from everyone to see how she best could market this product within the budget that was given
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008138_0008820 in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008975_0009457 it is also an item that people lose a lot
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009457_0009814 so we should address that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009814_0010097 and of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010196_0010416 that is very simple to use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010556_0011343 in addition to that to make it sell of course the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011343_0011676 or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011777_0012321 so that people are buying it now because in particular with smaller items
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0012321_0013004 that is a very important fact because if they say well i go home and think about it that will not work
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013079_0013750 also mentioned was it should have a very short learning curve
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013868_0014315 and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0014486_0015156 our technical manager has then said that he feels it should have a chip
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0015303_0016034 that has infrared bits and it has an interface that controls the chips
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016141_0016636 therefore messages will be controlled in the same manner
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016636_0017055 there should be extra features like lit buttons maybe a beep
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017055_0017265 if too many buttons are pressed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017385_0018387 child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018493_0018818 you could see the time you know what show they want to watch
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018818_0019144 also mentioned was maybe different shapes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0019338_0020355 so the components of the thing should be button bulbs infrared bulbs battery chips wires and maybe some kind of a holder
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0020468_0020854 for the item
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0021026_0022213 francina who is our interface designer has mentioned that the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0022213_0022856 of course should have an on off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023009_0023561 particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023561_0023683 it should be compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023683_0024093 her personal favorite was it should be t shaped
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024093_0024326 and maybe having an alarm clock
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024326_0024794 and material should possibly be of non allergic nature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025022_0025699 the different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025804_0026480 maybe it should have electricity saving feature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0026583_0027722 and even possibly a timer so that people can program their favorite program right from the remote
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0027908_0028452 uh are we all in agreement that that is about what we discussed last time yes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0028659_0029094 then i am looking for three presentations
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0029094_0029975 and i do not know whether the order matters much i do not think so so whoever wants to start first yeah okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0030610_0030733 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0031419_0031552 oh who is that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0032145_0032361 and that is number two right
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037338_0037392 nein
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037392_0037633 nine channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037796_0037911 nine channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037911_0037995 ещё
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071148_0071367 okay thank you very much
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071367_0071681 any comments on her presentation
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074229_0074411 yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074936_0075179 no i think these are her presentations
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0075179_0076320 but as far as the decision making we have to come back to that okay but if i just wanted to know whether anybody had any anything to add to her no i think her personal
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076418_0076442 right
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076735_0076947 who wants to go next
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077090_0077226 okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077711_0077778 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0078760_0078872 or compounds the same
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0098452_0098489 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130408_0130522 and you have more pictures
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130522_0130739 we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134033_0134113 okay well thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134248_0134577 any particular comments by anybody
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0137498_0138269 we do not have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0138383_0138486 okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0151820_0152029 uh that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152200_0152485 concludes the presentation of everyone
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152485_0153203 and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0153362_0154015 and so what do we think on the concept
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0154112_0154194 of the remote
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0156370_0156455 that could be our
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0158654_0158929 well you teach you have to teach
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0161998_0162607 before we get too far off here the components of the concept is the energy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0162607_0162897 what kind of energy do we foresee
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0163699_0163926 okay then chip on print
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164176_0164267 and the case
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164267_0164756 and i think we all agree on the case we want to have something maybe bright colorful
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0165479_0165739 danny design compact and strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166028_0166645 user interface concept interface type supplements
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166960_0167250 i will pee your area
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0167951_0168227 i guess for yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0168722_0168921 i am not sure what they mean by supplements
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169317_0169382 mute
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169701_0169802 i like that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169802_0169923 right right right
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171259_0171654 our next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171654_0172685 and the idea is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then to have to look and feel design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0172871_0173724 and the uid is supposed to come up with the user interface design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0173847_0174301 and the marketing expert with the product evaluation
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0174301_0175288 in this phase the two of you jana and francine have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay it says here
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175288_0175809 you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175954_0177111 if you have any questions you can always contact me or your coach i suppose
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0177327_0178398 so i think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes according to our timetable
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0178752_0178832 thank you very much
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0004829_0004877 ghost
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0040287_0040407 tamam
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077014_0077070 mm hmm
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077209_0077282 dissipate
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077830_0078010 the next one swoops
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0078010_0078122 at the store
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0079698_0080715 this time i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0080715_0080945 can you go on to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081013_0081722 i have just briefed down a few components which we require for the remote control construction
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081722_0082429 the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery etcetera
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082452_0082974 it can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082974_0083549 even if you just you know if it falls down then it does not break
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083549_0083753 so it should be strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083753_0084199 and there are no harmful materials used in that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084199_0084349 and it should be recyclable
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084523_0085230 and yeah and also using of coloring compound compounds like if we want to have different colors
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085230_0085823 blue red green so we have to use some coloring components compounds
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085884_0086444 and the second important thing is integrated circuit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0086444_0087057 we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the heart of the remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087057_0087957 if it is not efficient then everything is going to be less efficient so we should have a highly sophisticated one
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087957_0088348 and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088348_0088688 suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088688_0089579 it should be able to resist the temperature high temperature and low temperatures
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0089579_0090048 and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0090140_0092106 and the other component we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is very very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is i think it is like a battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092199_0092360 can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092605_0093019 a diode a transistor a resonator
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093019_0093692 these are all the technical electronic components which we have to use in a remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093692_0094109 a battery i would like to suggest one thing if we
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0094162_0095016 if we will be able to make a rechargeable battery then we need not go for a high performance battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095016_0095434 even if it is a low performance battery it can not charge much
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095434_0095628 it is not a high voltage battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095628_0096094 then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096094_0096748 so in that way we can cut the cost but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096832_0097215 and we have a circuit board in a remote control build
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097215_0097446 can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097446_0097754 and how it works how the remote controller works
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097754_0097852 when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098639_0098714 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098714_0098982 when you press a button when you do that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098982_0099792 you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a small circuit underneath the button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0099792_0100604 and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0100604_0101397 suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have pressed then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101397_0101770 it produces a more scored line signal specific to that button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101828_0102181 every button every individual button has its own morse code
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0102181_0103151 suppose the user has pressed button one then the circuit will generate a specific morse code to that button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103151_0103896 and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the led which translates the signal into infrared light
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103896_0104247 like you have got a signal by pressing a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104247_0104633 that morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104690_0105088 now that signal that mos code has to be amplified by the transistor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105088_0105449 that is the use of transistor v which we use in the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105449_0106205 it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the led and which translates the signal into an infrared base
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106205_0106914 the sensor in the tv can see the infrared light and seeing the signal it reacts appropriately
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106914_0107871 that when it sees the amplified morse code signal then it will know what action it has to do
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0107871_0108100 then it will do the appropriate action
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108100_0108406 so this is how the remote controller works
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108608_0108739 can go to the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108818_0108950 yeah i have few pictures
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108950_0109602 when you look at the remote controller this is a normal remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109602_0109775 and get an extended piece
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109916_0110176 and we had a few buttons and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110176_0110781 and if you open the remote controller you have this circuit board and few electronic components
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110781_0111206 like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0111206_0112252 and also a capacitor three resistors and also resonator and the diode transistor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0112409_0113165 the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and diode transistors and
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0113411_0114156 yeah you can see the ta one one eight three five labeled chip
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114274_0114940 you can also see the green two green things are they are resistors
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114940_0115695 and just beside that you can see a transistor and a cylinder shape that one is a capacitor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0115695_0116236 and also there are resistors sorry there is a diode
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116236_0116386 can you go on to the next
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116498_0116663 so this is the circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116663_0116861 the green one is a circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116861_0117506 actually building a circuit board is pretty easy and also it is inexpensive
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117506_0117850 it costs less than what you print on a paper
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117850_0118489 because when you are building some circuits and also wires
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0118489_0119311 it is better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119311_0119607 nothing like you know you do not need to use wires and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119607_0119842 it is not exactly wires we are using
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119842_0120132 it is just printing something on a board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120132_0120531 those prints will act as wires and circuits
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120671_0120979 so that green thing is a circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120979_0121709 and also you can see there are access for buttons like when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0121709_0122749 the circuit under the button will be activated it will get some signals from it and it will send the signals to the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122749_0122929 integrated circuit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122929_0123067 in your good books
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123124_0123528 so these are the circuits underneath the buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123528_0123781 can you see the black round mark
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123781_0123904 they are the sydcubes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123998_0124113 exposed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0124113_0125076 and we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0125076_0126004 but a push button requires a simple chip underneath it but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126004_0126666 like for schools we have to go for a sophisticated and full complete shape
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126666_0127306 and as an energy source we offer a basic battery more engineers a hard dynamo
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127306_0127968 a kinetic provision of energy modern watches that you shake casually to provide energy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127968_0128534 so that also we can have in a battery or we can use solar cells
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0128993_0129358 the product can be delivered into different cases
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0129358_0130124 usually the case is uncarved flat that we see usually a normal remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0130672_0131029 yeah maybe i have just one more slide i think
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131214_0131805 like we can have materials such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium we can not use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131805_0132583 and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the print
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132583_0132975 also it includes the infrared sender
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132975_0133592 yet and for the movie just to develop a sample sensor sample speaker
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133716_0133830 yeah that is it
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133922_0134042 to a full no
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135352_0135967 no no no the scrolling was different like you can go for switches like buttons or scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135967_0136326 which we used to do ten years before i think
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136326_0136783 now nobody uses it because you need a sophisticated chitin doll
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136783_0137172 so i think it is better we go for ordinary button we will just go for button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0137172_0137325 yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0155951_0155980 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0156682_0157287 yeah i agree with that but i am very much doubtful how far it will work
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157287_0157809 because speech recognizer like it has its own distance problem
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157856_0158196 yeah it is not distance problem it is recognizing a person is voice
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158196_0158744 like maybe different people will be having different voices so like everything
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158875_0159324 so to get a good recognizing system it is a tricky thing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0160727_0160814 yeah but i have yet to see it
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0164914_0165021 trendy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0165087_0165205 friendly just
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167428_0167885 like the switches like we use buttons for user interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167992_0168050 push buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0169896_0169937 hello
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0178831_0178919 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0021374_0021488 interfaced
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0029733_0029926 whoever wants to
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0030545_0030674 my stomach
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0032580_0032667 that string through
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0033756_0034196 as an interface designer i would give more emphasis on the interface design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034196_0034711 how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034904_0035003 next please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035170_0035689 now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035689_0036777 these messages could be a switch on off message a switch to next channel message a swapping the channels a switching on to a particular channel
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0036777_0037125 like you can have the numbers one two three four up to nine
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037733_0037769 but me
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037914_0038091 yes nine numbers
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0038297_0039313 and then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0039580_0040685 then you should have a next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0040685_0040793 next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041040_0041593 then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041810_0042459 then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0042459_0043076 for example if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0043076_0043969 then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044193_0044767 then there should be some buttons which can control features like the color
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044767_0045303 color of the picture the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0045677_0045873 now there should be a memory switch
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046272_0046472 there should be a mute button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046472_0047301 suddenly if a viewer gets a telephone call and he does not want to switch off the tv
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0047301_0048236 but he can reduce the sound he can bring the volume down and he can watch while talking he can watch the tv
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0048236_0048884 now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049045_0049572 it is an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049852_0050709 so remote can be designed which can have the voice recognizers you can record your own voice
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051039_0051517 which can be recognised by a voice recogniser in the television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051517_0052189 for example if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052189_0052811 the remote will automatically switch to the ninth channel
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052811_0053586 so the tv will have some recognizer which will recognize the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0053586_0053930 so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054117_0054527 so this is one of the interface which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054720_0055229 a very simple interface which has all the important features
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055337_0055442 please next slide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055573_0056263 these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056263_0056861 so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056861_0057360 so you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057360_0057596 even a kid can use that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057596_0057810 so can you go on to the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057900_0058505 yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0058505_0059282 and this has multi purpose use it can be used for tv it can be used for cable satellites it can be used for vcr dvd is and audio
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0059519_0059766 and this has inbuilt voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060165_0060335 and you will not do the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060335_0061014 yeah now this is an interface for a child for a remote which a child can use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061014_0061664 this is user friendly it is very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061664_0062022 and this comes with different colors different shapes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0062692_0063723 and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0063815_0064076 attractive child interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064655_0064779 bir sonraki tarifte görüşürüz
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064779_0065694 now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066114_0066729 i could lose that in a minute this is very big you cannot misplace it anywhere
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066729_0067250 so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to misplace or lose
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067389_0067648 this is one such interface which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067837_0068986 and the personal preference would be to incorporate speech recognizers which will respond to users voice for a particular function
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0069197_0069294 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0072873_0072896 ps
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0075564_0075593 be careful
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0108382_0108416 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0113958_0114005 mbc 뉴스 김수진입니다
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0137241_0137310 are in
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0154766_0155184 yes i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0155994_0156254 this could be a one feature which could be sellable
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159121_0159844 it is like you are recording a question already
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159844_0160229 and then you are expecting an answer from for example you have a tv system
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160229_0160992 i am the user and my family members are the user i will already record a question like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160992_0161438 good morning like around eight oclock i want to see the news in the television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161438_0161756 so i will say just good morning and the tv will switch on
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161756_0162029 it will recognize my voice and it will switch on
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0164881_0164970 god that hurts
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0165119_0165290 friendly decent compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0167885_0167954 push buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0168978_0169657 some different types of features buttons yeah like mute button like krispy kreme
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0178837_0178885 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0028468_0028599 yeah i got pretty much the same
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065632_0065748 you do not know me
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065748_0066286 i could lose that in a minute
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072037_0072494 well looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072494_0072892 um what no suggestion is bad
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072892_0073178 but we are gonna have to narrow it down a little more
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0073178_0074006 i do not think that we can get the t shape is good the child one is good it is a too victimist place i think it is just funny
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074006_0074814 i do not think that is going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074814_0075047 it is going to be a little bit no i think she will be
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075159_0075207 yeah but
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075476_0075617 have to come back to them
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0076254_0076643 no i think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0084611_0084654 good point
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0128530_0128654 oh that is interesting
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0134648_0135275 on the scroll and the push button you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0137109_0137442 we will just go for push buttons for interest of cost
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138188_0138348 can we write my first and my next slide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138641_0139591 all right my method is i am interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0139591_0140222 so i have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140222_0140793 i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140793_0141346 and then when i am out in people is houses or meetings or anything like that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141346_0141886 i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it is convenient in the conversation i ask about it
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141886_0142148 and i would encourage you all to do the same
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142148_0142685 and my findings from this is that you know small is beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142685_0143016 people like something that really fits in their hand
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143016_0143144 simple is beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143144_0143839 they do not want to have to squint at small print they want buttons whose functions are obvious
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143839_0144355 and they want as few buttons as possible and they do not care for the mode thing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144355_0144558 they want each button to do something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144558_0144676 and eye catching is important
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144676_0144923 it is got to look cute it is got to look appealing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144923_0145145 go ahead i am trying to finish fast for you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145145_0145782 and our preference is as far as i am concerned we have got to get to the market before the competition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145782_0146250 ours has to look really great and it has to come out before the others
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146250_0146840 so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146840_0147354 and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0147354_0148032 if we try to sell people it has too many great features the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148032_0148872 so we have got to narrow our selection down to two things i think that we are going to say are really great about our new product
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148872_0149481 and i have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149481_0149939 and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149939_0150324 and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150324_0150982 they are more back into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on them
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150982_0151470 so those are things maybe we want to look at as far as saleability of the item
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0154519_0154897 you want to try to come back to yours yes i would like to
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0155631_0155945 so speech recognition is most important as far as you are concerned
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156276_0156529 yeah that could be our star feature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156529_0156793 that might be really good yeah i agree with that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0157714_0157817 distance problem
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163036_0163363 battery i think battery battery i think we all agreed on that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163363_0163659 that is going to be most cost effective and the best thing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0164816_0165230 bright colorful compact trendy trendy trendy and strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0168945_0169070 so we will always be good
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169264_0169694 yeah or like crispy shrimp it could also be a supplement
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169694_0169928 i was speech recognition specialist
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0170012_0170726 okay so why do not we put down speed tracked ignition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0176912_0177406 where were they hiding
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0003938_0004133 well hi everyone again
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0004324_0005440 i have to read you the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0005591_0006464 it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0006567_0007903 designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the tv
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0007903_0008979 it should have nine channel buttons an x button volume buttons subtitle buttons switch to control features color contrast sharpness etcetera
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009020_0009435 for different memory switch a mute button in case the telephone rings or something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009435_0010653 speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to be integrated in this new remote
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0011091_0012013 it should be child friendly design with few buttons colorful maybe with star shaped or other shaped buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0012013_0012926 she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013217_0013332 that is right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013485_0014410 but her very personal favorite really she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0014410_0015315 the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0015315_0016438 she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong not using any harmful materials should be recyclable and should be colorful
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0016564_0017116 should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0017284_0018010 she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated in
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0018010_0019144 technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor diode transistor resonator and if possibly rechargeable battery
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019263_0019471 and of course the circuit board
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019599_0019852 and how it would work so you press the button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019852_0022001 the chip is morse code related relays to the generator amplification the circuit board is very inexpensive to build she thinks this is a great feature to consider
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022216_0022696 she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022804_0023264 the scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0023384_0023891 should be battery operated and of course should have the special cases
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0024040_0025146 the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0025146_0026273 done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0026431_0026654 easy to use and it should be eye catching
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0027036_0027745 from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0028058_0029057 to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029213_0029697 too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029697_0030149 so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030288_0030916 it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030916_0031126 she feels that is really what people want today
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0031293_0032097 and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0032218_0033189 the energy should be battery should be on a chip should be trendy design compact and strong and should have buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0033325_0033798 and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes of the last meeting
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0034072_0034535 now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0042922_0043023 mm hmm
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0046331_0046436 n e d
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052178_0052253 what kind of button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052399_0052600 a menu a one one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064279_0064480 yes the buttons are all raised right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064566_0064651 race and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0065317_0065522 we will have two hands to open it up
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0067081_0067808 yes and it sort of sticks up so that you really you do not have to first go like oh yeah here it is all in yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0069570_0069806 so if you are left handed or right handed
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072255_0072883 i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072883_0073380 like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0073933_0074457 will have symbols so that the user really knows you know it does not have to be good
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0074976_0075613 but anyway it has to have some kind of symbols text or something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075772_0075805 that is right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075924_0076155 okay i just want to make sure of that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0076927_0077000 right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079005_0079329 that was one of our special features for the marketing
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079329_0079718 that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0080276_0080937 and then the other thing would basically be shape or practicality of use
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0081109_0081159 i will
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084293_0084575 okay now having said that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084864_0085297 no this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0085297_0085576 now we are going to talk about financing
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086184_0086437 well there is a production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086485 that you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086604_0086809 but that is after it is financing oh okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086872_0086929 把银杏
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087539_0087996 okay we had looks and voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087996_0088686 okay now under financing we bring up the there it is
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0088686_0089440 okay uh energy source we say that is battery right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0089637_0089762 okay down
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090085_0090281 so we i guess we use one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090983_0091358 cellar charge you are trying to change the protective
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091358_0091446 oh that is nice
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091530_0091813 he told me i could just change it here and there
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091913_0091984 does not work
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092731_0092979 oh okay yeah okay let us see
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092979_0093328 okay one okay

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093443_0093918 kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093918_0094226 electronic simple chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094226_0094356 is that what we are using
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094356_0094432 one of those
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094559_0094685 come on
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094685_0094872 okay one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094872_0095121 uh regular chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0095286_0095859 that is all we need the one case uncurved flat single curved double curved
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096704_0096864 double curved
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096864_0096935 one of those
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097223_0097444 case materials supplements
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097444_0097645 plastic we sent right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097826_0097962 uh wood rubber
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098268_0098462 but yes but
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098722_0099264 that is just for the case material oh oklahoma special color so we are having that right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0099509_0099901 and then we have the interface push buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100368_0100500 scroll wheel no
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100500_0100770 integrated score with lc display
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101319_0101533 button supplements special color
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101770_0101856 special form
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0102276_0102552 and special material rubber wood yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103051_0103417 total seven point six whatever that means
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103665_0103782 that is the price
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104079_0104235 eight point two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104683_0104824 that points
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104967_0105054 eight point two right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105236_0105427 so we looks like we are
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105564_0105656 well within budget
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0106093_0106272 i guess i should say this i suppose
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0107999_0108108 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108661_0108807 heddiw straight on
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108807_0108969 my documents computer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108969_0109144 i miss you i hear this yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0109683_0109836 okay fine
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110140_0110431 okay good so that is the good news
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110431_0110834 you gotta be popular
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111164_0111424 so that i think financing was pretty simple
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111535_0112165 now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0114600_0114759 you want to go to the next slide yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131419_0131783 i just realized one thing yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131783_0132180 in the financing there was no room for our voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0132429_0133181 and i do not know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0133554_0133711 eight hundred and twenty yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134116_0134616 i mean maximum we have another four point three girls i mean four hundred and thirty
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134767_0135522 but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a finished
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0135522_0136083 as a finished product and saying okay this is a waste recognizer that costs so much
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136202_0136654 so we just have to be aware of that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136654_0137085 i mean and know whether the four hundred and thirty will really cover that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0139488_0140779 i am sorry to interrupt that but i just remembered that that was not included that there was no room for any special features
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0140907_0141086 so be aware of that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141086_0141328 you want to go to the next slide
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141540_0141654 i do not know
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141654_0141780 yeah i think that was my last thought
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0144286_0144428 bye indiana
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0145622_0145736 i think you can make it there
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0148505_0148664 yes i think shape is one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0149756_0149886 you gave me the full
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150247_0150389 um i do not know
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150516_0150699 i think i would give it at least a two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152596_0152725 probably
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152988_0153157 i like the colors
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0154776_0154971 i think i will give it a two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0156922_0157788 well it is also you can not really try it out the other things you have more it is a lot more tangible so from that point of view but um
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0158088_0158204 i will give it a three
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0163765_0164417 here is what we are looking at satisfaction on for example room for creativity
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0164981_0165391 is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0171858_0172740 yeah always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can not
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0172740_0173341 with this particular item we probably can not just add a whole lot of more things
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0173341_0174395 we need to leave space money wise for the voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0174986_0175438 so the question really is how do we feel with the project process
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0175438_0176658 are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0176806_0177143 i think personally i am pretty happy
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177258_0177401 uh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177613_0178216 and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0178586_0179168 i think teamwork was very very good
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179398_0179899 and i think we are really happy with the means we used
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179899_0180315 we used whiteboard we did not use digital pens against all these things
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180745_0180864 yes we could
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180927_0182201 it is maybe not in the best position in the room sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and i think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0182303_0183135 because it was better positioned yes i think so i think absolutely and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183135_0183441 did we find new ideas
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183441_0183527 i think we did
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183727_0184471 i think we did in more than one respect and so i think we did very well here
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184719_0184848 are the costs within budget
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184848_0184947 yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184947_0185232 je projekt evaluirano
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0185367_0185861 then celebration
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186464_0186776 so i thank you all very much
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186776_0187153 i think this was very good and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187272_0187669 i think we did come up with a new product that is feasible
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187669_0188086 feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0188280_0188412 so thank you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0189421_0189660 i always get it on when i am updating it off
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0190479_0190598 oh yeah we have time
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035625_0035939 so this is what we have made
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035939_0036376 this is a model of the remote controller which we are going to build
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0036376_0038147 this is in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is blue in color bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons so it is look wise it is beautiful
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038147_0038429 and also compact in shape
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038429_0039128 and also it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039300_0039665 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039828_0041301 and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic which is strong and also for the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0041445_0042426 the material is plastic and for the buttons it is a soft rubber oh that is good yeah that is nice and fresh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0042426_0042999 yeah because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043039_0043332 and then for the lead
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043332_0044239 for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0044413_0044878 and the buttons part will be explained by fafzana
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0062030_0062128 to make
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0073522_0073605 these buttons were
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0074614_0074775 going into an international market
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075161_0075253 it has to have some
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075541_0076079 we can have on the case itself we can be printed on the case okay yeah just want to make sure
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0077042_0077318 on the snail is shell he goes right back into his shell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0078699_0078921 or something like that you know
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0094238_0094352 is that what we are using
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0096277_0096347 this is a
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0098501_0098936 i think that is for the that is just for the case material
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103508_0103763 i think that is the price
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103915_0104042 hmm
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0108986_0109101 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133675_0133765 i am guessing
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133822_0134090 we have still got four years to go to spend
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138186_0138315 that will buy us
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138953_0139031 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0140240_0140346 included
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0148666_0148936 okay good
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151175_0151364 even i think it is fun
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151364_0151441 explain to me
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0153266_0153342 here once
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0155570_0155756 maybe two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0158869_0159019 treat
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165533_0165606 nu blir jag nervös
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165682_0166106 yeah include some more buttons and features
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166106_0166342 we can make the buttons few buttons smaller
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166342_0167206 i think they are quite big so i think i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0167206_0167460 if we want to have more features in that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0168404_0168517 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0169338_0169663 instead of having two mute buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0177249_0177331 uh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0178437_0178646 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0180636_0180757 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0183540_0183677 yeah rainy
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0188433_0188521 thank you very much
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0189656_0189882 i think we still have some time with you

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0044970_0045542 now we decided upon including certain features in our remote
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0045542_0046564 now these features includes the signal emitting signal it is the led or led the infrared
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0046564_0046958 now we have included the switch on and off button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0047312_0047703 now we have included another feature that is the mute button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048112_0048363 on the side of the model
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048363_0048767 then we have included one to nine buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048890_0049190 for controlling the programs the different channels
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0049751_0050264 we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0050738_0051294 and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0051690_0052136 now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052259_0052337 मेनु बेट
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052416_0052502 amen
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052613_0052695 at the center
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052836_0053649 we have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color sharpness brightness
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0053896_0054005 oh this is a picture
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054300_0054709 we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054854_0055307 now this is a special feature which we have included
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055307_0055379 now this button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055525_0056591 is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0056591_0056916 if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057045_0057353 it will take the user to the previous and the next channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057662_0057755 swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0058428_0059316 swapping is if for example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059316_0059420 okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059919_0060901 and at the end this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer which will recognize the user is voice and then it will act accordingly
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061477_0061773 so this is a proposed model
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061773_0061987 now the marketing expert has to
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0062120_0062796 give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0063532_0063628 yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0067684_0067788 and yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0068745_0069236 no these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons on both sides
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069236_0069323 yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069916_0069948 под ним
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069986_0070147 the menu yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0070404_0071261 these two are to increase or decrease the volumes okay and these two are to scroll the program channels
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0071408_0071569 screwed up i screwed up the channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0073384_0074001 yes it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0074001_0074203 so that which can be easily that the user really
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076128_0076730 and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076730_0076808 a shell shape
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076928_0077026 right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0077093_0077224 he goes right back
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0078678_0078822 or something like that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0096360_0096459 sim branco
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0098878_0098991 okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0101930_0102129 yes we do have special points
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0103669_0103947 that is the price
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0104663_0104891 nice points okay yes

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165536_0165724 we can always improve
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165869_0165978 is features
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0171906_0172054 always bearing in mind that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0178402_0178668 yes yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0180493_0180786 a little bit more
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0185498_0185849 celebration
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0188429_0188486 thank you very much
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0190292_0190402 they say it is forty minutes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0013037_0013522 she was challenged on that point that is right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0039502_0040024 you used to have all the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0042228_0042451 oh that is good yeah that is awesome yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0046289_0046397 or led
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0052441_0052514 menu
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053828_0053902 of the screen
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053902_0053969 this
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058041_0058417 the next channel in a numeric pattern or
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058778_0058833 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0059376_0059485 okay yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0062821_0062982 okay well um
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063112_0063579 what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063579_0064261 you can really hold it in one hand you do not need two hands and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0064511_0065246 the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065246_0065653 turn it upside down or have two hands move it up and down i really like that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065653_0066194 you really did a good job on that my little designers
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066194_0066948 and i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066948_0067118 that is a really good yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067220_0067346 so you really
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067786_0068008 the color is very attractive
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068008_0068633 these buttons around here are the mute
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068759_0069052 so these the front buttons which are here are the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069159_0069314 on both sides yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069314_0069519 so you can push either one yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069703_0069948 and this brings the menu up on the screen
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069948_0070393 this brings the menu upon itself and the orange ones are
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071210_0071387 it is so often
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071387_0071489 school after school
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071589_0071843 that looks like something i could sell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0072104_0072410 okay and now i am supposed to i have one question
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0074373_0074971 that is a good point because we need the symbols because we are going into an international market we can not have anything that is language dependent
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075356_0075447 symbol
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075447_0075544 text or something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076158_0076217 one more feature
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076855_0077167 for the snail right we have the snail shell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077167_0077358 he goes right back into his shell right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077358_0078888 well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail was known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0078888_0079032 that would really work
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0079632_0080257 i think voice recognition is our big selling point because nobody else seems to have that in this price range
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0080981_0081579 yeah well i think that everybody is going to say the remote control is practical
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0081579_0082128 i think we have to dwell on the appearance
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082128_0082331 you are really going to have the bad things
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082445_0082708 cutest remote control on the block
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082708_0083555 so i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083555_0083713 and i think those are the two things to push
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083713_0083762 the look
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083897_0084011 and the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084011_0084185 they are going to be our two selling points
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084556_0084761 i am supposed to make a little presentation are not i
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0085663_0086259 but in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086517_0086566 yeah that is me
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086744_0086822 okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086822_0087076 sorry
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0087076_0087088 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0089556_0089598 that is right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0092477_0092677 can you just fill them in the yellow boxes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0096533_0096673 i guess it still will occur
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0097975_0098164 rubber because we are going to have the soft buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0098936_0099082 okay the special
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0100797_0101105 no but we did not put the clock in it after all
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0112217_0112448 i am gonna take my file down so you can look it up
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0113791_0113889 cash
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114272_0114502 okay why do not you go just to the next slide right away
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114688_0114846 yeah i go okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114846_0115717 ok well obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first ask the big question will it sell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0115717_0116800 and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we have not thought of
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0116800_0117268 we can not accept every suggestion of course but maybe we just need to get a few
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117268_0117552 and show the prototype to consumer research groups
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117552_0118356 we do not want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we will not sell any
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118356_0118628 so we have to get some input from those people
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118628_0119064 and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition we like it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119064_0119388 we think it is good we are going to get behind it and sell it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119388_0119535 next slide please
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119781_0120514 okay now the things that i was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120514_0120928 i wanted the shape to be biomorphic i did not want anything with angles and all square
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120928_0121283 i want it to be comfy and roundy so we have got that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121283_0121644 size is small the color is bright and warm which is what we wanted
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121644_0122239 we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122239_0122686 even though it is going to be hard plastic it feels good in your hands so that is nice
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122686_0123207 and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0123207_0124124 so paradoxically the other features in other words the look the feel and the shape that is what people are going to get in the store
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124124_0124344 they do not have a television in the store they can not play with it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124378_0124658 so they will be our main selling points
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124658_0125417 so those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0125417_0126043 okay so the shape i think is a one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126043_0126301 that is really really excellent shape
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126301_0127341 the size is small and these points are in the importance for the marketing these are not in how i feel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127341_0127967 i think that it is plenty small enough to sell but i think we are sort of right the scale is one to seven
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127967_0128408 i think we are sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128456_0128620 and our color i think is great
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128620_0128975 the colors are bright and warm and really do a great job there
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128975_0129552 and given the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0129552_0130090 and then functionality i think you did a really good job on functionality
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0130090_0131014 obviously we could have added different functions but then we disturbed something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0131014_0131379 so i think that basically we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133143_0133582 well we had what eight euros twenty as our cost
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133730_0134107 and so we have still got four year olds to go to spend
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0134602_0134830 well um
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137150_0137939 well as we know in today is technological world you can do just about anything at any price the problem is quality
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137939_0138351 so we are just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0138351_0139103 and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0139103_0139488 as we have seen with so many of these kind of products
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141252_0141534 well is not this my last slide
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141607_0141656 good
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141656_0141844 i think that was my last thought yeah

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142596_0142934 and i am supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142934_0143589 and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now so if you put my last slide back up there
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0143817_0144241 i am sorry yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0144660_0144894 well because i can not remember what i put on

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152066_0152323 and then how about how we do on color
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152668_0152819 i gave it away
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152819_0153059 i really like all the sunspread ones
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153405_0153617 one one okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153617_0153839 and how about a single
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0154126_0154680 taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155051_0155410 okay i will give it a three two one i will give three
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155687_0155789 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155919_0156691 and the next is functionality where i admit i was a little hard on our team here but
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0158686_0158775 do okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159432_0159557 well um
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159803_0160156 it looks like we have got ourselves a pretty good product
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0160156_0161362 functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about maybe having a career and having another meeting
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0161362_0161910 but otherwise i think we are ready to go with this product
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0162068_0162501 does anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we should evaluate
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0167642_0168775 well then again if we are gonna do the speech recognition thing there are gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0168775_0169598 so that is where we are going to have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0169598_0170293 and then maybe we can do something with the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170425_0170535 the volume control
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170535_0170789 we can put that all on one button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170918_0171804 and a couple of other maybe consolidate some of the usage and see what we can do with that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0177170_0177576 i am pretty happy with it it is something i think i can market
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178213_0178697 i think you have done a good job yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178981_0179274 i think we were brought together as a team
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0180322_0180811 maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182205_0182421 and we used the slide because it was better positioned
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182537_0182670 i think absolutely
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0183545_0183798 i think we were very good
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185190_0185260 yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185896_0186554 today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them we have champagne
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0188646_0188930 watch out i have my cord behind
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0190501_0191179 yeah we have time but we do not have to we were told we could end the final meeting at any time whenever we felt we were finished yeah we did not have to finish
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0191856_0192197 i am taking a rest i will shut my microphone off
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0192517_0192575 there we go
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447 i was gonna draw a cat too so
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812 let us try something here
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060 and here from dunn garfield
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246 mine is a bit more skin
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971 well it is supposed to be a cat
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118 i like to be fair
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106407_0106456 yeah

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0109049_0109083 to draw attention to
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0126778_0126843 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256 they were all mentioned
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673 morning morning
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955 we zien jullie op de andere plekken
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125 are you really sitting on the right place
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629 guess so
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003264_0003336 tch
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809 here so i introduce myself
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274 everybody knows me i am barth
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415 see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801 let us start off with a little presentation
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834 first i will tell you a little bit about the setting
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037 you can see a few cameras there
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797 they will record our actions and you will have wires and microphones that will record your voice
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416 there are also some microphones there but you do not have to pay a lot of attention on those
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014 ik kan ze welsparen aan je doe dat meteen oké
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424 this is our project documents folder
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919 there are some notes in it already i see documents
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145 i will start with the presentation kickoff
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968 to be more better administrated
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206 okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375 i am figuring out a mission
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227 well i do not know if you have noticed but we are waiting for real reaction
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529 it is a company in drawings
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476 het is een fashion electronics je kunt het werken met veel effort in het ontwerp en in het product zelf
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865 i am mark burt i am the project manager so i will direct you through the project
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177 this is our agenda
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771 we have our open grant installation and as you can see we have a discussion class in
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902 maybe i can sit down and i can take some notes or let us see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442 maybe you can take the mains sure
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136 i do not know it is not a lot of work but just if you hear something just let it out
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525 as you can see it is the opening i am going to install it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917 yeah i painted this point fifth down a bit
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314 have you all seen the corporate website already
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701 have you seen any flaws
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949 i think i found one
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019352_0019396 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753 see you at braxtage
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054 does not work yet
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335 okay another program
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274 but on the corporate information side there was real remote instead of real reaction
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934 real remote is not really the company we are but god i know
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335 okay what are we going to do
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735 our project aim as you can see a new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113 and thus the original trendy and user friendly
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811 so these are the points why we also irg
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629 we have got a marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214 and industrial designer that is also user friendly in the original
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776 and we have got our user interface design
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206 that is about the new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089 project metal there are three phases we are going through
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568 first functional is a design with which you work meeting
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992 after the facial design then the conceptual design then the detailed design
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683 i have some little indications over here
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177 but i think you know it already lay yourself
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124 the industrial designer is going to work on the working design components design and a bit of the look and feel design
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102 the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design user interface concept and user interface design
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0031102_0032189 and the marketing expert was doing a little bit of user requirements specification trend watching and project product evaluations
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473 that is a bit what you are going to do
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816 but this will be a hallmark to us all amazing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524 then we have got our first tool training
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263 we are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here so it is handy if we have a little bit of training first
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870 as you can see we have got the smart boards here and here and the whiteboard
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579 in the whiteboard here is a little toolbar on this side
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682 here are some functions
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790 so you can say
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251 these functions we do not have anything to do it only undo you can undo a little bit
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563 piece of drawing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897 a blank new document for each person
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144 select pen eraser
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423 get you redone there is to do anything with
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867 then got our pen
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005 despair
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928 it is really funny because you can draw with it on this paper in the i think it is formo
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305 you can also select the current color and align it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673 but then first you have to select the pen function
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011 which we are going to work with in a minute
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261 good
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873 it is very simple and it is easy to draw your bindings and drawings in there
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081 then
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513 a short thing about documents
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935 we have got our shared folder project and project
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279 wordt jij een document geslaagd
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895 but you all found it already because there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697 and these are available on the smartboards as well so if you have a document you want to show you can just open it from the following
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097 here is the sample toolbar
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751 so they just said it is a brand move back or forward one page
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947 i will switch between the different drop
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479 and then we are going to try out the whiteboard
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119 so as you can see we are going to draw an animal
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785 just to get a bit familiar with it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932 no it is because i am running away
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351 does anybody see anything with the nut
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721 we are going to draw an animal
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367 and just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213 the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different line width
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607 i can start from there
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177 you can use the spin by holding it like a little child
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801 because if you hold it like this sensors will get blocked
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366 another thing is you have to be a bit slow
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895 because if you got me to draw really fast then ben will not hold up
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051895_0052898 i think grey is broken
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052898_0052990 day in the life
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502 eighty seven that will be nice
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863 now you will see my drawing okay we are good at this
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193 продолжаем
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579 oh he has to go real slow
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800 ah trying to draw a doll on this note it is helping
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204 sorry
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330 it is gonna hurt
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775 another function
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063 by the eraser
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197 and i can not undo
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576 list
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878 that is good
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429 and i am going to write down a few of his characteristics
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744 субтитры предоставил dimatorzok
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469 ik kan teksten ja
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677 this is typically a new action i think yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107 maybe i should hold it a bit more
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408 that is the same
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073 i think that is it because if you want to add anything this thing will be a strut
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319 i do not know just try
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182 it is another mile
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320 there he is
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929 thank you so much
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068929_0068980 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319 this might have been
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319 is my great characteristic about the dog
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477 this with the
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194 so now i am gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407 go ahead
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838 maybe it is easier to draw with a smaller line width i think
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126 because this is going a lot better than i did
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983 it is nice
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669 it is a real dutchie
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081 yeah recognition yeah let me see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551 maybe you can also write your name somewhere
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084551_0084628 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666 ja ich denke
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351 ja jag skulle inte
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283 is it your cat or did you find him on the street
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818 so everybody knows how to work with the whiteboard now
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508 if you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the whiteboard just ask and go ahead
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679 it is sunday baby
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677 we have been haunted haunted by a ghost
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990 so we got the tool introduction
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506 move along to the project finance
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430 as you can see for a remote control the setting price is twenty five euros
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648 question price
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946 our profit aim is fifty million euros
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775 that is the list we have to get from our remote controls so we have to work together to reach our aims
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717 we can do it internationally so we have to focus on different kinds of users different kinds of cultures and different kinds of trends as well
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143 but that is all in the vejda stadium
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933 onze productie kost maximaal twelve five euro
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883 so that is also a point we have to keep in mind that we will not make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060 bonne nuit
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394 so just try to remember these points
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393 selling price twenty five profit range fifty million but more important is the international market we are trying to focus on
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770 and production cost maximum twelve five euros
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275 so that leads us to our little discussion
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783 you have got about five or ten minutes left for discretion
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140 so i am gonna sit down i think
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442 it is easier when you go less
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622 i have got a message
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120622_0120698 fuck this
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118 okay that is a good time so just on a side note
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952 maybe you have to say the magic word say it yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208 this is a new one
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553 maybe you have to just clap it down
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122828_0122914 back up again
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568 and selection
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123733_0123799 itself
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948 let me just put it back on that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102 o que é que é
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649 instead of sedentals
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124998_0126251 but some everybody has experiences with remote controls and i mean not the ordinary remote controls but also a little bit different ones
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555 like you can use for other no really
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0127905_0127958 hmm
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777 yeah i have got one at home
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653 and you can program i think eight different devices in it you can use it for your television okay anything else
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326 and it also operates on infrared so you have got a little device inside your room
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868 and you can operate it from the third or second floor oh really
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716 so that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or dvd player downstairs and you have got a link to your tv on the second floor yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893 so that is a pretty handy
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460 but i would need a
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401 i think if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control it makes it a lot easier as well
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133401_0133481 cheers
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757 it is good to remember
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250 yeah it is nice i think it is a cheery duel
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482 so we want different functions
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420 and we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720 but i do not know if it will exceed the production cost
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021 so this is something we have to find out i think
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893 and other functions for remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329 you can make it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137725_0137806 approve
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500 so these are a few things you can think of
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030 i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040 so i can see battery status
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726 that is an idea yall
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142726_0142792 on our eddies
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142928_0142988 quick idea
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680 any questions about this presentation
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793 kickoff presentation
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790 okay then i will put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048 and then i can all work
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405 finish reading now
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955 en we zien alle werken van haar eigen project
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455 okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639 for a good life

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595 i do not know i am just gonna draw it here
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089790_0089839 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352 you know what that is

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580 okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751 now it is second floor
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137604_0137671 sure
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110 waterproof
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494 eh you never know i mean
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0141037_0141123 okay how much
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004079_0004149 marcia
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004810_0004844 thank you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353 fave
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0018307_0018353 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267 i can not say i paid much attention to it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0021216_0021268 oh yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0046928_0047006 that was interesting
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892 i do not think you know the short fiction
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0071206_0071246 love it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584 okay not much normalitis but there you go
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833 this is my um
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320 i moved up there and sprayed on that butt spot
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084648_0084705 yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084935_0084977 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049 they are really following through right
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144 they are really really cool animals
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316 and that is just a little meat thing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191 so pass it back to our usual interviews
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667 garfield
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0110215_0110298 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120296 let me go
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414 so just on a side note why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0123611_0123667 of it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159 well it was on
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124708_0124779 oh there we are
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126746_0126820 well yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508 kind of brought tv at home and the dvd player so they got like a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030 one for the tv one for the video recorder one for the dvd player
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442 and i think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0130808_0130852 group
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967 so i think you can take minutes again
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0134155_0134240 since june june
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478 but that would be really good if we could do that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534 i think it has to be shockproof
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045 my remote control tends to fall off
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381 yeah one other little thing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763 i thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140875_0140940 so you can see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213 how much is left in the battery
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994 but they will also really drag up the production costs so we will have to see about that too
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437 but maybe just a little bit
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0144083_0144179 i hope so
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0145529_0145582 i am just you know
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0147202_0147250 you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232 well i think if we are going to use a touchscreen we are going to go way above the twelve point five euros
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266 so it would not be very robust
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531 it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777 okay i have got a presentation about the working design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003 the quirks about how it works
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099 it is really simple
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285 everybody knows how the load works
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468 you should press the button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999 the remote determines what button it is uses the infrared to send a signal to the tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301 the tv switches to the frequency are functionally
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811 so we have got the place
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206 it is got conductive discs for every button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983 when the user presses a button a signal gets sent goes to the lan and transmits it to the tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340 it is a very simple advice that you can just be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614 so this is a schematic overview
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802 we have got the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017 power source
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468 and when a button gets pressed it goes to the chip
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059 the chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324 when you press a button you can actually see you have pressed a button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094 well i think we should use default materials simple plastics
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441 keep the inner working simple so it is robust
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841 i think we should focus on aesthetics design and user interface
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301 because if you are going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105 you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it comes back in every product
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046 so in my idea it is going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250 that is it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073 i think that if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i do not know if you have heard about it in the news
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281 the elderly mobile phone
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249 if we make a remote control just with that idea in mind we could make tons of money
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872 we do not have to focus on the design then but on functionality
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940 we just
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346 change our focus on the project
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636 we can sell this
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330 i am not good at it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275 and besides that if we are going to focus on elderly people they will have to adapt
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548 they are not used to using scroll buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860 perhaps we should stick to the basic layout
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426 it should be possible yes good
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604 it is not too fancy
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913 and if the remote stays rather small which it does
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902 so we are just going to focus on the extras
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548 like with a keychain if you buy so and goes
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974 i think we will have to choose between the docking station on the screen because
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187119_0187191 so that is good
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094 i do not think they have different television sets
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344 in every country
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002 everybody finds place again
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370 cheers
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777 okay so this is our second meeting
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100 and still fading
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726 now we are going into the functional design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007726_0009245 the important thing of this phase is that you are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements technical function design and the working design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719 so that we can move on to the second phase
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959 but first this face
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273 uh there was an announcement
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705 there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288 there is our ghost mouse again
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018 that means that you can have a little trouble with air conditioning
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339 that is the way c and e
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853 so it should be over in a couple of days
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438 maen mynd i fod yn ddiddorol iawn felly dwi ddim yn meddwl
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584 than our agenda
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747 nah first the opening
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911 this time i will take the minutes
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375 you are going to have a presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502 all of you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365 and we have got forty minutes for the whole presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769 so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354 and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291 and then the decision on the control functions which you want to include those which we do not include
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511 i have got forty minutes for all of it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947 so i suggest let us start with the first presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134 who wants to be first
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337 maybe it is easier if you yeah i think you will tell it in your presentation as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787 which function you have and what are you gonna talk about
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054004_0054103 thank you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516 anybody have any questions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829 and let us finish our requirements
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054829_0054905 okay that is good
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160 yeah that is it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571 yeah you can take your time
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860 and we cut theblanket sides
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0058229_0058319 coders
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638 i am not going to throw a bet there
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610 when you ask questions about the technical function
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654 well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727 yeah that is true
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130 maybe we can first listen to your presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669 and then we will have a little discussion about the requirements
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351 i think it is going to last a time
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0102358_0102401 thank you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926 okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724 i am the project manager so i am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739 we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0106739_0107827 en dat is omdat het te complex zal zijn en de tijd om te markten zal te groot zijn als we het voor meer functies willen hebben
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096 so it has to be simple
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600 another point is we have to skip the data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108600_0109601 because in the world of upcoming internet we think data tax is going to be a thing of the past
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069 and it is a function we do not need in our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739 internet is also mentioned just go in a function we can use
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063 maybe also on televisions it will be available as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672 another one is the customer is forty plus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578 that is the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257 this is a bit pity for the marketing expert
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682 because he was aiming on the younger persons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200 so we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648 remote control and the other way around
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449 and we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026 so it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572 and we have to be very clear on this point as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721 so i suggest
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215 let us have a discussion on the control functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0117632_0118925 any product requirements we can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091 against the null data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107 step pretty
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383 i think we can not
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238 i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970 if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with two or three buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577 or just a remote which is suitable for the market you want to reach because it is forty percent of the market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305 and if you look in holland the whole generation of forty plus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992 fifty plus it is the biggest share of the whole population now
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668 but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456 that people think that is the device i have looked for although i did not realize it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604 so let us try it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136353_0136447 it is a big success
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731 make a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367 we do not have to focus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011 i simply think
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830 that the new products we are gonna make are specifically designed
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726 are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0140860_0141918 and i think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419 because what you told the channel selection is important
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809 volume selection power and data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055 no we have not voted yet so i think data text can be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587 it can be a function as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776 but only if it will not
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134 higher the cost
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705 because i do not know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well but i do not think it will be a problem
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019 where is the lyrics
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751 so i suggest think it definitely
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374 is anybody really against data tax
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956 just keep the data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477 that is a good idea as well especially for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786 maybe we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123 make that um
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725 another point of advantage in our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587 if we make a button for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173 for elderly people that they can think oh i want to have subtitles and push the button and they get the big subtitles
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064 so i think that can be very useful in our advantage
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617 functionality should be few buttons you said
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239 i think that is very important we have a few methods
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701 so to keep it simple
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318 but do you need a wig
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219 we do not need it do you need the buttons for a while to cheer up
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339 maybe
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911 maybe you can use it if you want to switch from
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797 maybe you can implement the scroll button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154 or joystick like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450 there are other ways too
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649 if you look at telephones
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168 the sony telephone as a scroll button which was very useful in searching names or
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0163536_0163590 sure
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236 this is the numbers there
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076 yeah we can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display and if it is too much we can reconsider it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328 but i think that will not be very much of a button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493 but i do not think
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082 i think it is very important in the design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763 you can make a very fancy design by putting the buttons in the right places
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041 if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339 if you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393 so we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172982_0173031 sure
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434 so you should just we could better focus on for example the docking station
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717 like other functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210 instead of lesbians
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671 do you think the docking station will
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115 is allowed in the budget we have
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504 it is not too far
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153 i think that is
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456 that is a good advantage point as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363 if we have a fancy looking docking station or that is a nice requirement
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0179483_0179580 the demonstration
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0180046_0180112 i think so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259 that is a good boy
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868 you said they easily get lost as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939 so maybe we should implement the audio sign or something
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706 so you know where it is audio signal should be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126 i think it is not too expensive
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279 another
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692 oh and the lcd screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591 i do not know if that will rise the cost too much
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291 thank you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015 twist that lcd
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170 just a normal screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190317_0190417 små skridt og ved
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679 to some extra info
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060 i think that is a good idea as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584 it is the small screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580 כספי בטנד אינפו
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270 i think it should be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639 um let us see what did we say
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233 absolutely fancy design easy to learn
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469 q buttons you talked about that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768 document station lcd
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087 general functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280 and default materials
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196452_0197489 i think that is a good idea as well because other people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688 so it does not really matter
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944 a thinking problem
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316 and let us specify the target group
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966 are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687 because i think what we are going to design now is for people above sixty maybe
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201043_0201135 what do we want
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925 if we want to profilate us with for example the telephone for elderly people we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252 targets are real elderly people
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905 so i did still want to go through
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535 and you are talking about sixty to eighty for example
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642 and different cultures
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205642_0205713 barbie
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008 we have got five minutes left
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0207008_0207094 and with
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360 in different languages
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085 or you have to put a language button in it but that would be a bit unnecessary
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464 it is better to put it on different markets with you know
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880 so that is the tour i guess
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323 and then a few small things
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808 okay
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226 i will put the minutes in the project documents folder
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102 what we are going to do for the next reading is the initial designer will do the components concept
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432 goons interface designer using interface concepts and trendwatching
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212458_0213492 so just keep in mind things we have said about the target group and the requirements and the trends which are going along
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955 and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385 so thank you for this meeting
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656 and i think we have a lunch break now
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936 so that is a good thing
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139 okay
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775 ehm welke noem ik het ehm usual interface of iets ja
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117 for the techno function of it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658 um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215 i think we must use the general functions of the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0059215_0060963 i have done a little research on the internet but i do not have much information about it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113 i have been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844 so you have got a lot of devices like dvd television stereo
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948 chill bro
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317 but it must be used friendly
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041 so you can put a lot of functions in one
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588 everyone remote as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064588_0064676 but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479 um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318 ik heb veel functies in één remote control maar dit is een vrij simpel remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014 ik heb een paar bedden maar deze remote control heeft veel bedden
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502 people do not like it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347 i was thinking about keep the general functions like ar
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665 like the on off button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974 keep it yeah like a red button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596 en iedereen weet het dus je hoeft dat niet te veranderen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183 personal preferences
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706 gebruik het display voor de speciale functies van de verschillende apparaten
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070706_0070792 so um
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491 well i was thinking about you have got
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217 this is the remote control you got here the general functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145 like the on off button sound i do not know here you got a kind of display
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438 there is a touchscreen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074438_0075919 so yeah you have got the general functions of the device for a dvd player so yeah for playing reverse etcetera
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452 hier hebben we de echte knoppen voor het selecteren van een device
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0076586_0078034 so this button has already vr for every device you got a part display of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621 dus je krijgt nooit alle knoppen op één apparaat
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045 that is my idea about it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323 um yeah and
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706 uh let us see
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945 so that is green
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395 en de echte knoppen die we moeten gebruiken
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994 we can use quite large buttons for the lens
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294 everybody has to use it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664 well of old people young people
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268 also you must keep buttons quite simple and quite large
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577 sure
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082833_0082896 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237 het was mijn car
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427 yeah i do not think so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751 you got a quite cheap touch screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069 it is not in the corner or something
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648 it is just one call
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683 ik heb iets gezien op internet niet vandaag maar een paar weken geleden
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961 you have got yeah quite a
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685 kind of a touchscreen for
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287 twenty euros or less
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515 so it is possible
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0089662_0089761 yeah that is true
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395 deaf people need teletext for subtitles
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506 so it is yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0150585_0150660 for elderly
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617 mean it is only for tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713 we can not skip this place so we do not need it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000 into love
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0018276_0018355 i think i will go first
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813 my name is shrek samoan
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965 and learn experiment
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091 you already knew that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426 i have done some research
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302 we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556 we would love to fill out a questionnaire
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822 we had one hundred of these test subjects
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220 in addition we did some market research
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526 see what the market consists of
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664 what ages are involved
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460 well these are three quite astonishing results i thought
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753 remotes are being considered ugly
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963 seventy five percent of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633 people questioned indicated that they thought the remote was ugly
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285 an additional eighty percent indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733 in addition remote are not very functional
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332 fifty percent of the people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939 and fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028233_0028307 something
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894 then we did some research to do the most relevant functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664 channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867 the power button got a line
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117 and that is how to go to the section
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222 so these are the most
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700 most important functions of a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927 then there are some one time use function
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087 that is what i like to call them
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550 there are the audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074 which are not really used very frequently but are still considered to be of some importance
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702 channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943 one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502 and this is the market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115 sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty six
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874 the main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285 they like to use new functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438 but they also are very critical
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637 they will not spend their money very easily
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423 the users are forty six to sixty five years they make up forty percent of the market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731 they are not really very interested in features
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997 but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811 well i think this indicates where
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336 i think we should make a remote for the future
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480 and this means we will
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984 i have to focus on the ages sixteen to forty five
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938 this also makes up most the biggest part of the market so there will also be where our main profit would be getting more
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342 this would mean we would have to make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614 the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that remote control caused errors high
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217 this is certainly something to take into account
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921 and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn how to operate a new remote controller
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379 so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672 besides of course that the remote must look very nice
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933 functionality
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727 as a lot of people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons i think we should make very few buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175 this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670 i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162 especially the channel selection or audio selection buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539 because they are used most and so they should be robust
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695 they should not break down easily
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851 then as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room it might be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678 i say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985 but it might be a good idea to make a docking station
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629 this would get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890 so you know where it is in the room
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392 and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0050571_0051711 then a surprisingly great deal of people indicated that an lcd screen in the remote control would be preferred
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826 this was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436 mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805 but up till forty five it remains feasible
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574 this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0053859_0053925 that would be all
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0054420_0054490 quiff till
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050 and the top thingy
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058050_0058150 slide show
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058150_0058187 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837 well we certainly make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089544_0089606 that is true
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796 so is there any discussion possible requirements
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896 yeah because you are saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it is not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197 and new tv is will have internet access on them
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863 but i think if you are targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a dv with internet access
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278 within the next like twenty years is very slim
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133 in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543 so i think it is pretty dumb to put no total attacks feature on it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840 i am pretty much against it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878 besides that i think the market for forty plus is like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123983_0124063 pretty small
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873 but i think we are just gonna go for another
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439 not innovative
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125565_0125638 i think we can do a
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298 yes but it is not the biggest part of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973 besides that they are not very critical so i mean they do not really care
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315 what the remote control is like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688 they will just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961 i think that would be the case in the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414 sixteen to forty five age category
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077 because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605 people of forty plus i mean they wanted to work but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976 as soon as it works it is okay with them
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610 if we make a
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275 but obviously the board tends to disagree
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146351_0146443 so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971 i was thinking it would definitely be a bad idea not to include that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038 i do not think that is really an issue anymore
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154163_0154263 well might be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858 i do not mean for tv you are not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329 you need the one to zero button on the next channel previous channel
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821 volume up volume down and some teletext buttons but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360 i mean so we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508 if you are going to include teletext you do
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740 i think many people like to use that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506 if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five you do not want to push the next channel button thirty five times
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525 that is true but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089 i do not think there are many tv is that can switch channels that fast
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238 and so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899 the tv would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220 i do not know if many channels
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162420_0162508 do have that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612 i do not know if i can put any tv sound on
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063 but i think if you are gonna make remote control only to operate a tv there is not much you can gain on
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497 having as few buttons as possible
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313 because i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a tv which already only have the minimum number of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540 i do not think there is much to be gained in that area
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001 that is true but i think there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only to operate only the tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897 if you have a remote control only to operate a tv there is simply not a lot of buttons required
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553 there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184 so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602 marketing
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173040_0173099 which was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663 one of the arguments to make it only for the tv because we did not have the time to market a lot
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845 yeah i think i mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153 but i do not think we should spend very much time in that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428 yeah i think maybe we should do some research into
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733 what other people like to have you know
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039 like to have x ray and remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443 yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote control tended to get lost
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188 iawn dynar hyn rwyn ei gynghori
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919 you have it on some phones too which have a docking station
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252 and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0184328_0184403 so you know where it is
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701 i think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355 and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928 it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which will explain a button if you press it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068 which would tell you what it does
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747 and it would not have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469 just a small screen on a tube
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307 i do not know
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635 it was too big
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437 i think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0201108_0201183 i think if you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807 i think that would be if we should do something like that it would be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198 i think it would be really good for the image of the company
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681 and i think there will be a good market for it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211 they were able to really bring an innovative product
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648 yeah do it again
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196 i have to look into it a little more
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517 and with the little screen in it which explains the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794 i think it would be a lot easier to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113 adapted to different cultures
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0214713_0214775 that is good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673 bunker components design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321 for the energy source we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829 kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360 but if we choose for that option the docking station could become obsolete
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601 so i do not think it is really an option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583 for the casing the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing single or double curved casing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859 and it is really up to the design that we are gonna use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347 it does not imply any technical restrictions
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153 as a case supplement we could i thought of that later a rubber belt like an anti slip
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677 for the buttons we can use plastic or rubber
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326 and the chipset it says simple here but it should be advanced because we are using an lcd
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026 and as the treadwatch presentation shows people like wood
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725 but it raises the price and it does not really fit the image unless we would start two product lines
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913 fforwm sgriwth olaf bob tebyg arall
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554 and well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817 but depends on what we want
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047 i think we should discuss that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706 for the case the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523 and the chipset really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0091523_0091576 that is it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992 yeah there are four options
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273 you could use the basic normal battery
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436 a hand dynamo
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719 but i do not think that is really an option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113 you do not want to swing before you can watch television
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261 solar cells
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667 but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099667_0099767 or the kinetic energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754 just you basically shake your remote and then it powers up
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101742_0101816 it is true
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402 i do not have any informational pricing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632 so i will have to ask the manufacturing department
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810 that would also go for the lcd screen then i guess
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165 a bit higher percentage
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714 and that is the best choice
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947 well there is not any choice there because we are using the display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100 so it is got to be advanced
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061 i do not know you did not know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305 i think i will have to be sure
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060 well the general like most older remotes are flat just straight
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699 and our manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved cases
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622 it would just only affect the form for as far as i know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003 so it is really just up to the design department what we are going to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236 it does not really matter for the price or the functionality
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537 pick one do what i can
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534 i think we should start by choosing a case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785 because that is the basis of building on
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151 got this to last guys
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358 from the side so see who can ride a long bit
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993 the single curve so i am not really sure what they are going to look like but i think it is something like this
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632 so this type should be better for you or better should prevent the stray injury a bit
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274 and the doger something like this i guess
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600 note those are the three options we have
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185 it is more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it is always above
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030 maybe you should just start on a blank page
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425 good afternoon
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837 food
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093 i hope you enjoyed your lunch
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346 and it is important
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602 bye
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309 one two three
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844 okay this is the second phase we are going to discuss today
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162 het conceptual design meet in
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095 and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409 i will set your specification on the side
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622 and also trendwatching
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580 these are hopefully the points you addressed in your presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215 um first i will show you the agenda
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404 first day opening
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621 now we have three presentations
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142 after that we had to come to a decision on the remote control concept
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383 are we going to make it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600 and then we are closing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800 about forty minutes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221 so yes let us get started
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747 did someone encounter any problems during the operation
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182 one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty forty forty one forty two forty two forty three forty three forty four forty five forty six forty seven forty eight forty eight forty nine fifty fifty fifty one fifty one fifty two fifty two fifty three fifty four fifty five fifty six fifty seven fifty eight fifty nine sixty sixty seven sixty eight sixty nine seventy seventy seventy one seventy two seventy one seventy two seventy three seventy four seventy five seventy eight seventy eight seventy nine eighty eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one eighty one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011182_0011256 it is nice
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177 then a little thing about the last meeting
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469 these are the points we create on
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758 new brands in the target market
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012758_0013769 our requirements are a teletext docking station audio signal small screen with some extra button information
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987 and we are going to use default materials
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661 does somebody have any comments on these requirements
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611 these are just things we thought of so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else just let me know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755 maybe you can work it out
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334 and we are going to target the sixty to eighty year old customers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402 so now everybody knows what we are doing i suggest let us get started with the presentations
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012 so you keep the same lineup as last time
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452 i am from there
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736 any questions about the treads
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365 okay you go to the next
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0091739_0091784 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432 so that brings us to the discussion about the concept
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825 so these are the points we have to discuss
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318 um of course
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021 i think we can talk about the energy source since that is
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908 has a pretty big influence on production price and image
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011 so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927 i think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077 well i think it is true elderly people just like to have everything in place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773 and i do not think they like a remote just laying everywhere in their rooms
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157 so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369 and also what you said
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186 you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964 but i think it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441 so you have a button on your docking station that you can push and then it starts beeping
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214 and then we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the channels
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396 i am wondering
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198 it is a great way
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438 yeah which is february
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477 good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791 easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961 no i think it is a good point
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054 i personally think the lcd screen we want to use with the extra information i think nobody has anything against it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507 it is just some extra information and it is easy to ignore as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757 but if you do not want to use it you just do not use it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889 and yeah i think maybe we have to discard the voice recognition
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431 because it will increase cost significantly
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946 and i do not think it will be a lot easier to use as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372 so that brings us back to the energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126 if we do not have voice recognition it will not use a lot of energy to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356 so in that case we could use kinetic energy but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466 that much cheaper as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353 okay let me just choose for the battery
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484 that brings us to the chip
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847 we are using the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465 okay advanced chip
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455 and then we get to the point of the case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119 which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652 if you want to choose for wood or the black and grey
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732 or both
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723 as we saw wood is a lot more expensive to produce
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033 but i think it will attract elderly people who want to have something exclusive which they can show off to their grandkids
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275 okay i have got the new remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399 that is right
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850 the woodcollar was a lot more expensive
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515 i think so because yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064 it is a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896 in some instances
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794 i think that is a very good option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768 because then you can advertise as well with give your grandfather a new place for his remote control or whatever
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796 because that is something extra it is something other remotes do not have which we can get a greater advantage point
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959 and then you can make a mousse color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145 black and grey all the colors as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770 so you suggest we should design two different telephones
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830 on which you can apply different case covers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767 so everybody is okay with the changing covers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059 i think that is a good option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555 change in case code
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318 but the form has to be
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677 it has to be possible to stand up
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912 just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416 and the cover of the documentation is also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749 van tovább a televízió innen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158749_0158792 or not
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180 yeah you can do that you are kidding
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369 it is okay
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722 so the interface
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048 wat voor interface willen we gebruiken
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709 maybe we can make a little drawing of it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144 on the board
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381 does somebody have ideas for a forum or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252 yeah his views will be a lot more difficult than mine
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349 but you have extra business
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495 so people can get confused
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086 especially if they have the same writings on it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234 can not we make a remote which you can flip over and use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173340_0173417 all the same
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789 functions as the normal one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194 then yes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292 and you are good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482 yes i see his grin
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107 what else to take
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553 blessing in the name
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069 no it is not very handy i think
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520 because the plus and the min will be opposite
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813 no it is the finger
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100 peace
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349 maybe yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117 but is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262 i think the functions are
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981 that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589 sam wsiadłem
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961 i think we can just leave it the normal shape
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365 but maybe we have to
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783 make it a bit more fancy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988 in one way or another
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404 um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709 i suggest the single curve because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514 so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759 because it is a bit of an angle
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0197954_0198030 i do not think so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198497_0198586 good night
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153 do you have an upside down or do you have a that is dope
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581 so get your mask
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961 that is a good one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386 but i think it is better to put the screen on top
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339 so i just flip it one hundred and eighty degrees around and then this plate that is around here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592 if you can have this one and turn it like this
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761 and then get the other side done
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490 because maybe your hand is in the way if you put this way here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207860_0207900 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208151_0208188 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288 start on a blank page yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838 okay
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509 here to display the moon button
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175 and we can add a little bit of foam here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421 just that is for medicine not for anything else
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958 and then the rest of the buildings here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498 well still okay
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344 a bit more friendly
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215951_0216031 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512 a general idea of the concepts and materials we are going to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081 so now for the next meeting we will have to look at the fuel design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575 it is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819 so check out the corporate website maybe
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286 the user interface design is the same sorry
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527 and product evaluation
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198 so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771 but you are going to get your instructions i think sent by the coach
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642 so just i will put these minutes on the in the folder
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0221860_0223007 and then we are going to try to finish our project and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394 which are let us see
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233 i am not sure if you are going to start right away to work together or i think you are going to fill in the questionnaires first yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361 and then you will get a message
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778 so listen that is good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026 nee dit is wel
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240 i can save this one in the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225592_0225685 for this group
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653 all right that is it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788 smart boy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235 so if you wanna have a look at it it is over there in the projects folder
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764 and then i guess we will start in thirty minutes again
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227926_0228011 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943 to the end
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820 um okay um yeah this
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237 some research about the design of interfaces
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969 last meeting we had about using a few built ins
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534 so that is what i want to
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088 to do in our design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675 so finding an attractive way to control the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406 i found something about speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725 so maybe we can use that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241 yeah and using a little display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584 um finance
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263 just to focus on the primary functions
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0052279_0053386 so only a button for sound for on off shifting up a channel or down shifting it on
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794 let us see
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0054053_0055076 we hebben een nieuwe attractieve functies nodig die mensen voor het gebruiken van de app attractiever maken
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904 so i like speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247 just as we mentioned last meeting
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736 and yeah overall user friendly
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079 so using large buttons
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127 het is mogelijk een vrij goedkope systeem te maken voor spreeksreconisatie
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078 you can think about when you lost your remote control you can call it and give a signal
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315 so uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059355_0060394 and for shifting up a channel or for putting out the sound or something
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972 you can just give a sign say sound off or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248 and uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666 television put the sound of
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061979_0062017 cheers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062017_0062107 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754 ik dacht aan een speciale button voor de subtitels maar ik heb er maar één voor om het makkelijk te houden
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187 met één druk op het knopje krijg je kleine set titles
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204 double push double click so you get big subtitles for people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965 hoe kent u de green small subtitles
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167 so um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977 ja en we moeten de generele knoppen blijven dus de knoppen die we moeten gebruiken
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608 the on off sound higher lower and the numbers zero to nine
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499 the general button more general one button for shifting up shifting down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0067499_0068547 we willen ook een klein display gebruiken om de functies van de knoppen te laten zien
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546 we kunnen een functie bouwen die de televisie installatie aanbiedt
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161 also a little picture of a
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824 you can put on off button over here in this corner
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571 bijna alle afstandsbedieningen gebruiken de afstandsbediening op de plaats waar je op staat
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271 zodat mensen de knop herkennen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416 so um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043 display of it it is just a small display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312 and you can put it on top
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615 so most
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199 de meeste mensen kijken vaak naar de
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041 a special button for shifting up and down a channel
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585 om te lezen waar de taal van de
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038 dus je kunt gemakkelijk omhoog of omlaag schakelen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404 to quite a
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077560_0077623 and play it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316 so and all the functions for subtitle one with for sound
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304 en het overige ontwerp moeten we over praten
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573 and that is it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0103973_0104066 what is the function
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374 yeah for running up the batteries
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104502_0104541 i am a rapper
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864 i will not use much energy i believe
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811 het is een klein display dus ik denk dat het op één batterij zal dragen voor six maanden of meer
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293 so i believe one battery is just enough
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0107293_0107332 so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0109111_0109182 nice
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0122010_0123074 maar dat is een beetje een groot lcd display of een klein lcd display die we willen gebruiken
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359 i do not know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497 is het mogelijk om een veranderingsgeval te maken
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140497_0141783 dus eh eh je hebt eh ja met mobiele telefoons eh eh dus eh zoals de nokia ja mobiele telefoons eh wanneer je de kast kunt veranderen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143 maybe it is possible possibility
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0142143_0143382 je hebt alleen nog één standaard remote control en je kunt een paar
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139 we kunnen gewoon de regulaire vorm gebruiken maar dat is niet heel fijn
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0162139_0162213 show
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324 for left handed users
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165576_0165671 yeah we are gonna have to
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715 het is mogelijk om het programma op de linker of rechterkant te laten schakelen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669 en aan beide kanten knoppen voor het schakelen van de geluid
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929 um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0168784_0168851 is a fuse
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0171079_0171166 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417 see um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825 or you have to make a left left
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980 i mean um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0174074_0174165 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0181030_0181088 okay
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486 just using a thumb
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687 so yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832 yeah building on yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195579_0195663 as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040 you say it is um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849 so you want to put the display over here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945 now it is they have an upside down or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055 yes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194 this is that is the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199194_0199283 this out
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043 maybe it is possible to make this side like this
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425 uh to make this right and
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217 a bit like so in the form of your hand
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202217_0202304 so um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202446_0202545 uh it is
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157 so the remote control has to lay in your hand
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536 so uh it is full uh yeah so we will get your
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151 and put the buttons for
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620 changing the channel over here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644 so i just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150 og med display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060 i do not know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061 like on your mobile phone
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875 i mean
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463 maar onaf beter nog steeds op de top
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0002409_0002464 caution
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300 i will start off that quickly
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995 ok i am done informing you but i have been trying to watch you here danny over the past few days
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224 we have done some market research
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610 i mean distributed some more on cats questionnaires
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021670_0022728 and besides that i deployed some trend watchers to milan and paris to get a hold of the newest trends
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525 and i have consulted some additional trend watchers as the original trend watchers return about what the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088 the best design would be
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509 okay these are some overall findings
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960 the most important thing is the fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462 the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239 innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776 by inoperativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839 about half as important as the inoperativeness was easy to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0027839_0029193 for our group we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty years old these factors are slightly more equal
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830 these are some more group specific findings
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102 the older people prefer dark colors
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533 they like recognizable shapes and familiar material
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093 our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633 the material for older people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031633_0032764 this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that a robot should have
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520 this leads us to some peripheral preferences
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933 the remote control and the docking station should blend in in the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226 in the room
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797 so this would mean no eye catching designs
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557 just keep it simple and well docking station on the small screen would be your main points of interest
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270 because this would be the innovativeness in remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896 so this would be very important that we at least include these features
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036896_0037901 well the trunk watchers i consulted and advised that the remote control on the docking station should be telephone shaped
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470 so you could imagine that the remote control would be standing up straight in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085 this is pretty much a new shape to polar people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958 also they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170 so it would be kind of more telephone shape
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0040266_0041314 besides that we would advise to bring two editions one with the wood like color and maybe a few and one with the grey black color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809 the wood like for the more exclusive people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998 people with more money
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227 the great black color for well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730 people who rush me
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203 there would be all
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043635_0043711 trends
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370 and how exactly does the kinetic energy work
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100370_0100424 just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747 and then it powers up
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706 well personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499 and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267 and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559 get great popularity for a product
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007 what is
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196 yeah you could load up batteries you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720 it is true elderly people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954 i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557 because in our earlier market research if you would allow me to yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235 nah it is just so big here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594 and we also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369 if people would pay more for speed recognition and remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827 like you can see here our target group would not do that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229 so if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667 i would greatly advise not to do it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175 i think it would be better to insert another product that is meant for that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0118321_0118391 number of people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924 um well this is yeah but this is here the question was would you prefer it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250 so that does not really mean they would not pay extra for it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970 and on top of that the lcd screen would help in making the remote control easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773 and i think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744 well this was for like an lcd screen like you would have on most of the mobile phones
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971 so pretty large
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803 i think the most important factor there is the wooden color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136 so it would not actually have to be rude yeah it was just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0138485_0138558 food color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574 you get a great advantage
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670 we would have to look carefully into the design though
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517 because we would have to make one more control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798 plastic cover
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153 yeah more original one more standard one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094 well no i think we should just we should then just design one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867 one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305 so but that should not be too much of a problem
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151 i heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curve yes yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312 could you explain that a little more
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954 and what would single curved and double curved mean
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539 so we can pretty much just pick one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156788_0156823 that is good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967 no just to lay down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229 cover
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889 وياربي شايزي
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200 you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you can
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156 so your thumb would be easier well i think that is a very good point because i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause rsi
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342 so it would be great for that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900 i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355 for left handed users also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860 bye
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985 um well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721 yeah we could do that but i am not sure if that would be very good for the ease of use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0169396_0170527 but if we would make a changing channels and volume button on both sides that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940 because it could be made all symmetrical and stuff
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0171552_0171617 that is true
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0183930_0184002 that is true
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919 i would have preferred a cornice to be round
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215101_0215191 kingdom
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215435_0215516 i am young
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0227946_0227988 お聞く
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318 well this is what me and richard came up with
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630 the default spot for the on off button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914 the new button just below that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143 then there is the volume and channel selectors
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651 cyflwyniadau cyflym
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832 we thought of a help button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459 if you hold it and you press another button the help goes to the lcd screen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006 then there is the zero to one to zero buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210 button for teletext
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412 button for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547 and the company logo
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108 so it is rather simple prototype
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509 and we will have to see from testing how the users take it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603 sure
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857 thank you see you luca
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312 most controls they have got more buttons than this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651 and well the on off button it is a necessity
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827 again drop that one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305 volume and channel buttons you need you obviously need those
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014 the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295 so we could cancel that one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198 i think the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796 so come
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107 leave out the number buttons i guess
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775 it is rather basic already
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707 yeah there is no more plan
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038707_0039817 they are supposed to be equal sized rather with a little logo on it for the volume the triangle just to recognize
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922 so i recommend it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860 so for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160 with a different color than the case
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326 felly gwblhau
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672 okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531 and that is a big cause
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589 if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402 de docking station is niet zelfs in deze schematiek
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799 no it is not even taken in at a price
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439 you could save money on it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909 but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432 my mother can not even send an sms message
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716 the margin
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859 any other
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535 we are getting closer
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608 you can just not scroll for half a second
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915 that is fine it is you against me draw that to the end
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041 if you want to use an lcd screen you need an advanced chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942 if you could just leave out one more button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104845_0104933 大家再见
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706 what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015 eight hundred and eighty eight
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125 je kunt er twee knoppen uit maken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299 and just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820 if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160 so that would save two buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291 if you do the same for the challenge
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0125541_0125614 more obvious
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0127499_0127588 shall we please run
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190 if we leave out all those buttons perhaps we can go with the flat case
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350 and make it smaller overall
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493 so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button the screen right under that then the scroll button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801 you get a much smaller remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131028_0131056 and the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171 richard argument all these changes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0173211_0173289 the noaa file
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147 yeah i have not saw a good one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014 i think that is a free
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412 i still think it is too fancy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585 to do the ashiyo
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806 is this like after this are we done
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0199991_0200038 that is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434 yeah there was not enough room to finance
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207148_0207215 yeah it was okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687 the tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step it is very easy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414 the smartboard the drawing is just a pain in the ass
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773 the digital pen is very nice
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110 flip over or more precise
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0214261_0214361 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0217626_0217690 i am not sure
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023 considering we are not going to make a docking station
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0002698_0002756 no problem
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551 it is those moments this time of day
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665 start a three m club
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211 yeah let me see
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450 our fourth and last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004774_0004870 there he is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801 okay this is our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236 in this meeting we will discuss our final design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073 and we will do some evaluation about not only the product but also the project
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473 and then we are going to close the project today as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027 so after that you will be a girl and a man
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951 this is a detailed design meeting we will discuss the look and feel of the design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616 the usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053 um in order to go to this agenda
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431 we will have the prototype presentation first
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847 then we will set up some evaluation criteria
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128 then we will look at the finance
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851 we would love to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264 everything costs money and the more furniture you want to have the more money it will cost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897 so we will see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106 we will see that later
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608 then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797 we have got forty minutes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313 so we will be finished at half past three
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458 but first
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059 we will do the prototype presentation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536 to some aspects of the form
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033 but i thought in a few meetings earlier we try to keep it simple
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364 just a few burdens and large burdens
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914 but i think these are all together quite a few buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558 i am wondering if we really need all of those methods
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0030283_0030338 bitch
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0034073_0034143 but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567 i do not know they seem so tight also yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300 so yeah it is something about the design of the buttons there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660 yeah normal player
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042770_0042859 it snows
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583 then because we only have thirty minutes left i will move on to the compilance part
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103 which is pretty exciting to see if it is at all possible what we want to do
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313 and i can tell you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184 we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half years
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093 if we see i do not know if i filled in correctly so just correct me if you see something wrong
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275 i counted two batteries
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449 but maybe we can also use one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571 i do not know
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046688_0046778 the tree show
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046778_0046829 there we go
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569 it is two euros oh okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771 i̇leriye ihtiyacımız var
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964 sarı adnan şifre
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445 to save there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674 here we have the single curve
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330 we can see that the difference between uncurved and single curved is one euro
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0049567_0050630 i do not know but i think the single curve is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771 i think we have to keep the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207 then we have the case material supplements
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051207_0051288 it is plastic
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551 it is the cheapest one we need
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892 so that is not much to save either
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253 but then the biggest costs are the buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124 so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our cost low
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846 because we would have to get the twelve point five euros at the end
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498 so if we let us first count the buttons we have now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741 correct
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171 not a lovely teaming weather
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282 nathan rose
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363 okay including the help
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577 i am so good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973 i think we can discard the help and the mute button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577 by pressing down volume or pressing down a number
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157 that saves us one hero already
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347 dus dan ja koud fifteen nog een keer
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058911_0059003 this is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638 yeah those are the ones
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761 yeah but it is not staggered in this it is just a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582 so maybe you can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189 that is the possibility as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747 so and it is good for the design as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063747_0063844 so you can make
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253 uh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373 i can make this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283 please click right here
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604 cross
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938 it is cheaper
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067938_0067994 the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755 i think they can the material
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434 i am the chick
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069640_0069710 uh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069710_0069759 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476 but i think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one bet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612 yeah no we did not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110 maybe a little bit then it seems to me that it is impossible to make it so in half euros
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807 also the lcd display i think it is too expensive for the display we use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166 i think they tried
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535 that is right but what is the big advantage of a remote then
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858 taken in underbrush
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075858_0075946 that is the next step
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075946_0075992 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577 that is an option
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108 i am going to close the video
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625 do not you think we can if we can count this as one button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335 and integrate these buttons in three then you save a lot of money as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0079648_0079729 it is clear
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216 yeah but we have to stick to the twelve and a half year
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758 we do not have any more budget to the margin
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085451_0085521 tales
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913 if you leave out the lcd display
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188 and if you use less petals
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824 you can not use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445 there it is yeah shoot
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876 so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0088391_0088466 to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850 rwyn credu
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606 or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programming
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091774_0091815 mbc 뉴스 김재경입니다
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155 that is not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082 and we put it in the stoves
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674 we are getting closer god bless
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454 new york
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956 or maybe you can
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416 scroll
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856 if you scroll you will see the number on the lcd display
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061 until you have got the right number then you push it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800 push button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289 okay but then you can push some other britain gin
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097773_0097811 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288 you scroll to a number and you wait a half second then it turns to the channel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412 yeah we definitely crossed
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634 and being better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440 and the regular chip is not possible
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541 it has to be at twelve
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028 you need an advanced chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674 now you can save a euro by a flat design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510 that is an auctioneer game then we are almost there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103221_0103313 so if he
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097 yeah but i think that is a big advantage
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780 can we integrate the data text and the subtitles in one button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181 pretty much
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035 that could be
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0110185_0111458 i think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738 just make it real simple
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275 goes and saves saves a lot of money
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622 and we can keep our lcd screen which can provide extra information
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798 en je houdt hier het schoolbeeld
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097 i will leave this the only mode of ambiguance as subtitles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870 en het is ook goed voor het innovatieve design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054 keep moving your eyes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936 and
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970 i hope you have enjoyed this video
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0118202_0118283 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389 something like that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627 and yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119627_0119725 good scroll down
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301 one two three four five let us see if we erase this one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659 il est juste au bas de son son
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704 that is really a good idea
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742 will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious more of you see me
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440 so like one controlling mode in general
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540 so if you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127540_0127616 it is fine
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873 so we have got one two three
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246 yeah we can leave the teletext in if we want
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484 put some shovels together
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0129528_0129580 so if you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130183_0130236 mute
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130848_0130903 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131141_0131200 sleep
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599 i think we praise this one too
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0132777_0132865 you only have to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891 it is more the molds in which they are being made i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149 single curl it is really easy just fill in
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440 and the case is coming right out of the machine
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932 og tænke om gørsler og sådan en ting hvor jeg kan lade mig flade
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349 i think this is a really easy one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204 what does everybody think about a flat or single curved design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368 fré à youtube
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976 yes it gets cold
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138075_0138134 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138448_0138544 ah o que era isso
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061 we are gonna do some more research
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867 but i think we can keep the single curve as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423 just to express our lcd screen a bit more
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234 some people will use it more especially for the help functions it will be good if we had a scroll bar scroll button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583 will be necessary if we have a good health issue
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030 i think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412 yes definitely
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852 i am glad they could make it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487 that is pretty different it is pretty different
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0146301_0146358 to get
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692 so we are gonna
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147824_0147921 think the most
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713 changing a chain of so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057 we can lay beards we can stick it out
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709 maybe that is recognizable but i do not know
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882 시크릿몬
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380 so i am afraid we have to move on
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789 and it is less frightening i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461 i think it was
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0151710_0151804 so you are like what
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752 i would buy it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952 take care
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182 i would buy a paper and a sheet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385 no i did not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583 articus one hundred and twelve and i will be right out
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939 yes they are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590 but we can go on with the project evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070 that is it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185 okay so that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519 we still have fifteen minutes left so be nice on schedule
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017 the project process
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654 evaluation evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0156703 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972 that was the thingy the point i forgot
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157073_0157148 shit
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416 yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938 foot
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406 we have got five minutes i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595 no we have got fifteen minutes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0159654_0159733 yes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0160899_0160939 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947 yeah that is because my pen failed to upload his data
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409 i try to but it is getting worse by downloading software
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151 i think it is fancy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912 seven titles better than a goal
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763 so i have got twenty cents for our dotlookstation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172007_0172054 지금까지 뉴스 스토리였습니다
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577 that is a bit dodgy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279 i would say four
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431 four or five
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173431_0173528 continue to improve
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0174139_0174236 is it still showing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410 i think it is a seven
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373 it was
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514 i had them worked out
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276 they are ugly not very functional and getting lost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496 i think with a new radio button i think it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180601_0180679 i think it is better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0181167_0181228 see you in a minute
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495 that would give us four
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543 than we also do in spain
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656 bye
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737 yes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657 and they want to put fashion in their products
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820 in the slogan of the company
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250 we hebben de vervangbare frontkacen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526 so i think it is very recognizable
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302 we have got to come here again
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159 we have gone there we have gone to hollywood
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159 thirty nine
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0191694_0191750 what do you want
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723 i want eighty push ups
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192723_0192769 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734 that is eighty four percent
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531 i think it is a pretty nice score
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196264_0196309 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091 that brings us to the project evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969 project process
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284 did we move through the right phases you think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0198284_0198384 long process
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199215_0199260 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792 so lack of information about prices
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462 what is the room for creativity
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171 because of the finance
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519 they are roomless
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092 internet access
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292 was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819 did it work out
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206819_0206916 working together
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281 also you two of you with the yeah it was okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665 were the means sufficient for the tasks that we had to do
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854 or were they too much
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210536_0210617 i did not do it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227 if it will not download this data
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719 smart boys us we are dating
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663 so you rather want it to have a flip over
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862 or something like that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403 faster as well yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214952_0215006 so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117 you need a smart board application i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463 but actually important life
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606 that should be a good one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760 yeah you can export this image
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036 yeah it must be
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673 so the sharing of information was okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973 yeah it is work
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141 yeah i have been here all the time
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0221553_0221616 it is possible
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160 that is nice
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383 we found new ideas for
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719 having this kind of meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853 so everybody puts his own score
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438 yeah it mediates the score and you can get one yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629 bis bald
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773 so it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226902_0226980 are you cool
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875 any more ideas
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035 for questions about the project
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187 to our better product
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027 because i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842 let us see who got to our last sheep
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225 articles within the page
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759 considering we are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184 stage
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323 bye
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942 but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459 and i think you can compensate that as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053 so i think that should not be the biggest problem because it is very cheap to make as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536 do we think we are going to get the twelve point five million
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728 what was it fifty
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002 christine christine goddard
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226 i think he will
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421 if you are going to export this product
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631 ciao in der offenen zeit
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796 wish you a miracle
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996 people are really thinking it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923 for the younger people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789 it is pretty normal for everybody
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421 you can change markets by changing the front cover
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648 that is one thing you can strangely do
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492 so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the mark
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596 just as a test
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780 see you ibirds
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960 that is i think a good thought
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889 i think we can have our little celebration
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243008_0243104 it is party time
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641 i think we still have to put in one more it is a champagne
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243641_0243727 let us see
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243727_0243778 i do not know
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907 i did not get a message
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644 from the ending of the i believe you do have one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766 five more minutes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244766_0244857 oh that is good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441 then we still have some questions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777 if somebody has some questions they can ask them now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188 you can put these in the project folder as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0246188_0246256 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137 explore the earth
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996 this is another
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380 somebody is seeing roger fuller
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0251380_0251450 very good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252084_0252182 all right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373 yeah i was a little bit mad at the end so yeah that is okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073 i think i am going to make our final presentation now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994 me i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292 summary of the project
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455 i think you will get the questionnaire in your room
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867 and then i will meet you in ten minutes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257911_0257969 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676 hopefully my pen will download its software
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258798_0258869 for
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520 that is just the normal remote controls
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092 you push it you come in page one hundred
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492 je kunt de normale one hundred and twenty knoppen gebruiken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251 but you can also use the button for changing the channel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597 so the shifting better okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145 for shifting up in the text and shifting down
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0028020_0028081 yeah just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0032664_0032723 my gosh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076 or you can build it when you press one button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430 we just discussed that already
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841 but we think all people do not know that option
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336 so they just put it in the put a corresponding belt on it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0036106_0036142 you know
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0038595_0038650 yeah good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039621_0039712 좋아요
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870 just to recognize it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252 and we do not need a led or a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216 sommige remote controles hebben dat maar omdat we het kleine display gebruiken moeten we het niet gebruiken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353 yeah so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989 да я век и не идиоть
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640 god i never should have
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055647_0055737 fifteen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074 yeah i went to help but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059797_0059890 i think there are two
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170 uh it is just one better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336 bit
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809 pour une grande barbe
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278 but they are more expensive than the small ones
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447 see ya
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922 just a average
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814 but i do not know if it is cheaper
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508 so uh yeah we have still got four buttons but just um so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393 you got another bit better itself but on the chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825 yeah if you have got a deal for a better deal
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0070187_0070270 yeah but we could use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323 we can buy a remote control when you can use it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080323_0080403 so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080795_0081905 we moeten onder de twelve fifty blijven
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675 it is total
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308 but it is possible to make one for twelve point five zero
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0085405_0085486 i do not think so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769 but you can not use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698 mi akarunk
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326 pinde zo fancy en goed ja
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709 wait no it is a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083 attractieve opties
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571 so you can stay below twelve fifty
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862 it is a gross one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091964_0092017 night
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725 in the actual fitness
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0102171_0102209 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643 ja of we moeten de ondertitelsknop uitkijken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896 i think that is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203 yeah it is a big trenches
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445 but um can we just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104854_0104924 off your jam
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420 but if you push the zf middle slide
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106593_0106649 the stage
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180 one uh one but a few but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0130811_0130845 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737 je kunt een vrij groot remote control maken voor precies dezelfde prijs als een klein remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154 je moet alleen betalen voor de dubbel of de enige curve
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380 yeah it is a bit
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0144166_0144215 bleh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881 oh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245 maar ze weten de scrollknoppen van oude radio is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690 en daar ook zon knopje om de channel te veranderen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848 so we can maybe it is a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341 but it is very special
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0169428_0169515 and here we go
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172293_0172354 get right to it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113 i would say
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379 four hundred and five
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0174813_0174866 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045 yep
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054 that is a free
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961 we have to test it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151 true
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0183216_0183313 i think i have got three
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0184600_0184659 bye
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0198655_0198706 avec le chat
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034 personal
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998 als je wilt delen als je een foto maakt zoals deze op een presentatie
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302 it is easier to share it with other people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688 je kunt het opzetten en op de internet plaatsen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321 or in shared folder or shared directory
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617 on my laptop but no
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571 it is kind of exported like it should be
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894 да
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221557_0221619 possible
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0222830_0223899 yeah maybe just give the numbers of
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0224017_0225098 het is makkelijker om dingen op de computer te doen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564 so just like a university
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0232341_0232375 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0243410_0243496 go to session main
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498 تعبني في
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875 maybe a day will save it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252875_0252954 so yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986 maybe you have to fill a i will do a questionnaire
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256986_0257044 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471 that is all
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765 sorry i am a little late not a problem
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891 could suck on your traffic
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337 is this the moment where we can ask questions about the functionality
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526 when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you go to the next teletext page
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009 thanks sean
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127 that is what i pointed out earlier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580 if you just make a control for just the tv there is just not much to gain
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624 since it is rechargeable
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604 would not yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058664_0058737 that is it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435 i assume you count the volume and channel things for two buttons each right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016 i think i see the two buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891 i was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402 that would cut the cost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849 i think this reviews for buttons any
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689 on the documentation of this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247 maybe we should move to a different supplier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213 nu mai am de ce sa luam
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340 well since the market research
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439 indicated that other people spend their money easier more easy maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715 especially since we have those west features
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761 if you need help there is some cd is to play
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089659_0089691 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089831_0090913 basically it becomes a choice between either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017 but i would have schooled you to work here
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447 that would bring up the price of the scroll and so on
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836 dwin credu bod y cyllid yn dweud yna
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096836_0096923 put it here
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523 i think that would be like the end of her usability
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0099189_0099267 you after
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892 i think it is pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button go to page eight hundred and eighty eight yeah and then the text disappears
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058 but sometimes i will stay there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387 dwin mynd i sgroi
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498 i could be able to scroll to the eight click scroll to the eight click scroll to the eight click
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376 but then again there would be just pretty much no option for older people who do not even know what a scroll wheel is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108535_0108604 holding it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349 remote which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761 with only five buttons on it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109976_0110054 and it is cool to you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143 it is a pretty big skull
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621 so this is fine
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884 right now we are in for better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803 well i still think we should go for the single curve design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008 let me go
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451 all these changes are not really okay with me
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601 but since
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137769_0137865 i will just have to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255 i will just go to the board and
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782 get us eighteen dollars a remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228 we will do some more research and see what the options are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362 it is pretty hell of an
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959 this is not really like for the group you were making
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152 this will really require a lot of march team
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482 we do not get this to sell
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297 because older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426 this is not familiar code
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830 so we are going to have to do a lot of convincing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151389_0151436 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580 might be confusing to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151720_0151805 do you like what
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906 only five buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944 but you are not sixty
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394 so i like set up all these criteria
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642 evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339 five more minutes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865 okay so this is some literature study analysis of the requirements we set up earlier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347 translated the voluntary criteria which would be these
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584 this is remote fantasy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756 shape looking film
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137 what new functions are there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162137_0162232 e a d u
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741 learnability is a very important factor here
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952 is functional
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317 there are not too many functions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740 and are those functions in zendaria useful
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163740_0163825 and the cost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164080_0164162 the target group
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617 this is the remote wheelie for the coop we are making it for
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998 and break up mobility
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536 if our company is easily recognizable then our company made it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081 so we are supposed to evaluate it right now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166423_0166471 she
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260 i have to say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0167371_0167425 okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001 suv is are not fancy on a scale of one to seven
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635 they were going to sandstix
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392 um can we sign in over to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929 i can tell by lcd is subtitles the gold buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030 should we do them yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181 it is the design easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172780_0172879 would be for us
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0173579_0173666 go for a walk too
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438 is the design functional
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714 do we have all functions that we want to include
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174849_0174943 you think we do
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151 do we have too many slides
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175151_0175235 i am not a teacher
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175235_0175320 pretty soon
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990 oh and dewey
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676 take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833 like it getting well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301 it was a happy father dad one it was
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0177301_0177351 soon
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770 production costs with preset links
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178770_0178849 you wanna leave right now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698 does not design fit the group of focus
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180138_0180230 think of the new
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180815_0180879 it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181091_0181152 see
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034 i think the radio button is not exactly what older people expect of a remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0182989_0183036 i want to show you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172 i think i would go for a g
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632 yes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738 yes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762 i was also supposed to calculate the score but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353 i thought we would have a vi  private we have got to gomeet after this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785 is this like after this are we done
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100 and we are going to tell you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189254_0189335 bye
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567 these are self effectors time settings for the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356 nice one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964 screen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191089_0191157 intro
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499 so maybe minus eight
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834 forty one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134 i guess i just type the name
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171 so it would be a bonus
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145 should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442 in de design phase
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0201763_0201840 not too much
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202278_0202335 yeah true
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157 and i would have liked to go for the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420 younger users also
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833 and just to be able to access the internet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0204002_0204098 get something of your own
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573 try to open the file
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217671_0217762 not by
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219000_0219096 you do not have to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219812_0219863 doshi
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0232490_0232532 damn
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767 fifty
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237264_0237626 yeah i still do not think i mean if we are gonna make a scroll button anyway
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244 it would be more for the younger people than for the older people yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405 so maybe we should just refocus
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004 okay specifically for your finger table
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0239502_0239563 that is true
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758 i think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is with older people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0241921_0241996 older people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325 even if it were their covers
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121 sporty pun
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0244479_0244521 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0253017_0253106 love it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515 you are supposed to make
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688 are we supposed to go into our own rooms again
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0259069_0259156 is that the right
