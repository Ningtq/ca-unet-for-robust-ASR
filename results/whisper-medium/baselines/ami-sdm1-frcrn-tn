AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0001232_0001522 so that is all we need to talk about
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003404_0003804 there you go
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003804_0004372 ooh i dropped mine as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0004372_0004550 this was not a good start
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0014258_0014411 so that you can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0015240_0015280 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0019299_0019342 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0020774_0021798 i guess the bottom makes a bit more sense because otherwise you do not really know that oh what if i right click now what happens then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0021798_0022021 well no you still have the menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0022494_0022568 it is more like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0023119_0023309 like if you want to add more things in the future
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0028511_0029029 i guess i
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029176_0029382 browsing sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029382_0029782 more than the speaking characteristics as steve mentioned
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029782_0030242 yeah it is really nice to have it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033387_0033423 i
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033648_0034102 i mean i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034102_0034749 well if you get speed correction that someone talks a lot in a certain topic
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034749_0035495 and then if you click on that topic you get everything that is in that topic
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035495_0035633 that is still another
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035885_0035950 no no no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0047186_0047257 like we have to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048370_0048684 like show the speaking characteristics
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048684_0048784 then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0049626_0050203 but if you do double click on something do not you expect something to happen
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0050347_0050518 ちょっと待って
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0052255_0052654 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0053716_0053759 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054234_0054469 i am guessing the points are on the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054629_0054823 yeah what you are clicking on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0056192_0056252 single channel
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0064834_0065636 but well could not we i mean you probably i do not know if you want to have like the full transcription and the summary at the same time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0065756_0066343 so maybe you can just choose the same window for transcription and summary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066792_0066942 that is nice
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066942_0067089 مزيلة
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067488_0067598 cest lui qui a un grand tueur
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067598_0067821 yeah that job that big job
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069530_0069723 or just i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069723_0070329 yeah that might be changed to contents of the same window transcription to summary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0070453_0070496 kathryn
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071598_0071661 one different way of
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071661_0071729 we can do it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071903_0072556 no no it could be like transcription summary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0073967_0074082 what do you mean
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0075387_0075484 can you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0077778_0077821 just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079078_0079370 yeah well i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079370_0079997 but transcripts sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079997_0080387 like full meeting meeting without disabilities and summaries
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0081037_0081143 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084663_0084719 i guess it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084719_0085603 i mean just to try and i mean for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing yeah that is what we need to do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086073_0086473 just so see the integration works sort of between the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086888_0087101 so i guess that is what we need to do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088004_0088628 well i guess i mean that was probably our intention but we might not have written it down
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088628_0088867 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0094981_0095082 say that again
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0097561_0097613 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099449_0099697 i can tell you what i am an sb two
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099998_0100130 oh um i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0100130_0101160 i started browsing a bit just like trying to see if there is anything out there to use
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101288_0101585 i will put it in the description for the cast
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101585_0101685 everett files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101685_0101792 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101792_0102458 so you could probably just use that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103281_0103473 yeah well i do not know if choose both
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103473_0103608 i could have a look there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103608_0104072 but i found some code from a tutorial about indexing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104072_0104133 cool
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104458_0104529 yep
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0105467_0105681 so you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106017_0106053 i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106053_0106854 i was a bit worried about when we talked about this with files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106854_0107249 i mean how much do we actually need to do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0107249_0107771 like extracting things from the xml files and stuff to be able to do the indexing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110119_0110483 are you running in jala yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110616_0110841 i mean you should not have a look at
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0113394_0114347 yeah i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with vowel
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0114347_0114848 i mean if you already started on stuff we can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115519_0115636 should we i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115829_0115980 meetup and see what we can do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115980_0116747 i mean i do not know see what you have done and see what we need yeah when we know more maybe
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0116747_0116842 week so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0121416_0121534 yeah start attaching
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0122521_0122604 i think it is possible
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128171_0128615 but what is it like a window where you have to write it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128615_0128800 or is it just what is behind it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128800_0129035 no this is not the actual thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0129035_0129151 such this is just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0134560_0135831 when you like is there a open thingy or what do you like what did you do to like how did you figure out that this uses mixed seed search i do not miss it

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200596_0201020 we have one class at least when we use perception we do not have any lectures
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201020_0201252 but i think we are having like all other classes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201252_0201545 i do not think there was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202017_0202078 i think we are
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202348_0202617 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202617_0203004 i think the undergraduates had a word of

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206263_0206578 i do not know what to do with this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206578_0206731 i can not think basically said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206959_0207489 the same things as in the comments if i could read it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0207601_0208075 i am going to go on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0208880_0209062 i am just going to go there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0209487_0209690 that was not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210783_0210862 to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210996_0211532 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211532_0211708 that is pretty good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211708_0211786 youtube
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211914_0212391 if you are okay with having me
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213391_0213503 good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213503_0213747 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213928_0214081 is she still here
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0214081_0214159 bis bald
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0000358_0000538 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001320_0001372 чё
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001521_0002417 why do not we just go around and everyone says what they have been doing has anybody done anything no one
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0002417_0002522 lives
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003057_0003385 well i have got a browser now which whoops
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003385_0003440 all right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005038_0005142 so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005142_0005935 we have got a browser which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005935_0006681 and then when you go on the menu you can select the summarisation box which pops up and an audio player
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0006879_0007304 and i think the search works as well so you can pop up a search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007304_0007975 and it loads up just the background windows are empty and so when you start
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007975_0008475 mae angen i chi ddod or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle or cyfle o
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008648_0008707 that make sense
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008861_0009603 the transcription box has got a summarised button which does not do anything yet
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0009603_0010391 now i wonder how we want to do you know we want to pop up window with the speaker characterisation
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010620_0010958 either we could do that you know when does the pop up come up
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010958_0011582 either we can when you click on the id any sort of id in the transcription box
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0011582_0012313 or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012838 felly gallwch chi ddysgu ar y botwm a yna maen hynnyn hynny beth oedd yr holl cyfrifiad yw
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012838_0013481 the problem is the left click is already used because it highlights that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0013662_0014263 maer rhai o ddarlithiau neu beth syn ei wneud maer llwyth yn ei hwyso
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014263_0014755 so that you can i do not know what happens when you do not look like ashley
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014755_0015291 but that would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015291_0015579 i think so yeah when you left click it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015579_0016074 gallwch fel ymchwil adleur ymarfer yno i gael y audio yma dwin credu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016268_0016434 so we can not put it on lefty
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016434_0016638 we could put it on the right click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016638_0016875 we could for example have a little menu that pops up
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0017064_0017669 so right click on a menu and you can click on speak for characterization
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018003_0018170 that is a good point
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018170_0018296 oh
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018296_0018364 otherwise
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018512_0019136 yeah i do not know about you but usually in windows right click does not do anything with it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019136_0019281 it opens a menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019281_0019509 yeah that is what i am going to be doing soon
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019509_0019685 bit weird
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019685_0019789 stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0020464_0020661 or just you know or just the button
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0021828_0022161 well no you still have the menu pop up there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022303_0022415 well oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022415_0022683 it is more obvious is not it it is more of a proof is not it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022781_0022916 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022916_0023124 да это правда
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0023440_0023676 i have no words in that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0024560_0025014 that is right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0025014_0026007 actually what we could do is in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026135_0026438 i would search for that user
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026438_0026635 is that gonna be useful or too much
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0027270_0027918 ie felly pan fyddech chin ddod yn ymwneud ar hynny un pwysau oedd yw roi i mi gyrraedd gyrraeddwyr fel ysbyg
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0028408_0028527 or is that too much
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0029777_0029908 yeah it is really hard
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030101_0030163 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030163_0030404 it would be nice to have it interconnected
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031661_0031855 what do you mean by the speaker characterisation
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031855_0031976 oh well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032138_0032239 i do not know about that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032239_0032507 i mean the speaker characterisation is a bit like he said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032507_0032731 it is like a nice thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032731_0033237 we do not know we are not actually sure what the user wants for it but it is interesting so why not give it to him
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033408_0033513 i think we should do it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033513_0033555 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035475_0035713 yeah i mean that is still another level further
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035713_0035849 i mean we are not even there yet
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035849_0036132 no no no does not even pop up the speaker characterisation yet
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036132_0036419 you have to first define what happens when you click on the user
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036933_0037201 so should we try to do a right plug in unit
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0038786_0039120 yeah there is a second thing about the topics the topic window
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039120_0039859 you want to somehow be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039955_0040278 felly gallwn nin gwneud hynny yn y ffordd ysbrydol
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040278_0040500 so this thought is full of
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040963_0041128 so yeah this looks
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0041128_0042077 so we have basically two options of browsing the meetings is by either searching and opening individual observations
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0042077_0042413 and then we have the interlinking by right click basically
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0043540_0043601 double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0046279_0046699 buna çok açık bir şey yok
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0048635_0049016 but then there is a problem with a lot of windows popping up again
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0049016_0049385 and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050231_0050320 не
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050661_0051319 it is not coming up well then they close it it is not the end of the world especially if you have a touchpad
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051319_0051763 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051763_0052198 i will check what it does on double click at the moment
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052198_0052354 because i think it will do something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052354_0053059 but i really do not see anything obvious
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0053232_0053373 i mean if you can think of something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0054942_0055367 um yeah another thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055367_0055554 single audio files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055554_0055657 do we want to use them or not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056175_0056388 yeah the single channel files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056388_0056482 do we want them
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056482_0056539 i mean
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056935_0057083 i am excited to be doing it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0057083_0057836 we might use them to work with them but do we want to integrate them so that when you browse you can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058138_0058175 do you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058175_0058529 no he is not going to make much sense if you listen to it on his own do you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058529_0058566 bless
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0059290_0059432 thank you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061004_0061410 beth ywr bobl yn credu yn y ddiddordeb am y clwydrwng y ddiddordeb y ddod yn ei ddweud
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061410_0061622 do you think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061802_0062025 we need to have that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0062025_0062566 i mean i am very much i want to have everything customisable
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063100_0063186 we are not no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063271_0063546 two or three maybe
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063546_0063967 but yeah it depends i mean i really want to put the summary in somewhere you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063967_0064139 and the summary for example is typical
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064139_0064653 you open the window you read through it you might close it again straight away
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064653_0064783 i think this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0066465_0066707 i was just gonna say
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067015_0067093 سألت
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067093_0067298 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067298_0067356 that is right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067356_0067509 i am not sure yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067774_0067816 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067816_0068028 maybe you probably can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068028_0068145 i am sure
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068145_0068259 i am sure you can do anything
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069193_0069280 i can have a look
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069694_0069876 but yeah that might be changed to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074042_0074793 what do you mean people get used to it i mean when you use windows or linux for that matter you have a lot of windows open
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074793_0074870 to manage them
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075637_0075770 yeah you can minimize it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075770_0075825 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0076972_0077180 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077312_0077525 yeah they are definitely going to be in the same one
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077961_0078225 ie dynar plan ar gyfer y disfreniadau
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078225_0078273 so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078405_0078674 yeah do you want to do that with some reason
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078674_0078914 put the summaries in the same way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0079024_0079145 mutual experience
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0080411_0080636 yeah yeah you want to do that that kind of makes sense yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0081658_0082025 and finally the prototype piece of paper
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082025_0082238 what kind of prototype could be produced
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082427_0082876 because i am just you know we are going to the lab and i say what am i going to change today
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082876_0082966 no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082966_0083521 and it kind of just it just develops i am not aiming for anything
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0083521_0083648 do we want to aim for something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084151_0084417 i am pretty much getting there anyway to be honest
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084417_0084676 it is not going to be a lot more
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0086512_0086575 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0087635_0087724 no it is okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090041_0090334 like if we are gonna just try and take a look or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090334_0090526 i do not know if you can access other people is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091245_0091452 yeah sure
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091452_0091735 i do not know if it is readable at the moment but you can show it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092632_0092884 right well i will make that readable then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092884_0093251 felly y ddyniad yw fy nifer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093469_0093781 well this is not difficult what is your number
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093781_0093953 in all the emails
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093953_0094325 your number
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094325_0094677 a four a five a five a four a five a five a four a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five a five
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094852_0094906 six out
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095076_0095254 thanks for the five out of five
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095493_0095832 and then there is a folder in lssd
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095954_0096182 and it is called the end browser
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0096372_0096633 yes for eating
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097137_0097408 i am just kidding
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097408_0097519 i have got cold so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097519_0097586 i love foam
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098653_0098772 yep so that is me done
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098772_0098929 someone else want to talk about this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101141_0101294 what were you doing again
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101518_0101603 thank you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103010_0103097 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103097_0103239 you found some hope for it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103796_0103892 of making a tutorial
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0104071_0104139 cool cool
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105314_0105391 yeah that is handy
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105647_0105801 so you think you should not be too difficult
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107796_0107929 oh sí
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107984_0108254 i have to convert it to some sort of format
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0110673_0111508 i mean you should have a look at the browser code then because they already extract for example transcripts
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0111508_0111638 i am sure i do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117526_0117565 i mean
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117565_0117771 this week is only two days old
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119772_0119940 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119940_0120083 it was not what it was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0120083_0120184 she is so cute
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122509_0122961 i think that is really possible the browsers i use it now or as
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122961_0124017 it was there when i took it it uses the nxt search to get the data out of the files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124017_0124283 maen anodd ond nid ywn bwysig sut maen gweithio
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124283_0124371 do not quit us don
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124736_0125544 i fynd âr data fel ymgyrch i fynd âr data cyfrifol mae angen i chi ddysgu i ddysgu idio neu rhywbeth
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0126372_0126907 so they do not say look in that and that folder but they say search everything
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127599_0127915 it does blow down quite crudely
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127915_0128090 cest pas une sensationnelle fauteuil
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128090_0128300 but you know what how much did like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128916_0129092 no this is not the actual search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129092_0129792 this is just when you open you know to load the transcript for example to find the transcript for a certain meeting
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129792_0130668 it does an nxt search for the string i do not know transcript or text or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0131325_0132073 yeah so i do not know if you have looked at the search query language but it is like a dollar a text
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132517_0132635 and then yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132635_0133008 because every year all of these
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133146_0133367 these files have got an id
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133367_0133778 and all the transcript files got the string i do not know what it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133778_0134161 words or text or something in it so just search for those files
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0135749_0136115 um is it um well it is in the code
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136115_0136646 just that you define a search object and then you search that string
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136646_0136971 i had to figure out how to do the same thing for the summer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136971_0137045 that is the way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137199_0137656 i had to understand how they did the transcript to do the song myself
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137932_0138302 yeah just search for specific strings
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0138539_0139209 so you could just you know you could use that when you if you want to take the data out
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0139668_0140326 if you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140326_0140557 you know whatever you want to do then just send me an email
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140684_0140767 i can explain it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141071_0141221 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141221_0141861 actually in the moment it is got a load of rubbish because the browsers that i used from this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141861_0142167 that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142167_0142569 ac roeddwn i wedii ddod or ffwrdd or holl ffwrdd
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142569_0142648 just kidding
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142891_0143171 so they are all in there yet still

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0170421_0170824 oh and the search interface
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171085_0171814 maybe you should decide pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171814_0172395 and then if you want you can give that to me and i will build you a nice few dick boxes and drop down menus
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173031_0173365 oh that is that does not exist
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173365_0173753 that was completely cut and pasted
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173753_0173939 that does not exist
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173939_0174331 it is nice and warm it is quite a pleasant thing

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176358_0176565 it is gonna be a little difficult more difficult
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176565_0177317 yeah i mean i was going to but you know the whole drop down menus and stuff what we want to search for is not quite agreed on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177317_0177653 we never agreed on what we were able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177980_0178441 yeah do you want to just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0178441_0178929 and then we could discuss at next meeting which options we really want to include

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0090504_0090785 you can make it world readable than anybody can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0091683_0091941 i think by default they are
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0091941_0092409 they are only default then only you can read them
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0092409_0092544 you can see them but you can not really
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0093642_0093761 cuál es tu número
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0094000_0094135 दियो नामा
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0095296_0095388 and then it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0095883_0095940 системы
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096253_0096476 and browser
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096603_0096861 i hope you never have to look in my direction
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096861_0096996 it is just pure chaos
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096996_0098011 non
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0098011_0098236 files everywhere
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0099194_0099473 i will jump once
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0101383_0101731 all the searching stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0103100_0103274 made fast and perfect
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0103274_0103343 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104086_0104146 cool
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104146_0104463 so even if it does not work you can jiggle your plug grip around and make it work
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104463_0104502 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104833_0104923 yeah messing around
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104923_0104999 exclusive notes as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104999_0105058 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0105058_0105219 but the basics is that okay that is a kick
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0108343_0108907 i have been trying to write something to read the xml and get rid of it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0108907_0109230 ac gallwn in gyrraedd or hyn ond rwyn cael ymdrech yn ei wneud yn unrhyw lle
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0109230_0110041 felly bydd yn cael ei ddod ar y sgrin
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0110041_0110272 are you ready angela
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0110272_0110361 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0111440_0111661 yeah i am sure they do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112175_0112406 oh yeah i will
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112406_0112504 sure something difficult
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112504_0113049 i am sure i am making a mega bit of it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114572_0114667 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114667_0114752 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114890_0115025 się czery z możliwych sposobów
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0116729_0116852 next week
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0116852_0117355 i actually have not done anything this week because this week is been mad
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0117355_0118027 yes exactly i mean this week is only two days old well whatever it was last week then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118027_0118367 the week as it is rather than the f asterisk asterisk asterisk week you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118367_0118669 it is getting a little bit manic the last time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118821_0118966 that is right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118966_0119388 and then we had to do an irp whatever it was last week as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0119388_0119603 which is only a page one but it is quite difficult to write a page
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0119796_0120427 maen gwneud ond roedd yn ymwneud roeddwn in mynd ymlaen amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0120427_0120774 ja sprv goed ja dat kan
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0124483_0124642 so when i when i
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125645_0125768 that is pretty bizarre is not it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125768_0125866 but guess who is right what is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125951 i have got this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0126161_0126273 dynan bwysig
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0126718_0126828 yay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0127051_0127129 that is pretty good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0130698_0131380 for and it like it just has an open variable transcript yes whatever find everything that is got that and then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0132084_0132683 yeah yeah because that is the guy who declares a very modest name and then yeah because
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137198_0137323 oh see i am
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137664_0137928 so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is that what you did
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0139133_0139328 i was just thinking that you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0140885_0141114 have you annotated your code oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0141114_0141347 actually in the moment it got
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142482_0142647 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142647_0142936 mission critical
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0143627_0144045 commenting out one bit at a time

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0144630_0144709 good shot
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0145209_0145714 basically we go and kind of diss work
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0145714_0145806 the log in the short of it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0146177_0146599 still at the bottom of the mountain
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0146991_0148409 well should you plan to explore any other thing how is your quantifier raising
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0150042_0150192 you saw it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0151690_0152141 of course you should have picked something anyway
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0153784_0153900 i suppose so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0156158_0156528 i will be happy when this week is over
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0167535_0167757 so it is like two weeks

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0175667_0176204 that is not a very bad thing that is just so much fun you should make it like smith then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0177660_0177739 да если нужно
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0182306_0182820 you can take a search tutorial see how important it is see all the class paths all that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0183594_0183865 next week is on school
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0187312_0187486 not instantly

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0190469_0191133 three point three zero in the computer room in here can you get in the front door
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191133_0191290 oh ti ddim wedi cael cyd dwy
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191290_0191374 can i have a go

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192791_0192913 you do need to have a key for it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192913_0192972 that is the thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192972_0193082 it is got a lot of door but
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0193221_0193326 yeah somebody else

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194976_0195055 yeah that is pretty neat
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195055_0195472 and there is a photocopier with the code on it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195472_0195877 let us go there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197101_0197132 all right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197316_0197367 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0198132_0198470 hopefully it is not that manzo it will not matter
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202080_0202399 some classes did not some classes did not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202399_0202522 well it was already
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202522_0202670 they did not really know what was going on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0203437_0203591 no like i want
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0206074_0206171 oh we are trusted
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209644_0209866 yeah i think your comments are basically the same as what you said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209866_0209900 thank you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212177_0212273 vorsicht
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212600_0212704 sunny often
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212704_0212767 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0000096_0000665 i wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002147_0002311 no you are not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002707_0002820 sounds like you have done something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0019845_0020242 to just have sort of the same sort of medium throughout yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023050_0023188 but then it is not as expensive
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023188_0023463 like if you want to add more things in the future you can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023463_0023492 family
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023492_0023804 where is the menu i think it is more flexible
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023804_0024042 i guess
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024287_0024381 you can have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024381_0024516 i know instead of a button
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024516_0024746 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030336_0030633 yeah like maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030633_0030899 i mean speaker characterization i did not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030899_0031139 just some way to sort of leverage that information
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031139_0031547 like we have it we are doing it but how does it help the browsing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031547_0031789 or what can give us
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0036844_0036914 that is very good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037629_0037844 that is not just from me
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037844_0038530 is that from any particular window like if we want to sort of get like if we are on the users versus like a topic or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0038530_0038786 have a right clip for these various things
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0039767_0039903 right yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040228_0040305 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040426_0040582 and listen throughout
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040582_0040671 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042611_0042816 actually yeah like another common thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042816_0043260 like we have it sort of set up itself if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043260_0043622 i mean that is kind of a typical action
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043622_0044106 if you double click on a particular topic or something that it goes to sort of like a default view
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044106_0044434 so it will be like all the keys of that topic
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044434_0044882 either whatever we decide the default to be whether it is in all meetings or just in one meeting
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044882_0045291 and just show up the particular instances of that topic in the meeting
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045291_0045449 like i am just thinking to half of the default there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045449_0045889 os yw unrhyw un yn gwybod beth maen nhw eisiau ei wneud ac rydym yn gwybod bod hynnyn bwysig ywr pethaun mynd iw gael
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045889_0046271 so the door will do that instead of the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0046605_0046933 well it might come to us
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047144_0047355 like we have the right click menu
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047355_0047814 yeah right click but instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047814_0048253 maen bwysig beth ywr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr ffordd ymwneud âr fford
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050686_0050787 stop coming
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050787_0050871 i am not gonna close it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050901_0051245 no it is not it is not a little
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0056935_0057122 you started talking on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0061525_0062063 i think we probably need that though to have the full flexibility we need to have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0062635_0063079 well the thing is typically though is someone can have five windows open at the same time probably not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0063079_0063650 probably two or three of whatever they are looking at like dialogue eggs whatever but yeah it depends
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0064658_0064727 it would be good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066363_0066473 it is like having time there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066473_0066660 cheers
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0067707_0067992 i do not think that was a good idea
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0070776_0071251 yeah we are even just have buttons on it toggle buttons or something on the toolbar for that window
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071444_0071496 it is open
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071604_0071899 different ways we can do it it does not have to be a tab or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071899_0072058 no no it could be like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072507_0072576 or check marks
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072576_0072925 maen dda i gael ymddygiadau
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0073677_0073785 with stuff in the way
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0075628_0075840 yeah you can not mention me can you do that yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076219_0076581 like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluences out then we can you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076581_0077006 transcript without the dysfunctions
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077006_0077098 some of these you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077098_0077878 probably sort of using the same window and so we are going to be in the same one and probably mutually
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077878_0077947 it was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0080447_0080587 yeah you want to do that that kind of makes sense
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082308_0082395 into february
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082870_0083007 any comments
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0085854_0085988 and so you can put it in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089197_0089641 actually is the code accessible like the gui stuff that you have done there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089641_0090010 can we just copy the latest stuff out of your directory
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090010_0090601 like if we are gonna just try and like take a look or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090732_0091278 if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable then we know the directory to get in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091362_0091506 i do not know if it is
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091705_0091985 i think by default they are no they are not word readable
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0092565_0092653 아
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093261_0093398 pre congesting male
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093398_0093531 okay yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093531_0093627 yeah right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0096404_0096606 for eating
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101290_0101489 office searching
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101489_0101940 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102357_0102731 so you could probably just use that code like that was behind the question she asked him earlier
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102731_0103149 you know the reusing code and stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0103286_0103406 yeah well i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104422_0104524 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104524_0104872 i will probably still do some other file management
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104872_0105003 i am messing around
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0111840_0111900 that is great
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0115078_0115204 mm hmm libraries

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121271_0121856 yeah i was thinking the weekend probably yeah but start attacking this seriously
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121856_0122358 hopefully i will have something by next week that we can sort of try integrating into the gui
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0122504_0122604 it should be possible
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127378_0127795 well they did say it was not the most efficient
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127795_0128003 i do not quite
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0142505_0142623 okay so we are gonna do this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0144017_0144115 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145397_0145576 yeah that is interesting

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146004_0146201 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146304_0146826 still at the bottom of the mountain how many hours is this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0147120_0147459 to explore each other
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0148212_0148293 no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149554_0149614 for western
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149880_0150007 you do oh really
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150178_0150270 well i will do that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150288_0150408 these can be changed
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150408_0150546 so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150546_0150752 i do not know it does not matter
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150752_0150839 if you want to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150839_0151060 let us just play around with some extra stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0151060_0151220 i will see you after some time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153025_0153272 is that informatics of course
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153272_0153425 yeah so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153425_0153739 how about like digital
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0156246_0156562 i will be happy when this week is over
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157002_0157469 i think that is about it then anything else we need to discuss
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157652_0158052 did we want to meet before we talk to steve next week
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158298_0158434 well i do not know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158434_0159102 we will probably get some work done over the weekend so i know after dnlg or something maybe just have a real quick little update and just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159414_0159510 we can decide then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159510_0159565 exactly
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160177_0160605 you are gonna do the search
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160605_0160782 können wir da mal hin
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160782_0161336 it will be still a limited version of the next query
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161336_0161524 bye
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161524_0161669 will not be the whole thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161669_0161948 like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162062_0162239 actually you can just dial in the next
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162239_0162386 this was awesome
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0163096_0163352 summary topics
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0164731_0165115 yeah we get behind schedule pretty quick
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165115_0165239 like you are saying
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165239_0165581 well actually do we want to set a date for interim prototype
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165701_0165820 yn y cyfle
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0174020_0174401 it is actually odd
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0175200_0175308 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177666_0177789 да если нужно
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177789_0177962 so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0179495_0179561 to see what that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181028_0181137 so just like the basic
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181137_0181361 no worry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181742_0182107 just like all the unseen the code and just sort of how just to see the basics of what you have done
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182107_0182452 we just get a quick look over and just can take it so it is tutorial
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182497_0182770 or the class paths all that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182770_0183332 just say okay well here is everything is basically set up and then just you know just jump right in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183644_0183749 thanks for watching
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183976_0184292 no
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184735_0184862 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184862_0185309 well the thing is yeah something like that could happen anytime because yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185309_0185690 like my schedule is like a class break class break class
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185690_0185974 yeah exactly that is what i am thinking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185974_0186364 so something like that and then if i have a classic i can run off pick a time
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0186612_0186822 monday might be good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187025_0187110 forty six
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187237_0187767 anytime not at noon or two or four
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187767_0188059 no in between those yeah like one or three
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189157_0189286 yeah that is an option too
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189286_0189383 mm hmm
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189596_0189653 today is good
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190197 or three hundred and thirty
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190197_0190345 i just yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190345_0190549 that is a
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190727_0190876 actually we just had a skit in there though
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0191260_0191791 can i be getting we can get in through the through the big computer rooms in here
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192004_0192373 well if you find me i will show you where i will let us all in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192373_0192682 there and we can look at it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192682_0192781 yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193087_0193279 yeah somebody else
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193279_0193562 i was just asking steve about that whether we can get in there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193562_0193757 whether he was gonna get us access into it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193869_0193922 the computer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194295_0194371 it would do
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194872_0194961 is there a printer in there too
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195394_0195537 let us go there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195537_0195672 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195774_0196406 we could photocopy our assignment
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0196431_0196575 well the comments i am thinking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197063_0197125 nie ale
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197125_0197320 after you do that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197879_0198035 as long as dmlg does not go late
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199514_0199666 sounds like me
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199840_0199917 right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199917_0199994 well it is supposed to be
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199994_0200131 for a weekend
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200785_0200843 that is the council
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200979_0201027 pictures
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0201901_0202026 um something like that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202026_0202188 people want to come to class
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202392_0202622 it was all really they did not really know what was going on
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202622_0202650 i think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202962_0203257 he goes up to the professor whether they did it or not
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203257_0203347 well i do not feel like it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203347_0203466 okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203466_0203610 i think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203610_0204092 i think the ielts will probably have one to make up for missing classes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0204092_0204431 dil will probably have classes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0206079_0206202 we trust you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0207928_0208146 you want me to cover
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208436_0208731 some really wonderful windows from a single app
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208960_0209241 but most will probably want to go with defaults
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209692_0209717 from
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209873_0210490 and exactly just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topics imitation
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210621_0210766 i hope you enjoyed
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210766_0210858 muchas gracias
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0002480_0002851 thanks

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0006202_0006252 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008166_0008661 interesting stuff that you made here
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008661_0008947 yes
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0023120_0024443 let us just cut out the middle man
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024443_0024853 and then be like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024853_0025092 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0025508_0025538 i will see you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0026675_0027547 i will look at it when my usual working hours are from twelve oclock to three oclock or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0027547_0029410 i know you are always online you always make me feel bad when i go to bed they are like one you are still online you never go to bed just leave your computer on maybe yeah you pretend always busy so maybe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029410_0029595 but i am never online in the morning
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029595_0030227 you notice that no one is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0030764_0031418 yeah do what you want to do with it that was okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0031418_0031794 was there anything else we wanted to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033101_0033591 probably want to think about if we want to change goals and stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033591_0034574 i think one thing that we could probably skip totally is removing things from the audio files
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0034821_0035259 i am not gonna attempt that no i think so i think so too
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0037281_0037580 yeah that is definitely one thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0041751_0041938 like you have to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0042617_0044950 more or less plus or minus three days yeah i have only got six days to do the topic segment you do not have any spnl psi must do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053678_0053740 oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053740_0054016 sion in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵr in siŵ
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0056905_0057415 should we i do not know we think might but are queens that we have together
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057415_0057650 actually some of those are part
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057650_0058070 i am sure you are hungry for it yeah but what about them
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058198_0058396 this one is easy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058396_0058593 well if we are skipping the audio
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058775_0059373 just keep it together on the paper
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059565_0059750 на этот случай
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059750_0059870 okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0060478_0060694 we could just make it up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064215_0064651 yeah my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064651_0065348 i do not know if we have said anything maybe i can add a few sentences to what i have done
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065842_0065968 this is good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065968_0066281 and also sometimes it is a bit of a motivating factor too
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066281_0066343 right down the street
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066765_0066801 the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067581_0067962 well i still like struggling with java stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067962_0068274 yeah but it is cool
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068274_0068805 i think i was wondering about that is i do not look that way so much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068805_0069665 but if you guys know how you could do that like from the extract words that you did
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0069665_0070203 like also in extract timestamps and something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074139_0074374 so now i can just put it in
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074504_0074606 from the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074844_0074902 what on the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0075883_0075962 i am going to go to bed
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0089209_0089625 no so it is just when we click
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0090755_0090862 them at the same time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0115911_0115974 what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0118646_0118718 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0121631_0121738 yeah that is true yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0123724_0123835 yeah only pretty
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0125288_0125530 okay that is not smart say something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0126896_0127147 we are not really well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127290_0127571 we are not gonna do much more than just look at the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127716_0128450 the room like the text for room differences because we are not gonna search it and we are not gonna like listen to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128644_0128816 i think we are not doing the audio thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128989_0129377 so i guess just displaying it is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0129377_0129503 yeah yeah yeah do not read
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0130870_0130929 because it says
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131677_0131891 it is probably the best thing to do as you said
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131891_0132149 i do not think it is going to take long to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0153855_0154032 well i mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0169683_0170405 maybe a sleep
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0170405_0170552 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0171979_0172091 i do not know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172091_0172338 yeah okay actually that is a good idea
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172761_0173069 together she will shine it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0173660_0174199 and correct the back
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174199_0174381 they were changing the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174381_0174703 i am back
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175396_0175540 okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175540_0175983 over it was like four hundred and ninety six
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175983_0176353 um yeah in about thirty more or less
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012414 come on timeline
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0013926_0014135 you see it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014135_0014222 all the best
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014265_0014294 i am not sure
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014437_0014850 i am not sure if we need the outline of the prototype
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014850_0015021 i mean what were we going to put into that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015441_0015688 yeah because that is better
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015688_0015753 the whole
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025379_0025658 yeah well i mean it is up to you if you want to keep going with that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025658_0025799 i am happy to do some as well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025799_0025919 i have lots of time tonight
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026045_0026664 rwyn mynd i chi
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026664_0026730 oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027533_0027852 i know you always do not learn
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027852_0028436 they always make me feel bad because when i go to bed at like one you are still online
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028436_0028592 he never goes back
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028865_0029045 i can not
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029045_0029133 always busy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029133_0029280 you are right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029280_0029409 so maybe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032386_0032508 oh that is more oh that is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032508_0032636 that is the original
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032636_0032810 oh this is the one that okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0034547_0034909 that is what i thought as well i mean are we actually gonna attempt that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035060_0035247 i think so i too
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035247_0035573 i think that is going to be we do not even know how to approach that at the moment
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036630_0036715 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036715_0036928 yeah yeah that is right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036928_0037935 so maybe i mean we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0037935_0038266 but put it under changes since the initial specification
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0038266_0038901 and say you know we did not hear that we decided the time is too short
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0039384_0039848 rwyn eich bod yn ymwneud âr mêl
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0040496_0041100 and i think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041252_0041505 or some of these a bit later yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041758_0041920 my developer is google
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041920_0042435 yeah it is so cool
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042609_0042719 yeah it is more or less
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042719_0042856 yeah it is really good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045213_0045428 and you can say yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045428_0046024 we are still aiming for the development to be completely unmatured
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0047485_0047593 to the mic
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048189_0048321 yeah that is right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048321_0048439 we do not really want to do it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048439_0048678 it is not going to be difficult
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048678_0049161 if at least have all the information pop up that is already in the metadata file
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049161_0049366 that is going to be really worked
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049366_0049523 so it is definitely going to be something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0050130_0050484 yeah they might turn out even thoughtless
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0052660_0052741 yeah sounds good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053015_0053059 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053774_0054353 we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0054353_0054961 that is what he hinted that we should also indicate who is responsible for what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0055764_0056002 where you could put you know yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0060677_0060763 so um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0061496_0061766 have you managed any further on the search thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0062920_0062973 i will be worried
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0063613_0063708 yeah yeah

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084213_0084627 at the moment is there a window that comes up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084627_0084835 what is that a second result of pain
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084835_0085080 or is that a you know it is gonna get larger
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0085080_0085345 i think what we sort of
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090405_0090683 tabs but then you can not
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090855_0091354 if i want to compare the result one topic result with one summary result
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091653_0091831 actually all the results
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091831_0092168 os ydych chin cael ymgyrch ar y cyfle hwn
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092292_0092417 so assembly in top
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092417_0092558 that is true
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093213_0093492 i mean we could order them by meeting for example
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093846_0093986 reorder by
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093986_0094497 yeah well i mean that is the second step the first question is do we want to order
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0094497_0094659 how do we want to order them in the first place
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0095725_0095842 yeah maybe we should do that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098204_0098433 yeah why do not you just um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098544_0098638 colocode those
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098797_0099022 the results too
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101350_0101436 i do not know about a few
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101561_0101936 if you do it straight from you know you get the result

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0102270_0102935 rock bottom level thing if you found a segment then colour it print it in red or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103083_0103179 as opposed to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103884_0103924 my

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105878_0106013 oh oh i see ya
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106358_0106545 it was actually before
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106955_0107583 yeah i mean at the moment it works it works with highlighting in the transcript window does not it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0109010_0109145 what do you mean you need to work with him
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0110572_0111480 yeah i mean the whole what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pain made by night
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111480_0111676 felly dwin bwysig bod ynan dda
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111951_0112094 i am sorry

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115547_0115719 knight object model
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122144_0122353 why do we want to in xml though
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122353_0122857 rwyn credu ein bod nin gweithion ddweud y xml y gallwn ni
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123113_0123303 so as opposed to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123577_0123610 yes

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124313_0124485 at the moment it prints out all of them
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124485_0124910 rwyn gweithion ddod yn y fflwb yn ywr hyn syn mynd ir ddwyloedd
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124910_0125118 not store it at all whatsoever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0125724_0125789 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129048_0129102 so i guess
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129404_0129617 yeah yeah you do not really need to do much more with it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129617_0129694 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0131930_0132233 i do not think it is going to take long to produce anyway
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0132233_0133122 maen dda iawn maer cyfle hwnnwn dda iawn maen dda iawn i ddoddwyd yr holl ymlaen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0134416_0135016 you can nearly do it together with the original transcription having them run parallel
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135186_0135590 so if certain you know if it is a proper word
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135590_0136024 print it on both both panes and if it is not proper word then print only on one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136024_0136232 ond roedd yna ffantais
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136493_0136570 yay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137075_0137136 so then
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137251_0138184 you know the good way of doing it not together is that if someone does not want to look at the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138184_0138407 you know the chop file and you do not ever have to produce it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138548_0138826 but i mean you can you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138826_0139583 you can write we can write something like we will try and do it on the fly and and observe if that is gonna it is gonna take too long
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0139583_0140140 os byddain mynd iw ddod yn ymlaen fyddai am ymwneud âi ddod i ffil
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0140299_0140382 we are gonna go to the last exit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0141684_0141738 alright
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0151881_0152103 that is what programming is all about i am afraid
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153323_0153432 it is the higher people
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153895_0153967 well i mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154087_0154810 yeah why do not you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say you will have a look at both or something

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0162278_0162642 lose a bit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164106_0164193 something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164255_0164357 no maybe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164930_0165079 continuity

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0170046_0171229 so we are all still writing our summaries sending them to you you sent it on
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0171534_0171616 how kind
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0173065_0173652 and then send it on twitter so that we can nod

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0013743_0013850 oké ja
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0013850_0013946 i see that is fun
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0016742_0017526 yeah we can find something this could be just some just describe some screenshots
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018361_0018535 yeah you can either have it or we can just ignore that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018535_0018610 oh yes
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019159_0019391 you can hear that yeah it is a screenshot and stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019391_0020010 you could have screenshots by the thing each one or have just a bunch of them in one section
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020010_0020078 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020992_0021379 i have written the topic segmentation
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022275_0022355 성
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022355_0022375 it is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022984_0023725 i think that is what that should do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023859_0023970 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023970_0024180 i am not even gonna tell you to get a good role anyways
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0024180_0024754 i love being like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0026408_0026889 you can do the final one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0028261_0028966 i just leave your computer alone maybe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0031135_0031257 ça va te serager
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0035738_0036107 it is a good thing to have to say what we could have done if we had more time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036107_0036226 good for you to work is not it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036226_0036472 i think in conclusion we will find the report
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036472_0036842 should have we had more yeah yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0037097_0037360 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038504_0038624 we decided that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038837_0039136 oh we felt there were more important things to do at our time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0039295_0039468 and worried about
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041533_0041627 yeah that is good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041627_0041784 i should have a section
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042375_0042600 best far on target
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042801_0043608 that is true plus or minus three days yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0044105_0044380 ond dwin cael six dydd i wneud y segmentau atiadau
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0045439_0045574 we are still aiming
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046016_0046324 it is supposed to be done already oh really
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046324_0046575 yeah two days ago
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047298_0047592 give me a wee gun i will tell you the answer
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047900_0048145 maybe the speaker characterisation may get slimmer
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0048322_0048580 i really want to do it we will not disappear now
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049534_0049781 yeah we might make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049921_0050095 but we might not you never know in my time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050095_0050312 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050861_0051348 the topic segmentation with lcseg and textiles is basically done
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051348_0051744 it just needs to be tuned yeah tuned yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051744_0052069 search the parameters but it is made
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0052069_0052298 and see what happens
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0055240_0055341 you hear pretty much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0065809_0065877 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0066825_0067239 beth am y data sydd ar y gysylltiad
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067239_0067390 too bad he fell
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067390_0067474 that is not coming at all
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0068144_0068204 come on
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070071_0070141 easy yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070141_0071209 when he pulls up the segments part of that one of the attributes if you do get attributes call them with the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071209_0071456 attributes it returns a list of attributes
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071456_0071927 maen dweud beth y maen cael atribeidau
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071927_0072435 a gallwch ei wneud yn ymddygiad neu gallwch chi ddod yn ffyrdd a dweud dyma dydw in mynd ir tîm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0072435_0073145 so you just say get attribute input i think the method is called get attribute it is called start time and end time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073145_0073437 okay and that will tell you the start times and end times okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073437_0073534 i think it was at the double
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074447_0074908 maen ymwneud âr elementau non leol
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074908_0075230 maer obiect yn unrhyw ffordd iawn
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0075640_0075774 i should tell everybody
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088240_0088442 what have you confused me
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088442_0088847 do you have three separate windows with three separate different types of windows
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089021_0089334 oherwydd nid yn ddiforol
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089480_0089529 night
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0090204_0090299 or ten out of twenty
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0091839_0091961 yeah great friends
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0113936_0114207 it is got a night text playing or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114207_0114225 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114691_0114955 texting area yeah is not that right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115139_0115208 stay safe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115208_0115321 my second is called no
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115533_0115991 night object model
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115991_0116432 knight object model
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0117869_0117982 with the um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118130_0118569 removing the disabilities have you done anything with that yet
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118766_0119675 because i was wondering how we are going to write it back to html i mean xml if we did the processing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0119829_0119979 writing it back talking some more
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120575_0120691 it is a blood of text
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120820_0120872 thanks for watching
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121398_0121828 maen bwysig iawn i chi ei wneud os ywn nine x or ymlaen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121828_0122215 there is some bizarre method that puts things back into x and y forms
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0123311_0123783 oh select what we want just take bits of the xml only take certain segments
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124458_0124617 rydyn nin mynd ir flwyddyn
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124617_0124713 maen dda
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124713_0124801 sensing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124801_0124917 like that yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125458_0125580 says something different there
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125580_0125640 danke schön
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125789_0125942 then written to written to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125942_0126120 this makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126120_0126533 maen mynd i fod yn gallu gwneud pethau ar y ddwylo
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126533_0126623 so yeah that is fine
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129316_0129464 this is what i was talking about
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129659_0129757 i think it is like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130301_0130473 would just be a blurb of a summary
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130473_0130975 it will not look like it will not say speaker x says this speaker y says that speaker z says this
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131287_0131598 they all look ugly probably because it all looks just black and white
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131598_0131725 unless you want to start a fire
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0132163_0132382 it is just another
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133236_0133358 it does it on the fly anyway
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133510_0133859 so then it just goes through and says that this word equals that imprint
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0134183_0134337 maen bwysig iawn iw gweithio
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136501_0136598 yeah that will be good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136598_0136789 that is probably not as difficult
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136789_0136955 we just think fattened the code out a bit
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136955_0137127 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0138300_0138507 you do not ever have to produce it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140016_0140051 should i
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140051_0140536 they are just be if statements are not they
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140536_0140696 i was just thinking about that one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0141246_0141295 that is it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0143934_0144261 although on the fly it is typically pretty
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144261_0144569 even trying to read it in xml which i have always complicated enough
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144569_0145137 i gave up doing that finally i devalted back to night stuff because it was much much easier
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145283_0145518 so we can do it with night stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145518_0145969 maen dda iawn iw ddiddordeb ond roedd hynnyn ddiddordeb
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146180_0146289 i can not believe it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146289_0147004 you have to start defining object models like the knight thing in the game all bizarre weird things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0147004_0147093 so yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0157867_0157939 asbet or wyth
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0158908_0159085 ie maen dda maen dda maen dda
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159237_0159400 it is just a four loop really
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159400_0159494 it is really funny
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0160891_0161131 rwyn meddwl bod ymwneud ymlaen yn y sefydliadau fy hun
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0161282_0162274 i just said i said what i have done so far and what i am going to do yeah well maybe and some issues i will work into each
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162274_0162383 no sé si te explicas
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162560_0162760 lose a bit of continuity if you do that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162760_0162852 eu sou assim aqui
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162852_0163194 sometimes it is easier to have the top in the same instructions
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163194_0163417 so you talk about speaking characters and see where you come in
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163985_0164101 gold or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164101_0164355 bullet points
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164381_0164747 because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164747_0165061 if they are not together you lose a lot of continuity
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0165202_0165243 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0168522_0168675 see you soon
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172742_0172828 used to get together
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172828_0172899 she will show in it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0176443_0176700 oh mein gott
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178273_0178394 i hope that is alright yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178394_0178659 what is with all the ideas
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003903_0003990 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003990_0004240 i like the concept of this one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004240_0004381 i will take note system
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004495_0004612 cheers
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004745_0005954 actually i guess the first thing i just sort of did was sort of a brief version of what we have to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0005954_0006231 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012470_0012730 actually for that i was just copying the one straight out of the other documents
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012730_0013102 so it is all whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0013772_0013822 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014111_0014174 oh she is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014174_0014244 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015004_0015184 well just sort of well the thing is yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015184_0015707 we are going to be touching on all that during the other part
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015707_0015897 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015897_0016426 well it is just something that he had mentioned in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype to the other
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016426_0016728 unless we are just saying that we could potentially do that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016728_0016792 bien à vous
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016792_0016898 i think he saw something there
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017730_0017785 yeah sure
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017785_0018043 like the thing is i was thinking even in the stuff that i was doing i mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018043_0018395 just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you are doing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018395_0018519 can either of us we can just ignore that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018519_0018560 i am going to go ahead and
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018560_0018829 oh yes actually i had that at the very end screenshot
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018829_0018936 put that in chop on this page
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018936_0019111 i do not know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020934 anyways so yeah this is just very general structure i guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs here yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021133_0021163 all right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021313_0021454 i am not
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021454_0021977 so i know if there is other stuff that you think should be done to this i could do that before i am able to you guys
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021977_0022293 otherwise no
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0022293_0022953 so does someone else wanna throw it together actually i can probably still throw it together if you want i will put your parts into this one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023125_0023329 yes
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023630_0023745 that is a good idea
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023745_0024214 let us just cut out the middle yeah exactly i am not even going to tell it to you guys anyway
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0024214_0024440 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0027526_0027739 i know you are always online
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028668_0028943 just leave your computer alone
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028943_0029179 he pretend always busy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0029731_0030110 notice that noise
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030110_0030238 oui
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030488_0030619 so i will send it out to you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030619_0030654 enough
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031329_0031464 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031677_0031881 was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031881_0032249 i mean essentially was what you can see in a doctor
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032249_0032460 well frisky over oh there is more
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032460_0032772 well that is the original oh this is the one that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032772_0033027 yeah yeah it was just copied straight out
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0036788_0037258 unless we discover some sort of time warp thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0038142_0038232 investigation
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041160_0041286 this this one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041286_0041566 or some of these a bit later or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041566_0041631 wirklich wir
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042654_0042791 more or less
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042881_0042968 through
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042968_0043351 plus or minus three days
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043351_0043505 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043505_0043786 that was true
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044331_0044624 キエシス
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044624_0045064 you do not have any spl psi on this do you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046238_0046442 yeah two days ago
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046442_0046502 what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046502_0047118 for one of those something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0047576_0047898 like should we put a hint that something like that might happen into the document
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0048484_0048561 it is not
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049218_0049277 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049277_0049343 that is right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049542_0049639 okay that make you disappear
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0051551_0051685 tuned the cut yeah tuned
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0054984_0055312 i could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well yeah pretty much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055312_0055519 that is essentially the same as it was
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055519_0055766 more detail specifically
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057504_0057594 click those apart
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057638_0057891 it looks like i like that i am very fond of it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057891_0058016 yeah but what about
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0058470_0058757 what if we are skipping the audio one and then it is not easier
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059159_0059383 have you taken this work from the count
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059383_0059545 have you taken any more of a look at it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059545_0059671 other displays okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059852_0059926 you could probably
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060166_0060504 i know full time to look at that before tomorrow yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060504_0060724 we could just make it up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060724_0061147 like i will claim one you claim the other for the search things and then we can leave that one as a joint one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061295_0061394 i am gonna be good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061780_0062365 um i found finally today something that i can build it in and i should have something for tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0062365_0063158 i should at least very least have a gui a venda wire i will be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063158_0063436 i want to get something i want to see this i want to get it together
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063436_0063952 i have an image in my mind and i just want to see it on the thing and then get my screenshot
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065078_0065557 i mean you can write the sentences first as well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065557_0065912 i mean with the intention that this is done
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065912_0066273 and also sometimes it is a bit of a motivating factor too
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066273_0066537 i write down the words and the ideas
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066537_0066801 i think you want to do this something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0067941_0067973 time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077159_0077621 something that um there is but i have not made a lot of changes to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077621_0077969 so i might just delete what i have done and copy it in from yours
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077969_0078306 because i am sure you have probably made some changes already
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078306_0078362 mm hmm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078362_0078473 since friday night
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078539_0078676 i thought you said okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078676_0078817 alright i see
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078856_0079508 i thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have cost some bugs and that you were coming up with pixels on the weekend or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079508_0079598 no
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0079847 okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079969_0080142 thank you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080142_0080966 yeah so if you are all other stuff out there that actually i am gonna try and minimize the amount of changes i make to ambroser anyways
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080966_0081036 شكراً لك
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081165_0081248 чего ты пенишь
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081248_0081582 actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081582_0082029 like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082114_0082502 do we want separate result pains for each of those
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082502_0083092 or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083092_0083471 so that when they click on that it is gonna go to the relevant thing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083471_0083998 like just if they check all three say topics summary blah blah blah have three different windows come up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0084148_0084359 or three like so
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085039_0085733 what i thought what we sort of discussed last week was to have it sort of on the same window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085733_0086046 so it will be on the search window bottom half of the search window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086046_0086485 i do not know if he is still one key that way but that is so that is what i was gonna be working
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086485_0086802 so it is just like you click those and just load up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086802_0087255 yeah splits that thing into two or three or whatever it is one two three depending on which one
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087255_0087384 ones you check
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087384_0087866 so if we want to do it that way you know like it probably does not matter too much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087866_0088246 just trying to think if there is going to be any other issues down the road
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0088813_0089409 no just pains just result pains okay not three different pains no no no
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089409_0089503 cest bon
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089503_0089859 so it is just when we click topics and summaries for what we want to search
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089859_0090212 there will be two result pains
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090212_0090467 i do not know really tabs
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090467_0090932 but then you can not see all of them at the same time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0091303_0091783 well it is no but the thing is if you are looking if you could check them both you will see all the results
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092178_0092282 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092314_0093320 so the summary and the topic and the transcripts that is true or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0093620_0094088 oh yeah i guess that was the other thing whether we want to have this reorder by yeah well i mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094088_0094233 that is what that is like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094233_0094296 second
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094729_0094978 i think yeah probably by meeting makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094978_0095288 i mean essentially they are in time order
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095288_0095598 so that kind of makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095767_0095835 you should do that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096204_0096458 should be an easy one no i do not know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096458_0096585 should be for a few seconds
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0098888_0099364 i think sometimes in a case like that like i have run across some in other languages
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099364_0099946 it is hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it is put into a list box or something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099946_0100175 it is hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100175_0100452 and then if we are highlighting something in the transcript window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100452_0101260 it may be difficult to get that information back once it is just in a list box an item in a list box
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101260_0101496 so i know that if you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101496_0101599 where is it was coming from
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103036_0103108 as a
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103329_0103842 um yeah it is just like from past experience of there is goofy little things that happen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103842_0104599 and just does not let you say certain things and just kind of trying to do a different kind of to go to a different window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0104599_0105080 so if you want to go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105080_0105308 at that point that is where it starts getting a little bit tricky
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105308_0105835 because you are working with an event handler within the one panel or a loose box or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105835_0105890 да
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106024_0106677 there are ways around it but whether people will figure something out before tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106677_0106952 or delegates or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106952_0107083 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107588_0107656 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107851_0108601 i think he was saying that as long as we implement that interface it should work with anything that we do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108601_0108763 like highlighting you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108763_0109120 i think that was a sign what do you mean it should work with the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109120_0109343 um is not jonathan saying something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109343_0109760 i think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109760_0110058 we should be able to have that highlighting happen
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110058_0110116 mm hmm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110116_0110158 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0113476_0113968 i think i really should use that as well
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115367_0115504 why it is not many men
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115704_0115871 i am on the couch i am excited
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0119968_0120335 i thought we were just going to have that as words
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0120335_0121016 like not as xml just sort of as a what was that text file well transcript
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121016_0121339 no because then we need all the other data from the transcript
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121635_0121783 yeah that is true yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121783_0121815 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125252_0125286 i
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125286_0125531 okay that is not smart say something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125531_0125664 yeah thanks a lot
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125664_0125902 dynar ffordd y gallwn ddod
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125902_0126033 actually but this makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0126624_0126989 yeah if we are going to do the xml then fine
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129344_0129433 i am gonna start
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129704_0130120 but i think it is like well how would we display the like if we do take this fluency zone and just you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130120_0130471 creative text file
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130967_0131486 unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0131568_0131631 that is flippy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140401_0140531 oops
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140531_0141101 i was just thinking about it and it is probably been used like xslt to kind of just transform it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141101_0141775 flip it into just transforms like a style sheet
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141775_0142195 and then it is kind of like there is usually things built into well it should be built into john williams
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142195_0142837 process excel and i can just create whatever file it is going to be in
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142837_0143107 it is been a couple years since i have looked at anything like this
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143107_0143373 that might even be easier
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143373_0143725 and then that way we could even pre process that beforehand
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143725_0143963 i do not know we do not want to have to do that right
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143963_0144215 although unapplied it is typically pretty
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144532_0144657 i gave up too and then
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144657_0144731 anyway
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0145444_0145524 yeah okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146551_0146596 but they
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146596_0146733 in the game
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146895_0146946 and soon
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147168_0147522 i was thinking i might try and talk to who was it jonathan or gene
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147522_0147857 just to see what system they used to develop this stuff
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147857_0148685 because it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just to actually use the system
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148685_0148921 you know at a higher level rather than kind of you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148921_0149202 playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149202_0149408 and be nice and just sort of see what they are doing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149408_0149827 so i am going to try and contact them see if there is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149964_0150225 oder hinsichtlich von uns
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150225_0150542 just to get things moving at a higher level i guess
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150688_0151137 seems to be more interesting to use it as a real developer would
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151304_0151743 could just seem like a little tinkering here and there just adding a couple things
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151889_0151929 that is more
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152034_0152305 no no it should not be
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152305_0152397 i think she would be higher alone
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152397_0153316 that should be conceptual and coming up with brilliant ideas and then just bring those to reality
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0153441_0153811 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0155864_0156372 like the thing that i was thinking there as well is once it is done for one meeting it is done
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156372_0156430 it is fine
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156430_0156582 text file or xml or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156582_0157089 it does not make any difference really either way
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157089_0157402 it is like if it is fast enough on the fly then sure
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157402_0157749 that is about the only issue i have with on the fly whether it is fast enough
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157956_0158182 especially with java and stuff like that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0158182_0158649 if it is loading the file and processing it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0159496_0159838 with a run to the memory
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161181_0161213 네
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161805_0161922 you can flip it up
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0162054_0162383 i can not reach
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163146_0163210 yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163372_0163537 that does make sense
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163537_0164018 but maybe at the end maybe just a point form of things that we are still working on
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164018_0164192 oherwydd
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164712_0164801 yeah

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0173283_0173628 i am not gonna do that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0174290_0174848 they were changing dialogue back
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0175479_0175581 i am not sure how that over it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176364_0176543 oh oh my gosh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176882_0177179 that is right

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012507_0012860 i think there is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012860_0014128 and just because the topic box and all this is based on what was it called non night text area or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014128_0014333 and takes the risk always
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014333_0014626 and it has some sort of highlighting stuff there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014626_0014856 so you should probably look at the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0015536_0015731 i am not sure if it is inbuilt though to be honest
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0016668_0016786 right

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062708_0063054 so have you done these yet no no i have already done them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063054_0063276 just gotta decide on what we want to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063527_0063800 i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063948_0064594 so it is all usable now can i do it tonight no design a game first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0066667_0066722 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067308_0067648 well let me know when it is sort of usable
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067648_0067710 if you can if you want to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068138_0068232 what do you mean a picture
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068232_0068607 just the yeah but it is not going to take very long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068607_0068783 i mean yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070272_0070386 sounds good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070386_0070452 felly a yw hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070452_0070695 mae hynnyn ystod y
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070898_0071135 on your home actually not in there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0071468_0071520 actually i can not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0072563_0073206 are you wanting to write that indirectly or what do you want to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073206_0073320 if you want to change my code
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073552_0074028 do you want to change the original embraer the file in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074028_0074121 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074288_0074356 have you done that now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074568_0074831 oh okay so not the actual one but a copy of it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075146_0075269 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075269_0075311 물론
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075690_0075818 well just tell me when
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075818_0076625 because i usually work on my own copy for the day and then update it without checking if the one in the show has changed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0076625_0076783 maen rhaid i mi ddod iw gwneud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0077208_0077283 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0078579_0078992 so it is not what you are working on now then to represent the results
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0079726_0079893 i mean the highlighting stuff
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0081352_0082292 actually for any text area whatever it is they define some handy highlights on that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082292_0082443 so you have got different highlights
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082443_0082847 felly rydym nin cael felly roedden nhwn cael ei ddweud amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano amdano
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082847_0083407 we have got like user highlights selection highlights time highlights
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083564_0083648 so now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083866_0084550 so you can quite easily if your text area is called area you just do area dot set highlights or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084550_0084615 是
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084903_0085417 dynar ffordd y byddaf in ei wneud i gysylltu i gysylltu dros ymhellach mewn amser a transgrifau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0085647_0085685 that is good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091133_0091466 but if you do not know it is more like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091466_0092196 i am like oh yeah i have got all this space between me and you and then i go oh no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092196_0092783 is it talking now it is talking so nice machine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092912_0093190 i spent too much time on it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093287_0093764 alright well i have been doing some random pop up windows for the speaker characterisation which is good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093764_0093949 so fill that in now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093949_0094239 the windows are all there now after lots of filling
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094447_0094830 wel yw ond pob or nid pob or maen ddiffforddiol ia
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094830_0095852 because it basically has to set up like ten pop up windows in memory as in already initialize them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0095852_0097625 because there might be ten speakers now all have to have different windows and working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the of the topics of the meetings that topic was mentioned in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0097625_0098398 and i have a question about the said we wanted a start screen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098398_0098686 what kind of starts randy what do you want
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098686_0099910 i mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser or something more like an sd browser some speech and some music
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0099910_0100194 it does not take too long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0101016_0101819 so do we want yeah maybe we could write on like that whatever it is called the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0102824_0103036 yeah how
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103036_0103596 yn y cyfle yma maen un pwmpen diwylliannol fel y gwelwch chin gweld
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103596_0104380 with all the and that because it is the dialogue class that you use there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105197_0105814 i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105814_0106146 and through that once you have got the results you click on something else stupid nft
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106641_0106681 does it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106846_0106986 the only thing you can search is a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0109093_0109356 can you not get this non object
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0110808_0111239 i suppose we would not want to use yeah we would not want to use xt at the beginning anyway
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111239_0111597 because we do not want to search locally
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111597_0111799 so honestly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112036_0112390 then they would open the meeting first right yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112390_0113079 so let us say they have two options either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0114980_0115106 maybe why do we want default
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0115106_0115222 just one more
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117710_0117866 yeah but local search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117866_0118149 we can not do levels though right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118149_0118201 on three
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118903_0119072 so we are getting any useful
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0119572_0120392 but yeah the global inverted false edge gives the non objects basically to the local search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0120772_0120979 well yeah that is always going to be the case with search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0127554_0128257 i mean you can you know the option is to do a search in the way that if you do a global search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128257_0128525 and the first step only return the meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128525_0129236 as in not even meetings but the name of the meeting so you know say you want to search for the word language
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129236_0129671 then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129671_0130137 and then you can decide well i want to search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0131846_0131917 so yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0133484_0134502 there is in one of the papers they have names
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0134502_0135159 even better understanding
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135159_0135296 that is a working group
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135328_0135540 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136130_0136376 so i have put that in already too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136513_0136562 let us go
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136797_0137361 so yeah again concretely to the startup startup whatever it is window
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0138687_0138799 what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139654_0139748 yeah how is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139748_0140090 i mean do you think you would have time for that as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0143830_0144030 it would have been like a list of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0146883_0147426 so the general score would that be for the whole of the language
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0147621_0147931 i am gonna go with chomp
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148152_0148272 like that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148571_0149086 felly beth oedd y gilyddaur ffaith yma beth oedd yn edrych
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149086_0149296 ychwanegol
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149296_0149507 just a list of keywords or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0150892_0151721 because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151721_0151946 because if you just have the segmentation that is great
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151946_0152612 ond dweudwn ni ddim yn gallu cydweithior gweithiau ir gweithiau anotatior gweithiau segmentio
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154848_0154929 yeah that was fun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154929_0155000 for me very nice
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0157347_0157497 yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158504_0158755 yeah that is what i am thinking too do we need to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158755_0158866 just looked at
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158866_0158946 what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159488_0159909 sort of but then the main idea was more like to speed up speed the search up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159909_0160355 i guess nxt over the whole of the covers would just not feel
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160355_0160440 that way it is slowed down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160737_0161085 no but the general inverted file
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161085_0161177 it is still uses a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161177_0161402 yeah it ranks the results by the amount
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161402_0161533 that would just be nice extra
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161826_0162209 yeah i was not sure i do not think we have that in the document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162322_0162464 you too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162464_0162631 so what it is only interim
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163367_0163566 yeah i mean if you have time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163566_0163798 i am only going to do this if i have got time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163798_0164155 oherwydd roedd en rhoi i chi os ydych chin gweithio ar gyfer gweithiau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164155_0164659 it will give you the the meetings but also how often that word occurred in that meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164659_0164887 we just give you a rank
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164944_0164998 oh
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0165287_0165337 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166254_0166691 yeah but it would be useful how informative that tfidf is an informative score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166691_0167133 if you search for language and you return like you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0167133_0167654 basically all of the meetings you want to see where they actually spoke about it where they are just mentioning it once
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169068_0169150 language and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169607_0169964 i am sorry i am sorry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171103_0171347 いやいや
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171347_0171413 because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171413_0171547 the things that you can not do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0184287_0185068 so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185068_0185739 i mean for the part where you can choose the meeting what kind of information do you want to have about the meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185739_0186339 i mean the longer name obviously if there is one because they do not all have longer names
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186339_0186624 what the users that spoke
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186624_0186781 uses that took part
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186781_0187146 then that is pretty much the same for the same group
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187463_0187523 i said
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187875_0188443 yeah just to give them an idea a general idea of what there is so they can pick a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190217_0190360 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190360_0191168 rwyn mynd i weld y cyfle y maen ddod or grwp o ffyrdd cymdeithasol
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191168_0191313 yn y cyfle hwnnw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191313_0191358 못 보다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193761_0193944 keep it more general
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193944_0194339 because we just want to have a way of you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0194339_0195069 because as soon as they have got loaded their first meeting they can browse through that quite nicely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0196708_0196761 what do you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197378_0197509 how are we going to know that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197755_0197983 it can happen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198418_0198689 but that would defy the whole point of browsing right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198689_0198979 if you only want to look at the top alright call it favorites then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198979_0199684 yeah you can have a favourite now just scroll down the list and find your favourite one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0199684_0200295 yeah it is not enough information it is not like they come back every day and do the same thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0200295_0200898 айфу ка
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0201511_0201565 like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0203619_0203867 so we can not yeah oh right sorry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0204433_0204785 no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205023_0205757 i was not going to put any help in there any sort of explanation of how the browser works to be honest
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205757_0205864 dobrým sočkím
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207091_0207139 sim
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207616_0207937 but i mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208152_0208271 yeah we will switch
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208271_0208431 even if it just said two things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0209821_0210117 yeah that all happens through the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210117_0210615 basically either the user knows which meeting you want to look at and you just click on it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210615_0211023 or he does not and then he searches for one that sort of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213265_0213415 oh i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213415_0213551 inside the segment yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0215327_0215467 ie dynar bwrdd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216096_0216266 ie maen rhaid i ni
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216266_0216811 ond dwin anodd beth ywr holl wybodaeth yma
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216811_0217577 we want all the information about the name the language the user
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217577_0217646 well we do not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217863_0218569 maybe if they know the codes and in other in other courses in case like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0219105_0219240 in droir ddod or gwrs
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220084_0220230 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220271_0220456 but then yeah as i said
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0221530_0222119 no no no i am not saying you can pick a user but it should come up with some list
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222119_0222777 but an extended list of the meetings so you know you have a bdr whatever it was called very long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222777_0223344 and then it gives you the longer name blah and then it gives you the you know the participants
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223637_0223889 i do not think so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223959_0224134 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224134_0224316 but then is that complicated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224316_0224556 no it is not at all i think it is cool too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224556_0224692 i told it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224692_0224950 i have not tried that yet but i was going to do it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224950_0225317 i am actually in this now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225317_0225963 yeah i am not sure but is that annoying is that not annoying if you have to get out of the bloody way i am trying
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225963_0226273 i am sorry i just laughed at that bit
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226273_0226386 we do that a lot do not we
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226386_0226994 i ddysgu am unrhyw ddwylo mae angen i chi gysylltur ddwylo
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226994_0227437 wait for it to pop up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0229882_0230290 it would just be nice to have some basic information on
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230290_0230807 yeah thinking about that it updates yeah as you go over it then that does not get any worse like in the wet
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230807_0230954 yeah maybe that is the best idea then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230954_0231487 so you have got a drop down menu a search button not search go button
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0231713_0231788 and then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232000_0232366 some sort of fields which updates dynamically depending on what you have highlighted
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232710_0232798 yeah that sounds good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0233635_0233667 see
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234346_0234496 what does non nice yourself think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234696_0234930 i am not ou yet
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235811_0235971 right right actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235971_0236358 you have got lots of non something and then night something and then end something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0236758_0236869 one is an interface and one is a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238062_0238529 and most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you have got to update this jonathan
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238529_0238836 this is unintelligent
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238898_0239158 great
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0240763_0241021 yeah yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241021_0241212 it is not great though
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241212_0241619 right so anyone else got anything to say

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244842_0244907 if you like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244907_0245123 we can discuss that friday if you have it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0245675_0245756 what fun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0247755_0248019 i have got a doctor is appointment at ten to two
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0250419_0250544 수이사
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251067_0251106 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251571_0252344 maer un yn dda i chi yw hynny nid nid nid hynnyn cael ein bod yn dda i ni fel thirty five munud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252344_0252592 what what it is not that much it is a bit more than that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252592_0252753 like you know five or six
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0253117_0253282 it is three oclock let us go
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0254517_0254873 i will write this meeting up and i will send it to them as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0255359_0256031 because she is not here no i mean she collected oh right oh yeah sorry yeah that is cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256031_0256612 i thought somebody was collecting them but that is what i thought we needed to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256612_0256834 i know we should probably do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257021_0257501 so can we just repeat briefly what i was talking about
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257501_0258117 so we have done progress on the speaker characterisation who does the speaker characterisation
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258117_0258709 we mentioned topic labeling with keywords
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258709_0259136 maen bwysig y bydd y gysylltiad yn ei wneud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0259136_0259489 and michael do you have anything
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260473_0260541 do we just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260848_0261428 well basically not unless you have got time for it at the end
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0261428_0261548 nice at the end
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263546_0263744 i think it would also
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263885_0264236 i think it would give you the most relevant result
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0265828_0266434 no but for things like if you search for language then you might have you have some topics which have as a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0266434_0267224 some meetings which have as a topic language they specifically speak about language and they use that word like in every sentence
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267224_0267660 and then you have got those that just mention it briefly like once or twice saying
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267660_0268069 you know my language is german or something stupid but you do not really want
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268069_0268282 so you want to distinguish those somehow
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268282_0268379 or nice anyway
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268695_0268792 very easy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269326_0269623 i think it is all terms we can just do something pretty simple
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269623_0269691 i mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272028_0272402 yeah just yeah so then just next just as we go yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272402_0272761 yeah i mean you just do it really simply you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272761_0273228 we will have to talk to brunella about this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0273228_0273333 we are using that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274023_0274217 it does not have to be all intelligent
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274503_0274584 and if the one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281142_0281256 we will see you next time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281256_0281671 yeah but there are seventy five meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283154_0283256 yeah it is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283612_0284081 it would be useful as well for a word like the language that might occur in all of them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284081_0284542 but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284934_0285207 maen bwysig i chi ddysgu am ddysgu llyfr y dynion
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285410_0285498 and so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285850_0286022 we will discuss it again on friday
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0002306_0002541 does it squeeze in like that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0005698_0005937 ik ga in de
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0009179_0009353 did i just say the same thing as you just said to his
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0010398_0010516 felly sut ydym yn mynd ir holl
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017338_0017486 i want to do a bit of that shit
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017486_0018262 the data processing is fine but i do not particularly want to do the gui for it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018262_0018397 no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018397_0019186 if you want to do that then tell me how you want the data presented
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019186_0019778 i have created two classes one that represents speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019778_0020295 syn cymryd âr cyfleoedd ac maer wybodaeth am ddod or ddod yn ymddangos yn ymddangos yn y gwaith
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020295_0020877 maen mynd ir obiectau ar obiectau yn ymddygiad âr wybodaeth am y cyfle ar cyfle
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020877_0021528 felly y gyrfa sydd yn y gyrfa au ddod yn ymwneud âu ddod a ynar adnoddau sydd yn ymwneud âr gyrfa
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021528_0021812 so there is two separate classes do you see what i mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021812_0021965 and they are two different objects
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021965_0022709 maen gallu gweithior rhai or obiectau ac yna rydych chin caelr obiectau yn ôl ac maer obiectau sydd wedii adnabod yn caelr wybodaethau y maen nhwn angen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0022709_0023131 a gallwch chi ddod o fathau i roi beth sydd eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich e
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023131_0023532 neur hyn ond dyna beth syn dechrau a beth ywr ffordd ymddygiadau i gael y data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023891_0024199 yes basically all kind of things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024199_0024593 ac yn ogystal âr obiectau fellyobjfans
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024593_0025389 maen dweud y byddwch chin dweud y nod yng nghymdeithas ai dweud y peth yma gallwch ddweud y peth yma neur peth yma ar gweithdor
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025463_0025733 a hynnyn gweithion un or tîm i popur ddau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025733_0026149 ond dyna beth y byddwn in mynd iw ddweud beth y fformat y byddwch chi eisiau y datblygu yn ôl
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026149_0026783 because it can come back as almost anything
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026783_0026961 maen dda iawn iw ddysgu
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0028239_0028328 yeah it can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0029102_0030576 felly gallwn in ei gynnig i fod yn ei roi i chi oherwydd ymlaen ystafellau datblygiadaun bwysig ywr teimloedd ar y gweithredu syn dweud maen cael un syn dweud ymlaen yw ymlaen ymlaen ymlaen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030576_0030860 one percent cwch a one percent cyfrif
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030860_0030913 do you sell me
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030913_0031695 and then it is got inside it is got a link it is got a it is got the speaker is name and then it is got their percentage for that thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0031695_0032375 felly gallwch ddod yn ôl gallwch gael y hasid arall neu gallwch gael ei roi fel vectr ac maen dweud noes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032375_0032689 maen unrhyw strin ddŵr ex percent sign
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032689_0032977 we will say a vector that is cool i do not know whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032977_0033810 you can either have an embedded vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0033810_0034240 what the easiest thing to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0034640_0034795 yeah he is hit my way around
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0035962_0036317 see that is the key how did we look at that again
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0036622_0037082 of it is in that format it is speaker
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037082_0037710 maen ddwyloedd maen ddwyloedd yn y peth yng nghyngor
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037768_0038191 felly maer holl beth sydd wedii calioli hefyd yn ymwneud âr ddarlith
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038191_0038361 yeah that is easy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038361_0038476 so i am not quite amazing actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038476_0038941 the influences are i lived in germany for six months do not know if that had any effect
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038941_0039137 i just spent too much time talking to brits
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039137_0039381 nou het is een bezalte
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039381_0039876 i think we need to give a go
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039876_0040167 ac yna maer hyn a allan oedd yn cyrraeddol hefyd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040167_0040336 what we will have to do is get the dialogue out
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040336_0040428 that is a number that is good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041434_0041734 so then how is this box populated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041734_0041973 maen populiol or un gweithdor ar un hwyliadau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042237_0042339 the warm present
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042950_0043546 oherwydd ar y moment mae yna metodau iw ddweud y ffordd y maen ei ddefnyddio i ddwy or torth
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0043546_0044062 so i was pressing it and it says like get talk time and you take the name
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044062_0044474 so that that would call that and call the meetings method that is a return now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044474_0044823 a byddain popi fel hynny a byddain dda in dda
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044823_0045043 i mean that would
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046352_0046390 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046899_0047044 yeah yeah that would be easy as well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047199_0047239 yeah okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047239_0047777 felly roeddwn in mynd yn llawer o fathau syn dod yn unrhyw fath
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047777_0048030 maen bwysig iw wneud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048030_0048200 okay yeah that is fine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048700_0048948 get to all the time i think it is called
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049571_0049713 no there is still an object file
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049713_0050140 prices a whole lot of line and then they are much much smaller
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050140_0050561 only like a one without one k so that is all just pre processed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050561_0050671 yeah this will be consistent
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050671_0050993 ac yna maen gweithio ar y pethau sydd wedi cael ymddygiad
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050993_0051116 mae angen i chi gyrraedd y gyrraedd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051116_0051305 it is got a load method
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051305_0051769 felly yw gweithio yw gweithior gwaith yn nod or gwaith
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051769_0052052 ai gweithion dda i gyd yn ystod ei hunain
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052052_0052355 and then if you call it a nile constructor
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052355_0052804 yna gallwch chi ddod o load a gallwch chi ddod o load o un neur holl or un neur holl or un
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052804_0052879 das ist es
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053397_0053633 rwyn oed yn gyfle iw gweithio
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053683_0053812 hold that yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053812_0053941 أدأ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054355_0054561 it just tells you who participated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054561_0055144 yn y cyfle hwnnw ar amlydd y maent yn cymryd y cyfle hwnnw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055391_0055574 yeah yeah it will be pretty easy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055903_0056071 ja dat is het
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056071_0056435 maen bwysig ir broblem gydar unrhyw beth ddim wedii ddod or bwysig
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056752_0056795 дай мне храбрость
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056795_0057141 no which i have been specifying to be a half a default
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057141_0057373 there are some default nothings actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057373_0057710 maen rhaid i mi ddod oherwydd y byddwn yn ymwneud âr bwyd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0058924_0059029 yeah that would be a problem
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059029_0059346 a yna gallwch chi wneud ymddygiad ar y cyfle ar y gweithredu
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059346_0059579 because that is the thing these these are so small
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059579_0060210 gallain mynd ir holl arfer ai ddysgu ar yr holl arfer i ddysgu a ywr bobl yn gwneud rhywbeth yn ogystal âr blynyddoedd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0060210_0060321 felly nid ywn gysylltur peth
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061027_0061353 the global statistics come straight off of that do not they
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061353_0061562 because they are just for the meat
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061822_0062225 maer cyfleoedd ysbytain gwybod am y pethau hynny ar cyfleoedd ysbytain gwybod am hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0062858_0063016 נו נו ואתה יעבוד תהיה את זה
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063289_0063528 but we were not near
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063528_0063805 roeddwn in credu bod yna ddaeth oherwydd yn bwysig felly roeddwn in ei wneud ymlaen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064279_0064838 no design a good first because the problem is if you change the classes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064838_0065272 the object serial number is changed and you can not reload the object so all the rest of the thing has to be done over again
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065272_0065398 ac oeddwn i ddim yn ymwneud â hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065605_0065949 it would become out of sync and get a bit funny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065949_0066289 if i gave you one if i gave you it now and you worked on it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066289_0066787 and then i changed it and run the thing again you would never be able to like the old jazz myself
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066787_0067293 a yna bydd angen copir holl ffordd o obiectau neu beth syn cael ei gael maen ddiddordeb dwin credu
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0067637_0068265 but if you want to make a picture you can do that without anything what do you mean a picture
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068265_0068459 i mean just the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068459_0068569 yeah but it is not gonna take long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068569_0068860 is that does not take away yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069110_0069420 nid oes yn dda iawn i gael ei dda
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069420_0069766 but i will need to have done all this stuff to you first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069766_0069924 oherwydd y byddair obiect yn dda
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0070656_0070793 that is still my home direction
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071077_0071212 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071212_0071434 o es finista por el glanero
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089041_0089444 that way it does not crash you try and load all ten in one it crashes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089444_0090063 maen bwysig iawn os gallwch chin ffwrdd os gallwch chi gysylltu ten ffrindiaethau cyhoeddus yn ymgysylltu
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090063_0090305 you can do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090305_0090583 i can not do them i can not do them if it thinks they are one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090583_0091142 because it is about the amount that each you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091142_0091801 ond os ddyddech chi roeddwn yn dweud oes gen i gyd yn dda mae gen i gyd yn dda
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091801_0091884 guys
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091884_0092582 does it talk to you now does it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0092582_0093326 so nice and she thinks
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094276_0094351 no de todo de
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094351_0094424 yeah i think so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094645_0094693 they pop up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094693_0094753 it was difficult
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099083_0099438 it is an sd browser
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099438_0100082 some speech and some music
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0101925_0102381 or a switchboard that comes up that is just a blank form like that with some buttons on
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102381_0102717 lloed mi ymwneud lloed mi ymgyrch lloed mi rhywbeth unrhyw beth
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102717_0102797 whistle a tune
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0105945_0106173 stupid nft search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106173_0106536 maen angen i chi gael unrhyw ddwylo o hyd iw ddod yn ôl
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106774_0107296 the only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you have loaded an observation
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0107942_0108922 you could use the inverted file search to return a list of meetings and then use one of those to load a search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0108922_0109064 по любому
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109368_0109743 it has to be an observation and even if you go you can go and search the whole corpus from that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109743_0110080 ond maen rhaid i chi ddod o beth oherwydd rhywbeth
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110080_0110675 maen unrhyw metod ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymwneud âr ffyrdd ymw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110675_0110886 the engine class only has one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0111483_0111596 ie iawn cael ei wneud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118131_0118293 it does not take long to load up anyway
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118293_0118486 you can light the dumb one up it does not have any
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0120372_0120433 謝謝
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121092_0121255 it only gives one at a time anyway does not it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121255_0121388 because otherwise you crash the thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0124992_0125139 it is not too slow though i do not think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125139_0125328 it is not too bad is not it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125328_0125523 dwin meddwl bod hynnyn gallu ei wneud yn y ffordd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125936 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130214_0130271 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130271_0130817 maen gwneud ymlaen iw gwneud yn ymddygiadau fel y gallai ac yna ar y pethau yn ymwneud âr hyn a phan oedd yn anodd iw gweithio
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130817_0130921 and these are the motions
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132245_0132471 did we think about
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132681_0132824 ymlaen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134197_0134354 oh did they did they really translate it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134607_0134666 good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134666_0134793 okay let us wait
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134793_0134875 i am gonna just use that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135077_0135305 that is a working group is not it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135332_0135852 i wanna see the videos about baby i do not understand
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0136433_0136556 okay that is good that is good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138033_0138314 so who would have the ideas
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138314_0138521 i am in the ds
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138521_0138764 document frequencies for each word
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139058_0139344 yeah to do what tiske is talking about you do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139344_0139509 to do the topic later
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0140243_0140790 if somebody is done the keyway the idea of the dfs already with me not too probably
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143073_0143304 how do you do an inverted valsets without the tfid
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143503_0144032 i think you need to have that well it would have been like a list
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144032_0144273 the amount that they occur over ten documents
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144273_0145030 basically the amount the what is a sample df is the document frequency is the amount that each word occurs no what is it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0145030_0146188 maer amser oedd yn ymwneud yn un or amser syn cael ei wneud yn un document ar un oedd y amser syn cael ei wneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0146188_0146938 so the more it occurs in specific topic comments compared to its general score the more informative it is about a certain topic
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147303_0147608 the thing you call cross it cross it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147937_0148548 plus a stop list so you remove stuff that does not like that and then there which is going to have a probably basically equal score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148743_0148810 these fake tacos
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148964_0149212 bunch of keywords bunch
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149212_0149416 maen dda in ffyrdd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149416_0149507 keywords or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149507_0149838 what is the i in tfidf
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149838_0149964 inverse document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149964_0150187 ymlaen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0150429_0150823 i did do it once i do have a job class that does it for something i do not know whether it was
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0152722_0153001 also keywords give you an eye on a whole new type of set
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153001_0153109 i am gonna do a keyway session
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153109_0153454 ond gallair tebygau cyhoeddus oedd yn ymwneud âr hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153454_0154048 yn ystod hynny roeddwn yn gweithio ar ddwyloedd pan fyddain teimlo roeddwn yn cael cyfle ir ddwyloedd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0154203_0154315 felly diolch
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0155341_0156222 rwyn meddwl yn ogystal âr ffordd y maer ffordd ynan ei fod yn dda maen dda
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0156222_0157189 the easy bit is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole occurrences in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157189_0157624 because you do not have to integrate as much information
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157973_0158359 no you can do search without tfidf you just can not rank the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0158970_0159494 no no no but is not that what the idea was in the first place to rank the results so that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160264_0160488 yeah but that way it slowed down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160488_0160600 ranking once that down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161107_0161604 maen angen ir ffyrdd yn dda ond maen cymryd y ffyrdd o bryd y cyfle maen dda maen dda
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161604_0161818 i thought that was part of it but yeah okay does not matter
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162242_0162710 no we did not so what it is only interim
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162977_0163392 but yeah i guess if that is not part of it do not worry about it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0163561_0163750 because i am only going to do this for a bit of time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164726_0164813 we will just give you a break
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164813_0165282 that was the whole point this is your top one this is your bottom
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166295_0166492 that is how informative it is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166492_0166721 maer tfidf yn ysgol ddifyniadol yw hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0167959_0168230 it is not a compound
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0168416_0168525 boleh
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169308_0169412 that is a good one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169412_0169892 well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169892_0170033 merak edilecek diye bilgiye
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170303_0170774 maen ffordd mwyaf maen gwneud rhan fwyaf ar gyfer un bob tôn
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170774_0171163 you could make it more complicated and make it difficult let us not make it more complicated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0171523_0171710 the way we were doing it we were just looking for the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172042_0172133 well that is where we were i think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172133_0172283 그리고 다음
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0173224_0174008 i guess i will just do a sum of the individual tfidf for each term returned
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174008_0174408 and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174408_0174774 ac y gwych maer dynau ymddygiol ymwneudol ywr peth
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174957_0175023 video i think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175023_0175228 it is pretty crude anyway this is looking for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175414_0175908 it is all it is going to do is look for separate because then it is going to go into the nxt session
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175908_0176137 or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176137_0176267 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176267_0176403 so yeah that is the screw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176403_0176608 um
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177487_0177584 groups
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177584_0178053 yeah without doing any like um web page
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0178851_0179386 yeah then i actually that is a problem for me too so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179386_0179709 that is um yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179709_0179940 but the idea is that gives you an informative score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179940_0180210 how you combine that is up to you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180210_0180351 i guess there is lots in the literature
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180351_0180980 if you were there is a whole load about it in manning and shudder
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180980_0181393 they have got a whole chunk about it so just ir is not it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181393_0181581 so that is basically what i am actually doing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181581_0181729 they have got a good chat
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181729_0181889 if you have not got it it is uncognitive
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182495_0182581 me too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182581_0182878 hundreds of figures
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0187627_0187906 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188687_0188748 é
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188748_0188875 yeah i guess that is a few problems
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0197880_0198070 it can have its own preferences
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198070_0198284 i could have a site for myself if it is this i get
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198795_0199338 well i call it favorites
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199338_0199448 you can have a favourite
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199722_0200105 yeah it is not enough information it is not like they come back every day and do the same
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0201502_0201561 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0204803_0204956 yeah it would be quite a bit hazy yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0205719_0206009 that is not what i am suggesting i am just saying like these are
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207456_0207592 좋아
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207592_0207657 i mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208096_0208257 we will search yeah we will search yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208257_0208441 so even if it just said two things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208441_0208990 ac roedd y pethau wedii ddweud roedden nhwn mynd ir adeg yma a chael eu texnogi a chael eu cyfrifio ar gyfer y menyw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208990_0209204 and then another one that said search that led to instant news
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209204_0209467 maen rhaid i ni ddysgu mewn gwirioneddau amlwg
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209594_0209856 yeah yeah oh one that yeah one that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211013_0211248 well the only thing to do is just have search as the default
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211248_0211482 just the opens and the search window opens
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211482_0211798 and that is the interface you just go from there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212121_0212516 a yna maen mynd ir brosiell ar ôl iw gysylltu
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212516_0213348 or the search window they could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just in a go button that said take me to this oh i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213348_0213571 so they are sitting inside the surgery
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213571_0214400 so the only thing that comes up when you finish is a when you start it is just one window like that and it is got all the search stuff right down there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214400_0214615 so this is your search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214615_0215164 just over here and here let us just go to wherever we go
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215164_0215514 ac yna oedd en mynd i chi i gyd yn y ffordd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215704_0216048 and at the top it says welcome to our browser
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0216813_0216963 drop down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217344_0217656 ah you want to have
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217831_0217942 which was named the colour
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0218438_0218515 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219079_0219129 以後再會
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219733_0220248 maen bwysig os ydych chi eisiau gysylltu yw gysylltu os ydych chi eisiau edrych ar un cyfle a ddod yn ymwneud â hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220248_0220721 but then yeah as i said that is true oh yes you have two
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220721_0221165 maer un yna un yna maen rhaid i chi ddweud un or ffordd yma iw ddweud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221165_0221415 a gallwch chi ddod or un or un
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221415_0221477 go and grab your buddy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221477_0221637 i am glad you are here
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0223369_0224053 we could do microsoft is day and hold it over and it pops up a thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224202_0224302 is that complicated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224883_0225023 massive
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225023_0225259 actually let us not why do not let us do that then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225832_0226409 get out of the bloody way i am trying to scratch the door bit
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227076_0227367 yeah that is in the way
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227367_0227691 so that is why you could just have a list of your users then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227691_0227942 ac rydych chin dweud rwyn mynd i ddod or ddau or ddau
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228029_0228112 thank you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228112_0228471 a yna maen mynd ir lles or un sydd wedi cael hynny
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228471_0228698 and then you search but then you need to search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228698_0229192 maybe just leave it just have them leading names there and do not worry about the speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229192_0229367 if they are doing speakers they are doing search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229367_0229594 it is not the same it is doing the quick access
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230146_0230659 or hyn ydych chin gwybod y tex fox yna ie dwin meddwl yna mae hynnyn cymryd ie fel ydych chin mynd yno
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230659_0230821 then that does not get interesting in the way
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0232469_0232617 the full name and then speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233013_0233294 gallwn ni wneud hynnyn gweithio gydar hyn yn unig yn ystod yn ystod ymlaen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233465_0233505 i think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233723_0233769 cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233769_0233929 a thing no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233929_0234025 a mynd ir cyfle
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0234538_0234956 i think it is a night object model
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235175_0235508 maen rhaid i chi maen rhaid i chi
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235508_0235796 it is the knight rite corpus and then you have got knight rite elements
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235796_0236117 you have got no right attributes you have got lots of noms
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0236408_0237040 i think the n ones are interfaces and the n one one of the ways around one is an interface and one is actually an implemented cost
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237040_0237498 because you go back enough and they um what is his name
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237498_0237773 the api is alright but there is not a lot of description in it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237773_0237959 it is very creepy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237959_0238103 it is busy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239098_0239480 so you end up just it returns a m text box
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239480_0239560 so okay what is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239583_0240106 it is an implementation of an ntext interface
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240106_0240169 what is that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240169_0241198 it is an extended version of it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0242760_0242869 might be useful would not it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0243694_0243809 ya se te ha pomudo todo el mundo
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0244908_0245011 i forgot something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246177_0246362 just after i speak
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246973_0247021 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247021_0247144 what that means is to write
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247460_0247646 for the full list of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247646_0247742 yeah that can be fun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248492_0248785 friday morning
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248940_0248994 pretty clear
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249148_0249215 i died
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249215_0249491 maybe i am not sure what the music is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0250517_0250815 so we say three oclock and then if there is a serious problem i will take it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252439_0252628 smile what do you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252792_0252904 three x five six x five
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253216_0253648 it is just straight side side straight and then it does not problem with that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253648_0254165 maer pwmpen ar three or oed yn unrhyw fath or pwmpen ar five or six oed yn unrhyw fath
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254165_0254342 but i think that will be lost
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254982_0255215 is she collecting them no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255215_0255501 you just sent it to her
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255501_0255898 i mean that you collected oh right oh yeah sorry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256003_0256253 school for the gifted
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256327_0256480 i thought somebody was collecting them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256480_0256648 but that is what i do not really care about
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256898_0257262 then we know who is missed them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268426_0268832 yeah that would help for single terms it would be very useful
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268832_0269419 for multiple terms unless you want to do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0269767_0270631 or you could do it and override it by the you could just ignore the ranking if it does not show up together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0270631_0270975 or you could have you could penalize it you could just put a weight to do the surgery
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271207_0271446 yeah you do the nxt shirt so it does not show up together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271446_0271683 either disregard it or put a weighting against it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271683_0271921 so how many pairs you get
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272131_0272336 yeah so then just push next
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272981_0273098 yeah that is good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274286_0274539 some things you are going to get a lot of results for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274539_0274873 and it is the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom and it was actually the most relevant one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274873_0275008 something that will push it up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276454_0276627 this is the highest
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276627_0277014 and also with there is something like sunny day
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277014_0277640 the if sunny and day are not mentioned together a lot but sunny types of questions once
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277640_0277942 that its turn will be low and it will push down the other one if you combine them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277942_0278075 if you stick them together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279124_0279167 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279167_0279738 but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something is an amazing highly ranked thing from the tf ivf
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279738_0280798 it could just be normal because it falls off the bottom of the consumer you have to return all results for all so you type language and it returns seventy five meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281067_0281627 i do not know what we were doing yeah there are only seventy five meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281627_0281677 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281996_0282399 felly os ydych chin dod yn seventy five oherwydd dim ond y byddwch chin ddod
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282399_0282559 how do you rank them or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282559_0283107 when it turns twenty even if it turns twenty do you cut it off at ten do you rank them do you yeah that is true okay what is the threshold
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283107_0283196 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283425_0283566 dat is helemaal mooi
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283566_0283669 where have i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287489_0287536 is that it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287733_0287945 done
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0288070_0288203 i have timed off already
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0004764_0005099 do you have any comments
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0005099_0005160 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0006711_0006820 thank you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0010769_0011623 one thing that i was wondering is there standard control that you use to connect the different things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0011623_0012020 like if you are in the topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012020_0012646 is there a particular type of control like is there one of these nxt or sorry night controls
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012646_0012722 i think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0015854_0016228 you have not had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016228_0016669 like other topics or what we are going to do for speaker i guess
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016669_0016708 right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016779_0017338 well okay when we talk about speaker characterization how are we accessing the list of speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026808_0026979 das ist die feste des gutangens
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026979_0027329 like when he was talking about like having architecture that things are going to plug into
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027329_0027798 i mean so that things are all in one i mean it would be a good idea if we use that same idea for anything else
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027798_0027954 what else we are doing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027954_0028342 yeah even the searches or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0028342_0028849 i mean search results if they are all in a predictable thing with a name certain properties or listed properties
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0033745_0033849 have i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034053_0034342 how you gonna just play
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034378_0034788 it is just a matter of deciding what would be easiest yeah all the way around
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049224_0049723 so each time are you going straight to the xml files for the information no there is an object file
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049723_0049757 this is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049757_0049850 a whole lot of love
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049850_0049965 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049965_0050004 thank you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050258_0050422 without one k
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050422_0050663 so that is all just pre processed yeah it is all pre processed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051309_0051345 so what you do is you take a little bit of the white and you take a little bit of the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051959_0052044 and object right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0052811_0053116 is it for the entire corpus
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053116_0053476 or is it just like individual ones like one object for one object for each major
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053476_0053540 thank you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053540_0053686 i am only two million people
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053919_0054132 i wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we are doing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054132_0054324 right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054355_0054385 it is just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054871_0054911 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0056609_0057022 or just return a null or a blank or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0060208_0060258 so it does not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071484_0071909 actually i can upload my stuff as well i just have to make one change to your phone
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071909_0072240 just to load this one instead of the default
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0072240_0072566 so that is two lines of code
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073070_0073163 um what do you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073336_0073698 well yeah just the one thing that is like the action for loading up the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074114_0074311 well your version
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074427_0074693 i did in my directory just do it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074876_0075176 um i have a copy yes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075176_0075245 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075245_0075906 but i will yeah i was going to update that one just yeah it just makes sense that well just tell me when because i usually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076114_0076300 and then update
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076547_0076744 yeah i have not really changed it too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076744_0076902 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076902_0077102 i will just make that one and let you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077311_0077597 because yeah like i said two lines of code
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077597_0078132 and then you can play
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078132_0078233 there is not much to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078233_0078625 i have to get better results
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078938_0079543 yeah and just to wire in the topics and we do them in some ways
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0079543_0080115 i mean the highlighting stuff well also yeah like that as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080115_0080211 so yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080297_0080874 and just wanna find out what kind of objects that were for the other ones
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080874_0081304 so it goes in the highlights
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0082326_0082359 different
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085593_0085681 okay sounds good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085892_0086548 okay there is a few more things to do with that and then once panela gets the index
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086548_0086820 i think that is gonna be kind of fun
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086820_0087170 i am just wondering if you had to well the way you are doing it i was gonna ask if the way you were doing it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087170_0087588 reloading like a new corpus each time for each meaning but you are doing the object
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087588_0088289 so you do not need to just cause if we are if we do have like the inverted search says that there is young
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0088289_0089001 ten documents are we gonna have to look each of these ten quote just to do the individual next next t shirt
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0089380_0089533 it probably it is a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090150_0090373 hi
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090373_0090406 do them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090860_0091294 maen rhaid i chi ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091294_0091408 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091738_0092049 otherwise you guys are like oh no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0093795_0093898 i feel that in now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099112_0099725 it is an sd browser some speech and some music
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099725_0099959 i do not know what that is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099959_0100154 it does not take too long
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100154_0100590 we have to while we are debugging
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100590_0100987 but now or something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103440_0103544 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103783_0103949 and that because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104515_0104905 i was just going to ask if we should assume that they will want to load a meeting first but not necessarily
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104905_0105239 i guess if you are doing a search on the entire
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0105765_0105892 and through that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0106555_0106792 well we can put the chicken in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107270_0107714 i could probably even that should not be too hard to put a check in there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107714_0107884 and if it has not loaded then force them to load it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111723_0111938 unless they know what meaning it is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111938_0112083 وانا قد
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0113546_0114127 or well the things i mean just be looking for a word and you know if it shows up ten different meetings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114127_0114868 then at that point they will probably want to like do we want to like if it done by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returne
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114868_0114978 я не могу это сказать
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115184_0115431 well like to order like the thing is i think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115580_0116003 like when it loads up it will load up the transcript window and whatever other window
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116003_0116206 right now i think just the topic ones
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116206_0116826 although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116826_0117456 so i am just thinking if it is kind of like you were saying you have to have a norm object
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117456_0117835 i mean if we do i search it all yeah but local search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117876_0117953 candle level
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117953_0118007 아 그렇죠
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118453_0118825 yeah but the okay the global one feeds into the local
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118825_0119318 so if we are getting any useful data it is going to be doing a search on each of those files
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0119318_0119664 so it is going to be loading up each and every time to get the data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0120470_0120896 but it could be time consuming like if there are ten documents that paper is in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121424_0121743 um yeah well just thinking of some way we could you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121743_0122317 catch the results in a nice little format that will make things a bit easier
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0122317_0123043 but the thing is i mean if we have got that then it is going to be needing really to load the entire corpus for that meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123043_0123539 if it is trying to show us where those were if it is trying to highlight those in text or transcript or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123539_0123775 and we are going to have to have all that other day in there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123775_0124048 so each time when we have the surgeon going we have like you know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124048_0124307 attend different meetings the word wireless comes up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124307_0124688 go to meeting one of the investors
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124688_0124836 next one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124836_0125272 i mean that is kind of yeah it is not too slow though i do not think it is not too bad
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125272_0125338 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125539_0126076 it always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least like that is all yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126076_0126392 tested threshold management shutdown order
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126392_0126975 yeah so just sort of based on that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126975_0127464 but if it does not take that long each time then it should be alright
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0128741_0128774 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0129973_0130006 it is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0130824_0131060 from these emotions
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131060_0131406 and that way i think i will specifically which meaning it is i will save the time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131406_0131880 because i am sure they do not want to have the extra loading time either they can avoid it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131880_0132180 so yeah or they can check more i think it is the ones they want to check
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0132988_0133108 i think they were in the text room
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0133108_0133838 we can probably do that ourselves and just sort of vdb you do not just do a stream
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134088_0134278 oh do they do they
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134278_0134441 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134441_0134649 like the working group that it is part of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134767_0134902 a proper disusio

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135999_0136107 if that is accurate
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0138712_0139019 do you actually need the frequencies
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139480_0139554 oh right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139574_0139634 okay okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140160_0140436 well the thing is if it is being done if somebody is done the key by so
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140755_0141096 there is a class she was trying to get to work on friday
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141096_0141729 they did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141729_0142205 but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff but the last i heard it was not working
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142205_0142825 so she is going to look at more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142825_0143125 but if we need the if we do need the frequencies
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143368_0143467 um i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143784_0144054 well it would have been like a list of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0144389_0144452 what does that stand for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147353_0147533 cool cool i am still a data
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147533_0147825 see you later
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147825_0148187 plus a stop list so you remove stuff that does not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0149632_0149922 what is the i in tfidf inverse
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0150668_0150690 something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158468_0158525 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158525_0158712 that is what i am thinking too do we need to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158712_0159014 i mean we are just like oh for your stuff
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0159014_0159111 know but that is what this is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0161982_0162591 i do not think we had that in the document no we did not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162649_0162718 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162718_0162746 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0163504_0163648 yeah thanks
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0164960_0165013 i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165013_0165350 actually because things i mean this is your top one this is your bottom yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165350_0165897 but the thing is we are just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they are looking for a particular term or something
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165897_0166317 they just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and i want to see it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0167571_0168186 but if it is like a two word term does a tfidf
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168186_0168529 it is not a compound noun it is just two words together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168529_0168814 um i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168814_0168924 i do not know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168924_0169280 to something like edinburgh university
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169446_0169675 i am just kidding
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169675_0169803 sunny days
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169803_0169843 you are good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0170922_0171222 let us not make it more complicated
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171385_0171739 because the thing is the thing is that the way we were doing it we were just looking for the words
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171739_0172055 period each word in the index
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172055_0172193 that is what we were thinking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172193_0172508 and then it is just saying were these two words in any of these documents
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172508_0173238 if it was not we would go closer and do the next stage yeah look for the exact term or the regular expression
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0175914_0176170 or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176170_0176242 that is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176617_0176931 i am just wondering if it is going to give us something cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176931_0177652 if it is sort of like if the nxt search has still got to be run to find these terms or these groups
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0177957_0178333 or also like do wild cards work for something like that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178333_0178889 so if you are looking for a wireless wired wire blah blah blah you can do wire with a star
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178889_0179192 actually that is a problem for me too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179192_0179324 so work
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179324_0179364 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179683_0179870 but the idea is that gives you new friends
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180329_0180467 it is just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180467_0180583 okay if you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180583_0180653 world
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181036_0181057 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181454_0181530 i actually do not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181880_0182342 yeah i have got somewhere pdf
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182591_0182876 hundreds of figures
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182876_0183163 do the pdf switch it to postscript switch it back to pdf
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183580_0183640 ugh
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183640_0183894 okay is that okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0184522_0184819 nou oké
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0186835_0186923 we
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0187258_0187797 probably for the most part i mean there will be a set of people that do analysis
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188405_0188759 search for stuff start working yeah i guess i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188759_0189152 yeah i guess that is usually or browse okay like search browse
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189349_0189594 like if you are looking for something specific like is that what you are thinking
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189594_0190013 like if they know exactly where they want to go they want to go to that meeting on december third
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190401 they just go there and see stuff then they can go and browse yeah i want to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0191972_0192304 browse by meeting browse by blog browse by speaker
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192304_0192679 like no i am just thinking of different ways we can do that like different buttons on the top
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192679_0193086 like if they are looking for a particular person particular working group particular whatever
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193086_0193671 and we just we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193671_0193905 where we could keep it more general
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195177_0195627 yeah but i am just thinking like initially when they load up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195627_0195904 what are the range of things that they would want to do
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195904_0196265 like if they are part of x working group they will want to get in there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196265_0196481 do we want to save preferences
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196786_0197287 well if they are part of bdb working group they are going to want to look at the bdb ones and so default to that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197287_0197384 mm
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197610_0198058 based on what they did last time they can have a say preferences
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199005_0199280 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199424_0199910 yeah okay just scroll down the list and find your favourite one yeah it is not enough information
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200239_0200457 お腹が空いてる
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200457_0200585 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200585_0200849 i forget
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200922_0201065 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201065_0201541 well no i am just getting back to sort of what could be on the startup screen
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201541_0201912 like there is just a range of things we could do we could have like search options browse options
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201912_0202445 i am just playing around with ideas
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0202445_0203527 and then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say well if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203527_0203630 and then do this blah blah blah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203630_0203968 two k oh right yeah guide them
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203968_0204271 it is just like hey my task is to do this and there is a button for it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204271_0204383 perfect
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204383_0204496 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204496_0204529 the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204529_0204737 아
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205682_0205884 no that is not what i am suggesting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205884_0206558 i am just saying like these are just like a lot of programs well kind of lame programs do have that sort of thing first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0206558_0207407 just because they do not want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the program
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207407_0207598 as well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207992_0208211 probably research something research yeah research
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209137_0209471 i just instantly i just search like a fine specific meeting
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209471_0209691 yeah that is a really good show
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0210971_0211077 it is just crazy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217577_0217753 well we do not actually have usernames do we
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217753_0218050 are not there all these codes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218519_0218657 in a case like that we do want to talk to him
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218657_0218789 we do not want them to type from doing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219359_0219525 and allow multiple
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219563_0219865 okay you are just looking for one specific
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0221052_0221142 amazing what this is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0224492_0224581 from tool two
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0227069_0227251 yeah that is true that is annoying
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230548_0230731 bu en iyi
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230731_0230930 maybe that is the best idea then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234609_0234815 i do not get muddled lines
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234815_0235146 i think in that case it is the right corpus
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235146_0235208 no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235208_0235417 ie maen rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi dd oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi dd oedd y
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0236358_0236513 yeah next
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0239953_0240051 there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240638_0240914 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240914_0240980 definitely
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0241644_0241921 i am really just going to keep on going
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0242621_0243025 might be useful would not it like friday afternoons
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0243877_0244106 then we will not have to have the meeting with steve on tuesday
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244106_0244159 portal
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244241_0244628 so do we want to arrange this get this one earlier
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244628_0244888 three if you like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245098_0245167 that is true
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245587_0245678 okay yeah sure
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246596_0246706 possibly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246706_0246996 usually by the influence of need a break
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246996_0247596 i do not know because it is the lab and trying to get some work done for the latest stuff
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248060_0248216 okay right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248216_0248298 and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248688_0248940 three oclock
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248940_0249187 pretty good
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249187_0249353 maybe i think i am not sure
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249353_0249436 de classique
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249767_0249998 i think she is got a class at eleven
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249998_0250371 we have all got class twelve three of us have class twelve
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250371_0250565 how about
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250776_0250894 or if we could try one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250894_0251001 we could try shortly after
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251001_0251148 yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251148_0251339 what would be a long reading
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251339_0251379 for you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251379_0251707 would you want to no probably not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251707_0251921 if one is bad for you then you will not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252235_0252278 okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252855_0252933 yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259469_0259873 that was just sort of the basic implementation stuff that i was really involved in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259873_0260094 but it should be fine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260094_0260376 in a professional
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260376_0260692 do we decide whether it should be ranked
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260798_0260979 really well basically
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0261426_0262136 well i kind of think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262136_0262837 just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document it is not really getting them together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262837_0263091 like if someone is looking for a particular term
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263091_0263526 i do not know just do not know if it would bring us that much
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263668_0263708 awesome
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264093_0264561 if they are looking for like i say sunny day and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264561_0264931 sunny shows up in this document dave shows up with them up together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264931_0265179 or if they are
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0265179_0265811 it just does not you are looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0268462_0268812 for single serves it would be very useful
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0269500_0269766 to do something pretty simple
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270757_0270985 penalize it you can spot a great
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270985_0271210 stuff through the nxt search then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271210_0271367 yeah he did the nxt shirt so it does not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271367_0271506 together either just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271599_0271853 waiting against it so how many pairs you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271853_0272207 it would not show up on the search results if it did not exist
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0272813_0273225 we will have to talk to brunella about this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0273225_0273883 if we are using that i mean it does make sense for that but uh no i am just actually uh
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274305_0274557 some things you are going to get a lot of results for

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278040_0278313 the things i mean that will be exactly how we are doing it now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278313_0278617 like we are just looking for the two words separately see if they exist in the same document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278617_0278907 and if they do then there is a possibility that they occur together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278907_0279111 and then we do the unaccessory on that document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0279318_0279373 moments

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032314_0032693 i think when you left click or right click or something i can not remember now
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032835_0033593 but if it is a real error then it stops yeah i did not discover any of those

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059782_0060580 but it would be difficult if in the speaker characterisation window we had a heading in a top five dialogue act

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089655_0089703 something is wrong

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094383_0094598 but i will have to import it somehow
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094598_0094669 ma non cè un
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094912_0095078 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0096698_0096891 can you even hear me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0097278_0097652 welcome to the meeting can we get sound on these machines
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0098936_0099810 if the sound card is registered to your name which it usually is not and you have to reboot and sometimes it is a bit of a surprise
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0109184_0109734 that is it next to your package cool to see that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110371_0110848 i mean sometimes i have methods that do not have any explanation to them at all
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110848_0111427 i think it was
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0114594_0114697 i thought we said
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116565_0116699 like a tea
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116932_0117417 well that is the problem because steve has not given us any details has he
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118045_0118119 that is sort of the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118486_0118681 i actually thought about it in the meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118798_0118957 just brainstorm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119308_0119597 the thing is yeah we had the deadline last friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119597_0120310 but we will not be able to do an evaluation during the weekend anyway so i think we could set monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0120589_0120727 and that will give us the whole plan
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124504_0124539 영상편집 안정은 kbs
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124539_0124631 i think that is why we are
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125696_0125814 exakt
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125814_0126195 at the end we will say you never gave us any tests or things
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126439_0126709 well sort of that is how i understand he said he would try
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126709_0126933 he would make something up okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126933_0127272 yeah find some people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0127272_0127400 the thing is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0128207_0129005 i think if we do not get anything from him then we should just do our friends basically
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0129539_0129786 well they are your friend they are gonna start a show
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130084_0130181 you take it all
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130181_0130389 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0131849_0132005 like highly computer like
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132005_0132102 they will be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132203_0132302 it will have to be now
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0133368_0133554 i was thinking of like ten
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135493_0135700 we do not want to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135848_0136057 look all stupid
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137042_0137183 i mean they should just have two
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137207_0137686 like that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0138306_0139183 another thing we have the presentation in one and a half weeks or something
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139183_0139283 nearly two weeks
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139470_0139766 oh it is true yeah it is two weeks then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139766_0140033 do we have to have done the evaluation by then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141001_0141075 i understand
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141075_0141211 twenty fourth

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0143656_0144109 well you know the question is do we need the evaluation for the presentation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144673_0144807 we should definitely ask him
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144807_0144937 because if not then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0146055_0146174 yeah you might be right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0147522_0147750 because we needed to write a presentation as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148526_0148668 exactly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148668_0148771 that is mean

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157354_0157436 a part of the dinner
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157584_0157793 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157793_0158247 i mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158247_0158353 and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158660_0158735 what was the other one

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169906_0170600 well i will need your snippets of code or if we could if i had them by tomorrow evening
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0170935_0171105 oh i was gonna ask um
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171289_0171434 at the moment your search window
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171565_0171657 how is it organized
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172507_0172809 but at the beginning when you have not searched yet
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172809_0173357 maer balon nin ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir holl hŷn yn ddod ir ho
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0173882_0174181 and then if you i do not know double click on one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0175887_0175963 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0176802_0177381 well it is jacob yeah it is beautiful
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0177559_0178451 yeah maybe you want to do left handed yeah one left click highlights the result in whatever you have got open
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178805_0178847 together
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178969_0179185 various like different the topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0179185_0179812 usually one left click it is highlights it cross highlights everything i think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181008_0181185 well it is difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181679_0181767 well thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182347_0182533 no it is difficult
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182533_0182797 because the transcription window does cross highlighting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182924_0183290 in a very awkward way because it has to find the topic first
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183290_0183584 that was a pain
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183744_0184682 and when you when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0184682_0185363 and that works when you left double click on a topic on a meeting sorry then it loads it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185470_0185530 so you can
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185645_0185769 you could take that for loading
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185971_0186525 so if we have that the same on this one at least that you if you double left click then it loads
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187847_0187994 highlights yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187994_0188550 i mean obviously highlights whatever you have clicked on here oh just let them be but also highlights
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0188848_0188969 maen ddifogol oherwydd
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0189484_0190231 because you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be open well i suppose if you have a local search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190231_0190333 then it could cross our line
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190932_0191506 oherwydd os ydych chin mynd yn ôl o ran o brydau gwahanol yma a dwi wedi cael unrhyw fath o fath or hyn gallwch chi ddod or hyn
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0193267_0193395 what do you mean by that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0194506_0194561 so come on
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0195663_0195780 oh i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0196279_0197295 well in any case if you left click on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open then it should cross highlight yes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0197295_0197410 if not you can not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200617_0200677 can you make a
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200781_0201493 is it very difficult to make another gui but only for a global search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0201930_0202490 just take that away the local checkbox
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202490_0202650 kuz orada
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202772_0202979 ie oherwydd ymlaen ysgolion y gallwch ei gael
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203231_0203342 yeah would you make that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203342_0203575 that is quite strong for me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203575_0203798 everything else can just stay the same you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203798_0204134 in fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbox
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0204584_0204934 radio book
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0216087_0216123 we are done

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0026083_0026667 it is all right about that i was recording on that what did you actually do on the screen

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029599_0030007 it generated a lot of exceptions in the background
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0030007_0030205 but that did not cause any problems
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033280_0033537 yeah i did not discover any of those yet
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033537_0033821 para ti no me lo esque
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033821_0034404 roeddwn in ffroeddio i weld a ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd oedd yn ddod oedd oedd oedd yn ddod oedd o
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034404_0034674 and the startup screen is going to get pixel right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034674_0034783 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036267_0036363 no that is right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036363_0036835 the only thing is the startup screen is not too pretty
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036835_0037111 i am on it as travis
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038021_0038352 no it is not it is not it is not not the top priority
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038566_0038773 i think it would look better on wind eyes as well actually
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038773_0039024 because java uses the native windows does not it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0039343_0039428 actually can we
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0040098_0040140 to the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0041480_0041897 well the um the um the speech characterisation is finished
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042029_0042437 i have not updated all those objects because it takes ages on these computers
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042437_0042884 maen ffastr oherwydd unrhyw rhan os ydw in log in ymlaen ac ynan gweithior codi
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042884_0043116 it runs it much faster than here while i do it here
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043276_0043666 wait it does it does cut off to sit in the lab and wait for them
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043889_0044535 that is right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0044535_0044929 really speed it up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045839_0045916 that is the way
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045916_0046646 so that tells you what speakers are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0046646_0046715 so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047380_0047894 maer diologau yn cael ei wneud ac maer cyfnodau yma yn ei wneud
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047894_0048815 but some of them some of the things actually what i wanted to talk about in that little box was there are some that occur all the time that i just and i do not know how interesting there are
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0048815_0049448 so the first one statement is that it will be removed because it was like everything is prefixed by statement
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0049448_0050088 every single dialogue act starts with statement and so everybody is top dialogue act statement
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050088_0050129 so
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050245_0050314 so i will go into that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050314_0050682 and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050682_0050792 i do not know what that means
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050792_0050952 who knows what was it back channel
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051210_0051277 is that what that means
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051277_0051370 oh keep going
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051370_0051605 and then the other sequence
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051884_0051947 some people do not know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051947_0052095 there are some people who do not do that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052095_0052411 actually yeah you can see that they do not do that and it is the bottom of their list
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052523_0052876 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052876_0053288 some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0053288_0053572 so which
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054120_0054797 that is the thing i wanted to know whether or not we because at the moment you can get there is a method that will just give you the top five or the top x
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054797_0055107 so you give it any number it will give you the top whatever for each person
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0055107_0056001 a ynar ystod y cyfnod yn gwybod am yr holl ddialogau arall ar gyfer y cyfnod a ynar amser y byddai hynnyn cael ei wneud
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056001_0056677 and we will give you that in top order as well or you can just search for each specific dialogue act
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056677_0057267 mae angen i chi ddysgu yn b is a ks yn ymwneud â ddwy ffordd rhan
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057267_0057447 but i can change that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057447_0057616 so i do not know what we want to display
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057616_0057967 i know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0058705_0058934 all the lot all the lot twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0059098_0059276 i mean do we care
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061270_0061732 i think we should have the global top five because each speaker is got a top whatever
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061732_0062279 felly roedd un or box wedii ddysgu dyma fy nghymdeithas five point zero x ir ddysgu
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0062279_0062926 and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speakers top dialects
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063063_0063146 either of those would do
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063146_0063342 but it would start thinking about the space and you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063541_0063654 well you could have no you do not need that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063654_0063991 so he is because it is because it is a speaker window the speaker characterization when he comes up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063991_0064404 felly mae gennych chir un ymlaen yno ac yna gallwch chi ddod or five or cyfle yn y cyfle hwn
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0064404_0064962 ac ynar five or five yn y cyfle yma yn y cyfle yma ac ynar rest yn yn bwysig
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066048_0066086 that can
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066256_0066714 ond yn ddiweddar y pethaun ddaeth yn ddaeth pethau fel llwyth yn ddaeth yn ddaeth yn ddaeth llawer
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066714_0067023 well they do sometimes but they are not that common
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067023_0067170 one guy has top five chugging
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067170_0067229 one of his tokens
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067229_0067328 he is an undergird
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067328_0067396 bye bye
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067426_0068442 this is good for browsing though
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0068558_0068633 use the joke
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069233_0069679 it is taking till the next joke
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069860_0070409 that would be quite good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0072044_0072846 beth ywr perthynas or diologau y maen ei wneud yn y cyfnod ar blynyddoedd
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073056_0073347 i think most things are coded with a dialogue act
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073347_0073526 a lot of them are called z which means no labels
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073526_0073733 felly roeddwn in gweld hynny
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073733_0073790 accessible
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073946_0074059 ar ystafell y maen anodd
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074059_0074781 and also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something so if i quote a joke to you they separate that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074781_0075165 so they put the dialogue act and they put a double the colon and they put that aside
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075165_0075639 ond roeddwn i wedi gwneud unrhyw materiaethau cyfrifol oherwydd yw hynnyn rhan or gwaith
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075639_0075772 yeah somebody else is doing it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075772_0076025 so you have to be original about your material
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0076025_0076404 well that is a bad credit too
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077423_0077500 yes we got it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077500_0077559 да

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082410_0082679 it does not seem to make any difference i have never ever used driving packages

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0106575_0107074 i still can not make it from tnt from java maybe i will try
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107074_0107140 yeah you turn

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112554_0112756 it is good to know what methods are there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112756_0112904 without having to look at the source code
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112904_0112944 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0113268_0113370 this is not

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133265_0133358 really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133528_0133914 no it would take forever and then you gotta analyse the results
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133914_0134088 like you think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0135705_0136941 mae gennym un cyfansoddiad cyffredin un dydd or swyddi

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145149_0145491 we should try and have it done by then anyway
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145491_0145868 otherwise it starts in the game you know that is probably tight otherwise
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146247_0146629 we should aim to be finished by monday this monday coming
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146629_0146885 yn ogystal âr ddau
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146885_0147214 start the evaluation pretty much straight away and then yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147364_0147545 yeah and then get
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147696_0147872 rwyn mynd i weithior reportau a phryd

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199655_0200097 you have to get the topics out instead of the segments
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0200097_0200142 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0204919_0205171 you are going to be able to do a global search for topics
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205569_0205767 is that what you mean
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205965_0206035 me

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206264_0206444 what i do not think we are going to bother with that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206444_0206625 well you can not say that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206625_0206726 yeah that is what it is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0207919_0208441 well we will do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it but we are not going to do it at the very least
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209642_0209821 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209821_0209934 do not ever do that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209934_0210340 er enghraifft os ywn gallu gwneud rhai cyfnodau
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210340_0210705 dwi ddim yn credu ein bod yn gallu ei ddweud y byddwch chin mynd i weithio gydar sefydliadau hynny hefyd
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210877_0210998 if you are creating it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210998_0211183 they like taste yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211183_0211507 yeah i have got great ex muffles but i have got no idea

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211992_0212200 en dit ligt ervan de mensen willen ik
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212200_0212531 i swear it is not as straightforward as writing in xml files
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212531_0212781 but it is organizing the segment later
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212781_0213044 it just looks so complicated to get it from
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0213203_0214288 the um from a plain text file back into organized by who which speaker speaks what and how doing the segment i think that was the stupidest way they could ever all think of the last meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214288_0214589 organise it by time not by speed
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214589_0214771 thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214959_0215201 절대 안

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011518_0011696 no that is just summary
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011754_0011982 no
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012309_0012442 oh right this way

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012988_0013625 i did not have privileges to get in to update your file
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0013625_0014060 i actually meant to send the email and then just continue
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014324_0014843 check the read write in the yeah because i forget mine as well and it is just like you know every time i put something in there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014843_0015002 so yeah i was down
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015002_0015254 that was the main thing so as soon as that is in it will be ready
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015254_0015416 i was making a couple of little changes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015416_0015672 so those will be able to play with
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015672_0016188 still working on the trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016188_0016478 so that is that is where tonight
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016478_0016680 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016680_0016966 come on
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016966_0017340 i am getting a better feel for all these night objects
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017545_0017761 it is just it seems a little chaos
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017761_0018272 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018272_0018612 and you spend the time to invest and learn all about the best like
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018612_0018924 what is the minimum i can get give me what we need
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018924_0019419 unless i want to do something with this in the future
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019590_0019753 peace
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019753_0020065 dear
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020065_0020117 mm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020297 anyway so yeah that is about it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020934_0020962 i think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021106_0021208 i think i think yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021208_0021506 i saw that and i am just trying to remember if i did create it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021506_0022321 i think i was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago so that may be mine
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022549_0022601 oh really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022863_0022940 yeah that is right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022940_0023032 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023032_0023273 yeah it is hard again to think of this as a
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023273_0023456 yeah it was me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023456_0023857 um but yeah those those
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024270_0024714 i am sorry
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024880_0025008 yes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025008_0025238 leute
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025238_0025333 i promise i am joking
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026232_0026377 i was recording that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026377_0026667 what did i actually do to not have to put that on
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026667_0026774 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026774_0026982 so we probably will not have to worry about it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0027676_0027902 そうですね
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028023_0028142 mm hmm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028142_0028236 how is everything else going
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0029902_0029991 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030189_0030281 do we want to keep that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030281_0030441 like are we keeping that how that happens
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030441_0031056 it just prints everything out in the shell as well because it does everything i guess that is its default behavior
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031056_0031237 so that is just kind of it does not really do anything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031237_0031329 son
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0032007_0032077 oh right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0034811_0035151 i was more or less just playing with the things that to do directly with what i was doing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035151_0035394 so i did not take it for a full test run
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035394_0035525 bit of time you can do that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035525_0035715 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0036863_0037115 i am sorry this job is not listening to me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038183_0038603 yeah i think it is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038603_0038718 they look better on wind eyes as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038718_0038753 i do not see it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038753_0038799 ne
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0039372_0039778 actually can we run it on windows
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040120_0040237 is it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040589_0040879 were you using like a gui builder or just all from the phone
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040968_0041094 okay and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041310_0041492 that is nice
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041892_0041987 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043448_0043867 can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043867_0043909 hey
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043909_0044253 no that is fine
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0044253_0044625 i have done stuff like that before it is insane it really speeded up
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0050822_0050856 always
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0051559_0051733 it is kind of boring
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0054913_0054979 or whatever

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059359_0059504 i do not know it does not really matter
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059504_0059733 if we just automatically filter these out
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0061216_0061303 i think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067906_0067986 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067986_0068106 this is good for browsing though
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068106_0068152 that is funny
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068152_0068407 i mean that is right it is like it was money given
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068407_0068548 yeah

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075358_0075462 let us do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075513_0075642 it was a marvellous joke anyways
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077116_0077494 okay that sounds good so that is sort of complemented now or is that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077764_0077829 yeah i just have to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0078649_0079199 when i am done typing i will just recompile the end browsers and then just get that you will
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079280_0079699 so it uses my private one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0080103 actually do we have a naming convention for source files
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080103_0080384 just prefix them with an n yeah obviously
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080690_0080798 that is sort of what i was doing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080798_0081025 like for your stuff do you have
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081163_0081249 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081369_0081562 it does not matter at this point
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081562_0081701 nah just curious
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081701_0081885 oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082092_0082165 yeah that is true too
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082282_0082406 yeah that is what i mean

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091249_0091487 it is possible something is not right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091487_0091840 some people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091917_0092258 let me go check see if i can find anything
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0092806_0093153 how do you add that to the java program
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093153_0093342 is it just basic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093342_0093493 it is really easy you do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094287_0094388 これ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094440_0094501 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094688_0094729 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095016_0095251 also it will do the automatic scrunching down if it is good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095251_0095320 ik ben er niet
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0096153_0096712 it is a distinctive experience i guess
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097105_0097311 no
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097451_0097610 do you get sound on these machines
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097654_0098357 have you ever managed to play any sort of music on the dice machines
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098357_0098436 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098676_0098758 do not break for any time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098758_0098971 if
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0099427_0099484 thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100612_0100744 live on youtube
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100972_0101247 okay well this looks good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103314_0103778 and we are going to be trying to get the output from that i do not know still have not found out if it is sound
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103900_0104113 feasible to open up more than one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104113_0104744 as many nom objects as we can for each meeting to do like we were going to figure that the ranking did make sense
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104744_0105104 like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105104_0105252 so we are going to look through only five of them
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105252_0105882 just pick the top five to do the search and that is probably what we are looking for in a ways
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106821_0106975 seriously
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106975_0107255 maybe i will try yeah you try maybe you make it work
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0107377_0107864 well yeah that would be surprising
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0108383_0108461 yeah that is rich
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109005_0109126 yeah it was just like
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109126_0109300 practical job
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109808_0110031 how do you guys find the documentation for next to you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110161_0110304 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110304_0110440 smile
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112103_0112218 yeah can go
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112218_0112577 well it is still this research platform
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112911_0113066 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113122_0113211 i am just curious
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113883_0114458 did we have a date for when we actually want the system done
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0114458_0115163 it was nice was not it i thought we said yeah we changed it to the tap or something
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115163_0115809 because the thing is i mean we can keep working on little things
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115809_0115932 to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0116104_0116933 so i do not do we want to set an actual hard deadline for like when exactly were we going to start the evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117358_0117427 okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117427_0117920 well yeah i guess we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for the people and just you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117920_0118139 come up with scenarios that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118139_0118504 i mean that is fairly straightforward
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118504_0118703 i am sure it is been time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118703_0118805 yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118805_0119034 just brainstorming
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120063_0120141 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120773_0120899 to work on it as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121052_0121445 i have got my znlg presentation on monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121445_0121759 i threw the paper
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0122268_0122340 yeah that is what i am saying
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123133_0123383 well probably if they talk to steve at some point in time i guess
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123383_0123515 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123676_0123949 we will probably just have a regular tuesday meeting with him
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123949_0124267 we could send him an email but i do not know if he is around
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124267_0124755 he is not around this week is he i think that is why we did not have the meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124939_0125003 mm hmm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125180_0125261 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125261_0125430 although do we really want the answer
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125430_0125786 so if you do not ask we can push it off
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127258_0127312 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127630_0127793 all right
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127793_0127917 i am looking for volunteers
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129036_0129224 yeah if they have time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129224_0129346 it is satisfying people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129674_0129833 i̇yimişiz
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130060_0130210 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130210_0130370 yeah that is true
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130898_0131310 actually some of my friends in different programs might be more willing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131310_0131482 have more of a break
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131482_0131772 so get a range of types of people as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131772_0132330 like not like highly computer like not like wedding slitter it to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132330_0132565 that might be good as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132565_0132750 set a wider range of people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132950_0133165 i just think like three or four maybe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133165_0133775 that would be good really i was thinking of like ten no it is like forever
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133872_0133975 exactly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133975_0134636 like the thing did an hci course a while ago and it is just that is what they there is three people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134718_0134790 that was fine
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134790_0135144 then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135305_0135407 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135407_0135572 we do not want it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135862_0136947 one dude off the suite
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137425_0137628 that is beautiful
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137628_0137769 i am gonna go
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137769_0137988 but yeah if he finds them then that is cool
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137988_0138094 which it finds people
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138094_0138215 thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138516_0138578 oh right here
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0139203_0139271 nearly two weeks
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140242_0140610 i thought evaluation may be for the report
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140610_0140752 so that is the end of it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140752_0140882 i like it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140882_0140970 i thought that was it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140970_0141080 that is what i understood
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141247_0141500 i thought you said twenty fourth
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141500_0141952 even though it is good friday it is not good friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142066_0142163 oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142163_0142403 easter too wow it is not a good friday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142418_0142656 no
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142656_0143082 i am sure on the website it says thursday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143247_0143567 so that gives us two days to do the evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143567_0143766 no evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143766_0143830 i do not know do not look
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144144_0144408 i did not think so necessarily
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144408_0144537 i would not assume
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144537_0144643 but we should ask them
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145641_0145965 yeah that is probably tight otherwise it is a good target
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145965_0146120 yeah you might
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147092_0147205 straight away and then yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147902_0148058 it is funny
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148058_0148276 it is just funny to have it finish by monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148276_0148594 because after monday i am pretty much free for about a week or so exactly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148594_0149073 it is like if we had a bit more time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149456_0149558 oh the next one okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149558_0149960 yeah i am free after this monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149960_0150359 that is easy compared to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150359_0150594 i mean i am worried about that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150724_0150827 and chess
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150827_0150890 でいます
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151378_0151464 you did not fast
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151464_0151692 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151692_0151764 how is yours
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151929_0152096 haha
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0152773_0153143 maybe that was us then not him yeah that is why i am trying to
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153143_0153293 oh i actually made a process sucking
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153647_0153757 yeah thursday twenty four
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154007_0154164 deadline for submission of the plan
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154502_0154676 well now you can end of lectures
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155209_0155380 so turn the thoughts on
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155884_0156315 just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156649_0156753 we should have it done anyway
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156753_0156839 thank you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157128_0157274 hopefully but it is still important
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157274_0157747 is that a part of the demonstration do they want that information
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0159586_0159628 over
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160781_0160938 i am feeling a few little things
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160938_0161185 just made some comments at the last meeting
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161185_0161535 just generally how it all integrates blah blah blah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161535_0161657 do we know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161997_0162216 i would expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162406_0162725 although it is fifty percent of the mark i think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162725_0162768 mm hmm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163174_0163343 well we have a bit of time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163473_0163524 it is going to be good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0164978_0165201 just to fine tune in your details
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165315_0165359 more
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165717_0166013 yeah that could be that could easily be like five or six page
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169046_0169143 dzięki za uwagę
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169143_0169262 no big rush
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169501_0169604 although just to get it out of the way
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169604_0169952 so i am trying to remember to do that tomorrow
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0171732_0172201 just basic pretty much like the interim do you want to do you have the interim stuff
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0172201_0172565 just sort of like google type thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0173517_0173764 and as these come up they will just pop over there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174233_0174429 it does not do anything yet
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174429_0174744 that is the other big part
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174744_0175073 i mean how to get that communication between the two different kinds of windows
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175461_0175946 because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175946_0176441 that was why i was sort of deciding to get the three pains in there instead of just the one
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0176699_0177347 yeah so there is a couple of those little things there yeah i do beautiful
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0177347_0177529 yeah and makes more sense
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178574_0178779 is that how it works in the other ones
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178779_0179183 and like the other windows like various like yeah different the topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0179927_0180420 if you have like a particular window that you want me to mimic it is behavior
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180420_0180825 then just find it in the program and just say okay just how this one does it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180825_0181051 so if it is like the topic window or the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0181663_0182241 so i can sort of trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring them into here
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0187581_0187863 so one left click just highlights
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188300_0188413 i will just let him
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188570_0188695 the transcript or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0189392_0189561 even if you could just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0190694_0190785 that should be close
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191221_0191242 time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191550_0191944 although yeah this will this is actually different from how we printed up here
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191944_0192057 like if we are doing global search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192057_0192623 then we are going to do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192623_0192899 and then we will either multi select or you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192899_0193337 choose the one we want to actually do this i think multi select would make more sense
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193337_0193727 well just if there is like three of the top meetings like we said before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193727_0194086 language we are looking for the little word language and get the highest rated ones
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194086_0194615 actually look for the terms we are not loading it on fall seventy six
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194615_0195308 so the results from that will narrow down what we are going to use for the local search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195308_0195571 and we will just do the local search on those ones that are chosen
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195571_0195821 i think we can oh i see what you mean yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195821_0196372 so it will be a bit different from how that is right now when we do the research at least
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197254_0197407 yes if not you can not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197407_0197508 good time
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0201665_0201959 so that we search two different
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0202422_0202634 that is actually fairly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203017_0203143 yeah local anyways yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203143_0203227 no that is easy
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203227_0203393 yeah would you make that that would be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203393_0203597 that is quite strong
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206489_0206636 well it is kind of insane
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206636_0206734 evet az önce
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206901_0207310 are we bothering with our topic stuff
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207310_0207511 or is that sort of like our own topic segment
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207511_0207760 like since we can not do the labeling and all the rest
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207760_0207915 we are still doing our topic segment
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207915_0208053 well we are setting you are doing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0208316_0209096 but we are not going to be doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they do not have labels
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209233_0209491 like all the label ones
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209491_0209673 you are off my level toons
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209673_0209740 i do not know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210577_0210642 i am just looking
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210642_0210701 yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210701_0210871 oh no it would be country four
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210871_0211092 if you are creating it it is all free
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218435_0218498 probably not
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218498_0218791 i mean just get work done
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218791_0218984 i think that is what i have got to do
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001099_0001453 are we no we are not allowed to get in the light so
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001887_0002029 unfortunately because of the
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002237_0002381 am i supposed to be standing up today

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008382_0009196 i am sarah the project manager and this is our first meeting
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009196_0009474 okay this is our agenda
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009568_0010193 we will do some stuff get to know each other a bit better feel more comfortable with each other

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0011762_0012154 now we are developing a remote control which you probably already know
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012154_0012699 rwyn mynd in ei wneud yn ymwneudol rhywbeth y bydd pobl ddim wedii ddod o

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0013201_0014283 but you know not a hunk of metal and user friendly grannies to kids maybe you can purchase should be able to use it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014283_0014958 okay first is the functional design this is where we all go off and do our individual work
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014958_0015940 beth syn angen iw bod yn cael ei ffurfio or product a beth sydd yn effeithio ar gyfer y product a sut maen mynd iw wneud hynny

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0016231_0016780 what we are thinking how it is going to go and then the detailed design how we are actually going to put it into practice and make it work
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017038_0017203 okay right
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017203_0018410 we are going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard i will go first and show us the characteristics of that animal

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061913_0062426 half of the selling price is taken up by building it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0062426_0062944 and profit aim is fifty million euros which is that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0063129_0063642 thank you yes um yeah i presume so
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0064913_0065029 everyone
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0065357_0066222 maen grwp hwyl ie dwi ddim yn credu bod ywn cas in bwysig am ddiforol ddyniadau a phethau fel hyn
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0066222_0066970 making that key point just that it is going to be an international market like australia america things like that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067520_0067829 what are your experiences with remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067829_0068347 i mean i have got we got we had three videos
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0068347_0069167 a tv and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069167_0069939 that you program each of your things into but that kept losing the signals so we would have to reprogram it every now and again
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069939_0070270 i think it was quite cheap as well
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070270_0070483 ond roedd hynnyn bwysig iawn y gallwch chi
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070596_0070891 you did not have six remote controllers sitting in front of you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073498_0073730 yeah that is the main stuff anyway
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073730_0075176 i mean and you do not want to i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0075743_0077073 when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions when you can do sound or options kind of recording
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077073_0077283 things like that inside it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077283_0077979 because it does not make when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at it is obvious what you are doing
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081235_0081365 what about the older generation
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081365_0081509 what about granny and granddad
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081615_0082363 my grandad can answer his mobile phone but he could not even dream of texting or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0082812_0083151 i do not think they tape things
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0084120_0084324 yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0086430_0087174 i do not know how i do not like the new phones that have got a windows based running system
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087295_0087683 i find it really confusing i kept getting lost in the first part
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087683_0088287 i have not got a new one but my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and i just kept getting masks
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0088438_0088517 that is just me
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0090577_0090750 i think that is a good option
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091369_0091737 i am bored by kind of a dual function
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091737_0092964 in that you have got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0092964_0093488 obvious symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0094848_0095316 i think that is a cost thing i do not know how much we are going to know about it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0095602_0095807 yes it has a little bit of a blue
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0097097_0097935 rwyn cael one point five o an o am y cyfle nesaf felly rydym yn mynd in mynd ir hynnyn bryd
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0098120_0098951 i think that is probably about it and then we will come back in layers again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102232_0102399 i would never probably
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102504_0102689 i mean the sky remote controls and everything
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102689_0103258 and they are kind of molded and look a bit different than the telus remote controllers are silver plastic
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103258_0103865 it looks a bit smarter so yeah i guess that is tough
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103865_0104156 okay so let us break it up there
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104313_0104416 so see you in half an hour

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063037_0063120 in our first year
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063810_0064823 you have got market range international and you did say earlier it is got to be accessible and usable by all age groups we are not focusing on business markets
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0064823_0065111 maen rhaid in ei wneud
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0065341_0065540 big target group yes yes
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071292_0071717 the experience has only been given the remote control with the object i buy
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071717_0072244 nid yn gwneud unrhyw tanffur gydar bach yn ymwneud âi iw gynnal i fideo a phideoau a phobl
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072244_0072768 but basically on off volume up and down channel one to that basic function
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072768_0073605 i do not think i could go any further with it than that so i suppose there is got to be something usable by someone like me as well yeah the main
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0075081_0075529 maen dda iawn fod yn dda i chi ddod yn dda
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0076852_0076898 she is

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078326_0078704 ond yw yn y telefon mobl gallwch chi gweithior llwybr ac maen rhoi menu
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078704_0079448 i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control like these so you have got a little lcd display
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0080380_0080592 with menus
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0082379_0082797 can he program his remote control or is he basic with that too
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083464_0083927 so that is the problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083927_0084464 that is going to be a problem anyway with the older generation
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0089871_0090564 is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0090564_0091178 maen dda in ddysglur ffosil ymlaen maen dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda in dda

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094012_0094353 you can have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094353_0094756 you can have a bigger screen in the flip over
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095678_0095860 it might have discussed
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095969_0096635 and there is no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone it can still be lightweight plastic you know

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0100524_0101484 so i think the whole design thing might be quite i mean you do not you can still have plastic and it would look quite good but

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029068_0029332 thank you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029332_0029602 
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031347_0031914 it is actually sitting it is not standing
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031914_0032186 okay i see it as one thing it is very supportive
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032413_0032773 it is your best friend in you you can talk to a dog it can be your best friend
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032773_0033136 it does not discriminate between you based on what you are
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0033136_0034096 second is loyal and third thing is intuition
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0034096_0035106 dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features i think belong to elora okay thank you

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0036433_0036784 okay
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0050178_0050267 right
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057676_0057871 i am not sure if that is the mic
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057871_0058150 one point four year old
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0061754_0061959 half
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0063639_0063710 um
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0069149_0069222 and the
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0070861_0071104 you want to integrate everything into one line
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0075518_0075806 when there is
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0078708_0078774 thank you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079289_0079360 little else
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079446_0080057 i was thinking of the same lines instead of having too many buttons and making it complicated for the user
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080057_0080603 maybe have an lcd display or something like that like a mobile with menus
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080603_0081203 and if it is somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone people might find it easier to browse in lvm also
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0081521_0081896 my granddad can answer his question
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0094604_0094666 good
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095091_0095738 you do not know how much we are gonna know about it it might save up a bit of space instead of looking bulky it might look small
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095738_0095924 but it might have its cost implications
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0104805_0104838 yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000818_0000982 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000982_0001080 it is green and black
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003704_0003883 alright
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003883_0003972 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0005545_0005586 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0006681_0007420 right bethany this is our second meeting and i might be a bit under the place
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0007420_0007886 right our agenda for today do you want us to give you a second
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008127_0008353 okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008593_0008870 i will go over what we decided last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0009263_0009912 we decided upon a universal control one handset for all two b videos
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0010181_0011216 that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers wide age range not limiting anyone
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0011216_0012023 we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product in our profession in electronics you know that kind of thing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0012023_0012947 our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget that we might
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013141_0013633 i have a bit of oh oh you can see okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013633_0014340 dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014485_0014869 roeddwn in mynd i weld a chlatiad a chlatiad ir castell
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014869_0015936 we discussed a flip open design reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming things like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016324_0016680 three presentations i have got written here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016866_0017062 should we hear from marketing post
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017503_0017732 no that is fine that is fine okay yeah okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017907_0017982 and have heat
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019400_0019512 mfn
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019596_0019726 action at home
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0033828_0033873 我
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0052766_0053017 thank you thank you very much
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053017_0053235 a oes gennych chi ddod or ddau
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053591_0053854 maybe we should start
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0059477_0059630 完
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0061274_0061355 okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077551_0077886 rwyn meddwl y byddwn yn gweithio am y ffordd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077886_0078435 okay so if anyone wants to write something down i will watch it until the end
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0078855_0079091 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0079260_0079339 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080268_0080336 ва ка ли
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080959_0081103 which i did
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084130_0084197 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084490_0084543 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0103869_0104058 right
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0104172_0104485 we have new project requirements
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0105110_0106034 we are not going to be using teletext part of the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106240_0106856 our control is only going to be for tv it is not going to be combined control
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106856_0107844 which limits all of the different things that it limits the cost for us but it also makes it easier to understand
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0108057_0109180 says for tv only so looks like it is just yeah i think maybe sky and things like that might be incorporated into it but
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109419_0109550 i do not know what do you think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109550_0109781 just that for tv only
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109781_0110213 i mean general tv controls do do video as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0110444_0110888 i mean you get combined tv and videos do not you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0112245_0112700 i think we assume it is still got cheyenne stop functions and programming
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0118844_0119020 yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120074_0120646 we do have a budget limitation that we can not control ourselves
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120646_0121783 so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing because it is something it needs to be the thing that you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0121865_0122367 used to find it needs to be something that you do not lose so you are listening whistling
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122367_0122886 maybe on the tv you could put like a pack on the tv or something so you can not see the remote
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122886_0123385 you go and press the button on top of the tv and it beeps yeah okay it is everything
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123385_0123711 something like that but that sounds a lot cheaper to me
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123800_0124766 the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0124766_0125253 so we want logo we want
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125490_0125856 ffasionaol ffysgol rwyn meddwl beth ywr ymwneud âr ymwneud âr ymwneud âr ymwneud âr
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125931_0126371 people paying more for it to look good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0126492_0126781 we need to focus on that as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132038_0132750 what about you were talking about the buttons the controls that are coming out now have kind of big
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132750_0133469 rubber buttons not tiny little big rubber buttons but what about i mean because we have got to make it original
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133620_0133736 what about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133869_0134201 you know with the touch screen computer
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0134432_0135394 so it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should not wear out as much either
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135518_0135840 you do not have to press it you just have to put your thumb onto it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135840_0137075 i think that might appeal i am thinking kind of japan thinking young office people trendy kind of thing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137206_0137531 but quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137531_0138564 easily labelled so that anyone can say oh yeah that is obvious what that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0140284_0140357 it is physical
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0145256_0146158 i think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146158_0146540 or they can make it bigger or they can change features slightly
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146796_0147715 it is going to be the same so we need to focus on just one thing not get bored going and lots of different possibilities
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0151286_0151974 or speech recognition which is extremely expensive i think that is the only way that you can avoid
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0152084_0152177 that kind of issue
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0154752_0155002 we are talking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155203_0155496 the type of company that we are working for as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155496_0156520 that they want it to be fashionable they want it to be trendy and you would not automatically associate that with the older generations
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0156520_0157418 now with the baby bird of ours the older generations are actually larger they have a greater population than us young people
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0157418_0157983 but i do not think we are focusing on that i think we are focusing on a sort of mid range
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0158124_0158361 o bryd ymddygiad
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160471_0160942 okay so the remote control functions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160942_0161612 we have got the tv we have got video
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0161750_0162392 i can not remember what it is called the little code at the end of program details video plus yes
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0162580_0163755 we could use that as an alternative to programming in times things like that i always found that really easy when i discovered it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0163884_0164486 because you have got your general record anyway so if there is a program on you want to put record on
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164486_0164979 that is fine but if you do want to tape something in two days time you are not sure if you are going to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164979_0165402 you put the number in and it is just a number it is not a date it is not time
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0165402_0165877 it is not channel it is not when it finishes it is not anything like that it is just number
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166423_0166641 you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166940_0167575 is after if you look in the newspaper or tv guide or any tv guide there is a five
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0167575_0169104 six digit number afterwards and that is the number you put in and it is recorded that it is going to be on on tuesdays at ten oclock on the seventeenth things like that so you do not have to worry about dates you do not have to worry about times
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169104_0169455 and it has been around for quite a long time
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169712_0170288 no it is not i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0172221_0172299 okay so
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0179443_0180041 the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there you are pressing this button and your tv is not doing it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0180125_0180592 taking your tv and your controller and saying look this is what i am doing it is not working what should i do
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181366_0181542 i think so
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181827_0181972 instruction manuals
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181972_0182307 but i mean there is customer service
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0182307_0183125 there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there is no call out charge
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0183125_0183634 there is no extra person has to walk to a shop on the high street
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0184469_0185430 but we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little variety and lots and lots of pages people are reading them
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185430_0185816 it does you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you search through it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185816_0186123 so that should be something to think about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186123_0186346 what other functions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186346_0186957 rwyn meddwl nid ywn siwr y byddwn yn angen ddeisior penderfyniad heddiw
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186957_0187714 ond rydym ni ar gael am oherwydd mae gennych chi ddilemau am oed y bataill dyna beth rydw in meddwl am
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0187714_0187922 what about phone batteries what kind of batteries are they
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0188854_0189772 maen mynd yn dda llawer o blynyddoedd ac os ydych chin gwybod y peth y gallwch chi ddod â phobl ddodol
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0189772_0190169 you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or at night or something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190169_0190674 but it does not really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time once it is charged
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190674_0191003 something like that should reduce
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0191820_0192107 yeah it could be on that yeah on that as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0192773_0192946 rwyn siarad y llwybr or ddau cyngor
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193074_0193261 so the recharge will be your
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193952_0194291 yes which is cheaper than the light one as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194291_0194770 the shape you have got trendy
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194770_0195498 i do not want a big box with lots of things you do not want a tiny sort of little thing either
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0195498_0196249 because then you have got the repetitive strain in general matter how much you try and make it simple
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0196609_0196676 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0197718_0197875 okay so we have got a flip screen
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0201381_0201563 you can move it to your hand anyway
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0202640_0203026 can you look into the company logo
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0203150_0204079 things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204079_0204130 i mean
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204322_0205260 for example if it was a c or something like that you could have it in a vague c shape that opens up kind of like a shell
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0205260_0205875 or something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0206040_0206644 obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that is there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0208341_0208598 well we need to think about how it is going to look different
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212165_0212769 or gallwch chi wneud ffasheau gwahanol fel y gallwch chi gael gyda phobl ffosil
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212769_0213100 you could have different kind of casings
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0213100_0213867 so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0216498_0216776 right i think we have to round it up
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0218236_0219067 that was in cutting down the number of functions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0219067_0219618 making it simpler so instead of having lots of things
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0220670_0221444 it kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel things like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221444_0221589 and doing it could be
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221657_0222602 yes it could be an advertisement feature rather than design feature you know draw attention to that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0222671_0223557 and also paid lip service in the instruction manual because it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0224964_0225675 we have got the buttons but i think we will work through that with the design of it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0226198_0226844 and we have talked about there being a long or something a bee pain for being lost
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227005_0227308 lleidior gweithdoriaeth y bydd yn ymwneud yn y ffordd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227308_0228085 but there are not going to be that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the instruction manual
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228085_0228384 i do not know if we deal with that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228594_0228670 i think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228984_0229266 ie a gwnaethon nhw or hyn sydd in ei wneud
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0229266_0229414 yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230012_0230375 i think you might get guidance but
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230550_0230564 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230717_0230976 instruction manuals because there tends to be a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0231160_0231851 demonised thing there everyone is got like a big pile of them but no one really uses them
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0232414_0232555 yes right

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0034157_0034256 i am just wondering
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0051715_0052358 that is a very important point that came up in our market research findings too so i will
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060486_0060728 the blood has not come out yet
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060904_0061000 thank you

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084171_0084387 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084563_0085725 in mynd i weld y gysylltiadaun gweithio ar gyfer cyfleoedd ymwneud âr cyfleoedd maer cyfleoedd sydd yn ymwneud âr cyfleoedd ywr ymwneud âr ymwneud âr ymwneud âr cyfleoedd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0085725_0086149 so that is where we started we used our usability lab
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086149_0086670 the company is usability lab we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086670_0087219 male and female all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observe them in the lab
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087219_0087626 just their general use of the remote control you can see we had one hundred subjects there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087633_0088097 our findings lots of findings i have just summarised some of them here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088097_0088814 the overall thing which i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088814_0089076 so it has obvious design implications there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089076_0089559 rwyn credu bod seventy five percent or gweithwyr yn credu bod ymwych ymweldau diwylliannol yn ymwych
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089695_0090332 eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy we were quite surprised by that finding
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0090332_0091220 but that is quite a high proportion of our international target we are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091790_0092588 fy enw gallwch weld ymlaen seventy five percent o fywyr yn zappu llawer felly mae gennych y cydnabod ychwanegol yn y chanel yn hoffi
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092588_0092783 felly yna cyfleoedd yma
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092792_0093454 fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons so again a big design issue there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0093454_0094252 a gallwn in mynd ir gwaith ar y cysylltiad os nad oes sofnodau yn ei gynhyrchu ar y gynhyrch ymlaen
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0094690_0095591 the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier remote controls are often lost in the room
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0095591_0096272 or cydnabod or ddwylo cychwyn fifty percent on nin ffwrdd o hynny
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0096272_0097238 thirty four percent of people take they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent sign of the buttons

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148224_0148581 i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148581_0148982 i think that is still a kind of question mark issue how we deal with that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148982_0149485 rsi tends to be caused by repetitive small movements

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158340_0158878 i am just thinking of budgetary issues too for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158878_0159335 want to you know not waste money not be profligate
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159538_0159772 in focus on where the idea will be taken up
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159772_0160276 first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0166569_0167039 i am not coming across that function but it sounds wonderful
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0167960_0168027 and it is
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0171461_0171636 excellent
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172320_0172808 can i just run this past you while it occurs to me i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0173473_0174307 that is kind of what led us on to comparing tv remote controls with their design features chain companies like carrefour warehouse
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174307_0174740 gallwch chi ddod yn unrhyw amser or ffon sydd wedii gael iw gael amdanoethau gydai gael ei wneud ac maen ei wneud yn ymwneud

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175078_0175985 is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175985_0176511 they know they can just pop into one of her high street outlets you know which button is it i press for this

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180470_0180828 i do not reckon what should i do if it was something as simple as you could not change a channel
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180828_0181323 but i mean if there were any more or we absolutely definite it is only going to be for tv and video
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0181323_0181622 i think so okay just a thought
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0184190_0184550 felly maen rhaid i ni ddod yn ystod y cyfle
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185334_0185586 maer bobl yn adael eu llywio
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185840_0186028 that should be something we think of
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196261_0196662 and we do not i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196662_0197058 brown things with the same coloured buttons all crowned and on the surface

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0208703_0209017 i think that sounds a really attractive idea

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209569_0209833 and it is nice to have you can make it lightweight plastic
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209833_0210338 nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210338_0210880 that is going to take care of some of the how to do strain injury try and prevent a lot of it i would think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210880_0211441 i think it is a really nice idea you can get even though we are using plastic
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0211441_0212121 you can still think of the designs you can get in plastic you can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213830_0213973 let us chance of it being lost too
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213973_0215162 it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is going to go down the sofa yeah people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament and they are not going to lose it so much
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0215162_0215553 it is easy to put nice to handle
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0216798_0217196 a allwn ddod yn gyfrifol y cyfle newydd ymlaen i fod yn dda i ddim yn gwybod rhywbeth
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0217196_0218132 there is no teletext it is only for tv and by implication video corporate image should be incorporated in their remote control something about video plus
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219412_0219960 felly roedd y cyfle hwn yn dda ar y reminder lcd am ddefnyddio video plus
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219960_0220091 i gyd yn edrych ar y gwaith
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0220232_0220665 neu a oes hynny nid oes i gyd âr gweithredu ymddygiad mae hynnyn un ffordd on ffyrdd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0221346_0221738 so it is doing it with the programming feature
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223519_0223739 and the rechargeable batteries
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223739_0224192 byddair unrhyw beth oherwydd yna y byddwn yn cyrraedd cyfrifoldeb
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225709_0225935 that is not at the moment a requirement it is something we are looking at
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225935_0226310 yes
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229455_0229731 what would you specifically like marketing to look at for the next meeting
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229731_0230004 or shall i just generally look at only a few
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232273_0232423 it is a bit of a shame
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232530_0232698 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017650_0017791 okay yeah i will go first
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017791_0017931 can i craft the name
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019155_0019224 this is in print
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019224_0019332 it is all perfect
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019684_0019789 mm
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0020998_0021062 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021250_0021849 this is the working design presented by me the industrial design which is driven there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021996_0022501 okay this is where i went with the match with pap once
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022501_0022885 yr un peth y byddwn yn ymwneud yw a ydym yn ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022885_0023358 a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change the state of the tv
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023358_0023844 whether that be the power or the channel or the volume
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023844_0024692 everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the tv or other appliances sending the signal to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0024903_0025738 felly roeddwn in dechrau i weld beth y bydd pobl eraill wedii deillio a allan i ddod o ffyrdd or hyn
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0025738_0026006 ond er mwyn i ni ddod yn ystod
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0026148_0027208 ideas from other people we want to make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it was not really my area because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027266_0027489 i am dealing with the inside really
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027489_0028055 so yeah i ran out of time so i can do this one as fun as it also
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0028055_0029482 ac roeddwn in gwybod bod y mwyaf or cyngor yn defnyddio rhan or cyngor iw gyrraedd iw gyrraedd ir tv yn ymgysg oherwydd y cysylltiadau o bethau fel y pethau syn gallu digwydd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029482_0029852 a dynnur cyfle ir cyfle
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029852_0030249 maer mwyaf or cyfle yn cael ei ddod or bacteri
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030249_0030387 now all one
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030387_0032173 dwin ddigwyddodd y byddwn yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032173_0032222 yes sure
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032558_0032617 and
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032617_0033253 if you look at mainstream ap controls they are quite chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033253_0033769 maen rhaid iw bod yn y gynllun hwn iw gysylltur bantrofiadau hynny
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033769_0034754 yeah well you can get the sort of circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the metric across
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0034754_0035461 ar hyn syn mynd ir pwynt nesaf am fod yn fwy fwyaf an bwysig i gael ymlaen
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0035461_0036032 yn hyn maer uniau yma yn fwy fwy ond roeddwn in meddwl efallai y gallwn ni weld rhywbeth yn fwy fwy
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036119_0036880 maer gweithredu sydd wedii gael ymlaen yn ymwneud âr bantreidd oherwydd yna ddim yn gallu gweithio
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036880_0037334 fel y dweud yma am y bethau y byddwn yn dechrau
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0037334_0039212 we can discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you are putting in from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal which we are going to use to send the information
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0039212_0040149 now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who is watching with tv unless they are in a cinema
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040149_0040724 but not most people do so as we are applying for the most audience that should be fine
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040724_0041786 and then i just had a quick look at the external design but i left that mostly to the interface designer
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0041918_0042276 and so this is what i had as the basic idea for what we want to do
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042276_0042828 it is not a proper circuit i am not sure if it will work or not
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042828_0043307 i am not even confident that that is the real way you would warrant it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0043307_0044180 so we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb the chip and the ui interface
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044335_0044440 which would basically
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044440_0045351 pan oeddwch chin gweithior beth maer cwp yn cyfrannun in ffordd ymlaen am ddata a allain gallu bod yn ddechrau or cyfrann ddau
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045351_0045881 which obviously means that we are going to have to conform to whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045992_0047240 i have a form of communication that the tv is are already using and since that is another reason to use infrared because that is what all tv is use at the moment
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047240_0047388 and then finally
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047388_0048772 rwyn mynd ir cyfle i ddwy o bobl o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o d

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051707_0051903 that is a very important point it came up in your
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0052171_0052865 alright okay and yeah that is what i came up with there
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0059548_0059679 function
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0060745_0061098 네 알겠습니다
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0078292_0078370 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0082660_0082831 okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0083072_0083098 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0084009_0084398 великолепно
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0109929_0110099 charles yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110365_0110586 а мне в пол уса фига
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110905_0111510 if you have got a sky box one of those sky plus boxes now
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0111510_0112232 you can record straight off the tv and you can say onto onto like the tv hard drive or something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0115583_0116633 maer bwysau yn dda iawn iw gweithio yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr bwysau yn ymwneud âr
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0116764_0116844 we also
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0117659_0117763 more for speech training
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0118863_0120080 ond yn y ffordd dwin meddwl oherwydd gallwch gael y cairau cyffredinol yma ach gwasyl a yna byddain gweithio o ddod o ddod i ddod i ddod i gyd felly rwyn meddwl bod hynnyn gallu bod yn fwy
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0130630_0131204 well yeah you could have a number of different designs i mean inside they would be essentially exactly the same
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0131327_0131716 the features could be same and the body could look better
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0134069_0134462 yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0135290_0135625 you do not have to press it
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138496_0138917 ond hefyd ergoenomiaeth fel y ddweud ywr gweithiaun anodd
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138917_0140603 ergonomics there is sort of physically different things because if you have ever seen the xbox they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the control was physically too big because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0140693_0142376 they are cut just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they can get around the controller which is so if you i do not know why because you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and small ones for others
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0150192_0151305 i was just thinking about how you can combat them because without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0151424_0151723 yeah in the speech room which is extremely expensive
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0154022_0154151 जेएफर्
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0162240_0162351 video plus
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0163198_0163315 is that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0164781_0164911 in two days time and you are not sure
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165687_0165894 anything like that it is just number
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165894_0166237 and you would not need a whole host of extra buttons for that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0166237_0166555 you have already got the numbers for today
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0167185_0167280 newspaper or tv
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0169347_0169912 it is been around for a long time it is just not very well advertised no it is not
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0170330_0171457 if you have got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the program once and it will record that program when it is on then you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171608_0171863 so yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171863_0172203 but just have that function would be really good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0177063_0179451 but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you sign for a contract so the companies who you deal with have actually they have got an obligation to help you out and also i mean it is fair enough to have some sort of help service but i am not sure how much the cost would be right
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181345_0181412 yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181639_0182014 i mean instruct instruction manuals
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0182540_0182649 very good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0184229_0184510 maen fwy fwy o funcwysau yn ymwneud â hynny
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0185403_0185487 it does
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0187956_0188561 ar cyhoedd yn ei wneud yn ymwneud â phobl ffynau
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0188561_0188987 but they come with a charger i mean you could bundle a charger
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0190909_0191734 yeah and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the blueprint i remember that could
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0191928_0192056 yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0192552_0192970 maen rhan o ddechrau cyfrifol
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0193338_0193963 ie ie maen ffyn a hefyd byddain rhaid iw ddod yn ystod or bach
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0053624_0053899 maybe we start
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059104_0059321 okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059321_0059379 i see you going
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060255_0060416 mm hmm
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060673_0060814 it is good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0061620_0062515 actually some of my points might overlap with what william just mentioned but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0062515_0063547 this took up valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think will take a feedback from the marketing because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0063691_0064255 i have not had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064255_0064919 so purpose as william already said i would put it to simplify the interaction with tv to make it as simple as possible
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064919_0065298 and to summarize i would say it should be user friendly by being easy to use
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0065404_0066192 rather than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering driven maybe having one hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066315_0066622 like volume control or channel changing the channel or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066741_0067462 but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it we will punch in these two features together
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067462_0067737 so what the concept is to have a flip top model
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067737_0069035 the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to say program their favorite channels or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069035_0069351 can be put in the middle part of the flip top
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069351_0070654 so it is like it could be accessed by a wide range of audience and we can punch in new features such as added features such as shop group body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0070826_0072814 findings most people prefer user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they have not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it is not of no use of punching in trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse a user
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0072814_0073649 as you saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of higher production like fifty million we said
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0073649_0074378 yeah with that i think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also so we can give him adding more features and make it less costly
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0074762_0075212 that is so this is if you ask me personally i would make a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0075447_0076762 flip top with trendy design and maybe we should look at also like the buttons whether they are like soft or little hard because there are times the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0076762_0076903 jadi overall simple
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077084_0077176 user friendly design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077302_0077469 any comments
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080345_0080468 to keep the sphere
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080544_0080661 you can not
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080727_0080950 you have to this can not be pulled
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081300_0081424 push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081928_0082028 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0083436_0083550 यादि मुझे जान्तो लेता हुँ ना
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0103476_0103651 mae hynnyn dda
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0112627_0113386 program anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0114090_0114129 ten percent
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0130021_0130539 so are we talking of a single model or maybe five   six designs
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0131349_0131665 the features could be same and the body could look better
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0142436_0143060 yeah maybe to as it was indicated the risk of repeated use
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143060_0143427 the injuries maybe your touch screen could be a better option for that yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143672_0144196 so you are dividing designs based on not only segments but also h two p is
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144196_0144633 here dividing it according to the countries also the market
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144633_0145286 maybe for us and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have small

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0154040_0154364 i would say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0183560_0184036 i think it is too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0184036_0184327 but for a remote he will just report it to the management
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0192253_0192616 so are we talking about the concept of rechargeable something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198282_0198846 what i was thinking of a design which nokia came up with almost six or seven years back
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198846_0199279 basically we have a flat one it looks like a box like a chocolate
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199279_0199946 that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they can move with something like this curved up
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199946_0200218 and you do not have to bend your thumb too much
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200218_0200588 so it is like a banana shaped kind of thing curled up in the boat
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200744_0201169 so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201249_0201901 so it is already curved up so we can have a molded according to your
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201997_0202359 the way you hold of it is kind of semicircle in the bottom something like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0202482_0202746 i want to see exactly the same as you do
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0206728_0206856 we could look in that way
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207096_0207273 what we were talking is to make it more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207410_0207989 rather than like c shirt logo could become you could put a logo in the corner of the model
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207989_0208367 rather than trying to make it like a sea shell
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0209025_0209098 thank you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0211055_0211171 yeah we feel a bit of a change
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215455_0215628 maybe we could commit some zip file
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215628_0216163 designs and then choose which are which will be the most common design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0216283_0216461 we can think of five six reasons
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0226542_0226773 they are being lost
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0229030_0229156 and different from what
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232357_0232411 ваши
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232559_0232680 okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232928_0232967 thank you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0000002_0000202 i will wait until you are all ready to hit that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0005239_0005447 i
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008008_0008387 welcome back everybody hope you had fun
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008544_0009352 right and this is our conceptual design meeting i think we are slightly ahead of ourselves
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0009477_0009969 from the last meeting yeah i was getting into the question i think yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0010104_0011160 this is where we talk about properties materials user interface and trend watching
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011269_0011501 so i think we have touched on a few things
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011664_0011891 to do that already but we will just go over it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012298_0012602 the minutes from last time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012602_0013372 we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0013372_0014280 it was not going to be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0014472_0016044 we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016044_0016539 we were thinking a shell but something along those lines just different shape from what is normal
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016897_0017210 you are going to look into the rechargeable batteries
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017331_0017939 and we are going to think about the port and alarm for getting it lost things like that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017939_0018862 and our market was going to be young business kind of range
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0018862_0019193 okay so should we start with the first presentation
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0019193_0019284 sim se você quiser
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0024946_0025060 espracık
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0035729_0035965 okay thank you very much
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036149_0036391 let us start from the inside and work our way out
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036755_0036949 yeah take a second
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0037104_0037309 yes thank you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0038856_0038972 i hate those little things
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0039096_0039596 especially if you do them on too tight and you can not get the courage on them to undo them
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0049745_0049886 to be honest people want
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050012_0050260 basically like wind up radio
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050494_0050799 how long can you get out of that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050799_0051223 i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053146_0053294 when when you have got fever
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053378_0053790 maen dda o iawn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053961_0054086 any any
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0055701_0055969 i am pretty sure the seller is from the sun
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056054_0056835 i do not think it counts electric lights but i mean not many you do not want to limit your market
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056835_0057300 i mean people who live in basement flats there is not that many people but there are people
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058059_0058272 but then it would be charging to the day
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058272_0058872 i think the point is it charges through the day and then you have got it charged
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0059540_0059632 yeah i think
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064002_0064729 but then if you think about watch it is on your wrist so it is on your whole body it is on your body the whole time yeah so you are walking around
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064729_0065014 you are doing things it is moving a lot of the time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065014_0065289 i mean you switch the tv on and you put it on the side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065289_0065588 then you pick it out to change it and then you put it on the side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065588_0065718 ومن ثم مجدداً
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0068177_0068398 so it is not to draw on it is it no no
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0069823_0069960 thank you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071616_0071774 expensive as well
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071774_0072311 expensive
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0074029_0074161 the side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075002_0075156 yeah frank
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075916_0076308 do not worry about it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080189_0080629 okay can we add in an attachment to clothing feature
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080799_0080978 can we think about that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080978_0081433 because if we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0081629_0081912 rwyn edrych yn ymwneud amdano
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082370_0082509 where am i
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082509_0084553 if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape the kinetic is something people do not do kind of we are doing something original and different but if you wore it if it is something you could just clip it in your pocket then you would have that less
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084553_0084817 you would not lose it so much
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084951_0085271 but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0085412_0085659 the eternal battle for control of the control
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0087163_0087235 okay right
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091816_0091988 what kind of things do we have to consider today
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091988_0092807 can we what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0111147_0111276 yn ddiddordeb
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117621 so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes off would be the rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0117621_0118084 like those pens that you get with the grip yeah that could be a good idea
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0118872_0119263 well that is been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0129140_0129293 o ywr ddarlantus
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131235_0131449 i think you forget to have a contrast between
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131449_0132237 it is the whole thing it is going to be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0132237_0132764 now how would you distinguish if you had it bare how would you distinguish where you had to press
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0134328_0134463 i am not sure if you can fill out but
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0135045_0135233 easy to replace as well
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137437_0137923 okay we will talk about that so if you finish your comeback to that yeah that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137923_0138131 that is the end
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144155_0144495 we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144866_0144989 well it is a remote control
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144989_0145772 you were sitting watching tv are you gonna want to sort of open it and say what you should do
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0145952_0146152 yeah i typed onto that i think
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0148283_0148597 very question asking
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0155824_0155938 which means
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0160946_0161428 can we swap that around so that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161564_0161743 if you think about holding it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161877_0162283 you would be using your thumbs to press just like a mobile phone
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0163533_0164442 maer lcd yn y ffordd ac yna gallwch iw llwybr hynny ir gwaith yna
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0164442_0165203 so you have the volume and the program and things like that on the lower side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0175745_0176007 dwi ddim yn gallu gweld beth ywr ddau ar ddau
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0176145_0176343 is that volume and channel
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0179203_0179843 i am not sure how long we have got left but we need to make a decision about
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180107_0180200 the things we discussed
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180270_0180650 so we agree on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180781_0180899 do we agree on the battery
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181306_0181831 that means that there is no function for the port
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181831_0182425 you know that it sits in then pressing button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182425_0182687 it is a gadget
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182807_0182892 point
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0184800_0184921 i think the only
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185031_0185833 i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost that means we have to cut down somewhere else
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185833_0186520 but i think pretty much we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0186520_0186655 lcd is not tuned
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0187652_0187765 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0188079_0188197 that would be good
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0189165_0189312 do you want like a backup
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191274_0191588 okay so i have got the battery
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191588_0192062 the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is not it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192189_0192592 so there is not really a decision to be made there
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192808_0193128 the buttons what did you give us as a
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0193474_0193716 the bare board lcd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0194471_0194948 on the top one okay you have got the touch yeah okay and then
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0195625_0195847 okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0197336_0197415 no it is fine
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0198156_0198256 good point
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0199200_0199392 i think so
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0200704_0201858 no i think we do not want to be tacky if we have got a kind of different shape anyway the fact the material that we would be using would be cheap
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0201858_0202008 so we could make it red
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202008_0202770 we could make it psychedelic we could make it black and white zebra stripes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202770_0203384 ond dyna nid ywr hyn rydym yn ffocwsio ar y peth y maen ffocwsio ar y peth y maen yw yw
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0203384_0203662 so i could just pick anything
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0205521_0206423 that is just different it is different it is just different from everything else and i mean i am trying to imagine clean looking houses
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0206423_0207105 sort of beige and black do you either want something that goes with that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207105_0207294 which is what is on the market anyway
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207294_0208360 or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0209428_0210011 and you would just have it across the board you would have so many different options that you could do
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0210011_0210708 you could have a plain black one you could have sparkly pink glittery ones
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0211630_0212456 and ones that have rubbery spikes you know you could just go so far with it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0212456_0213177 like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so i think that is quite a flexible
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0215226_0215710 okay we have got five minutes um well that might have been up for a while
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0222133_0222216 of you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0223557_0224476 wel maen nhwn ei wneud ond rwyn meddwl y gallwn maen un or bwysau ar y marn wel maen rwyn meddwl y gallwch chi ddatblygu hynny gydar adfiniad
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0224476_0225035 you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225035_0225419 obviously you will have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225419_0226057 the point is that it is got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does without that so i am not worried about that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0226877_0227640 depending on how depending on the expense of it i mean we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into so
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0227763_0228698 that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive and we would have to cut down somewhere else then it is worth thinking about
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0228698_0229151 i think we will find out more about cost afterwards
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229151_0229325 right i am going to wrap it up now
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229632_0230258 i have got an end meeting now
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0230519_0231255 so i think we have probably got it says closing we have forty minutes so i think we have probably got about that time before we come back
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231436_0231523 is either that or
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231623_0232110 thank you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0232570_0232677 is everyone happy
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0001757_0001913 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019124_0019210 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019333_0019451 just connect them
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0020110_0020144 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021791_0021898 thank you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021898_0022800 oherwydd rydym wedii ddeall ar ein ddarparu ac felly y ffyddiadau ar y ddarparu ywr bwyd i chin gweld or ffyrdd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0022936_0023239 the methods we use to decide on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023460_0023678 current trends and so on market trends
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023678_0024933 well we did our traditional our usual market research study with our hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most i am sorry i am slightly tongue tied after lunch
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0024933_0025119 it is for change
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025119_0025656 rydyn ni wedi deall am y rhan bwysig y gallain angen yn y ddau gwybodaeth ymlaen ac rydym yn mynd i hynny yn ddiweddar
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025656_0025849 so that was one of the first things we did
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025849_0026370 hefyd âr cyfansedd on ffordd iw gweithio mewn ffasiynau ir technoleg
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0026370_0026908 rydyn ni hefyd wedi gweld at ymddygiad ffasiwn ar gyfer ein cyngor ar ffasiwn ar adnodd ym mhlaen
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0027029_0028144 so the general findings from that was in market trends the most important aspects remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028144_0028599 yn y ffuncciwm gwaith ac adeiladaur gwaith ymlaen
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028599_0028955 maen hollol gwybodaeth in gwneud ymddygiadau technologol
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029089_0029420 and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029420_0029974 now i should point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel is the most important
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029974_0030639 that is twice as important as the second technologically inhibitor which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0030783_0031218 so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third it is still important
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031218_0031695 maen ddiddordeb o ddifornau ir gweithredu sydd wedii edrych arno
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031695_0032413 oherwydd y ffansiwn ar gyfer hyn syn mynd i ffyrdd personol ymlaen ir grwp hwn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0032413_0033086 rydyn nin cael gwybod or gysylltiadau or parasol ar melan syn cael eu hysgol yn ystod y ffasiwyr
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033086_0033505 maer ffrwyth ar llwybr yn ystod y teimau i ffwrdd llwybr ar gweithgwyr

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0068504_0069132 i could understand referring back to solar charging is that compatible with standard batteries
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069132_0069148 the new year
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069148_0069726 a allai pobl yn eu bod yn cael bateriaethau bach ond gallain ei wneud yn y ddau yn y cyfan or cyfrannog maer ddau pethau nid yn ymwneud âr cyfan
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0071449_0071648 identical
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0076735_0076799 the question is

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0081231_0081853 a allwn ni ddod o ddysgu am hynny cyn amdano
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0085715_0086369 it is not something that is come up in any of our focus groups and market research
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086484_0086645 to open the field
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086804_0087020 maen rhywbeth iw gynnig ar y llwybr
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115209_0115444 it does not come easy too if you let it fall

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133915_0134516 or we have inside like a small pointer thing yeah you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0135041_0135232 easy to replace as well
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0136802_0137175 they would not actually need one in the case of anything they have got could not they
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0137175_0137398 pencil pen

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0143138_0144102 is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display the operating room control display
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144533_0144638 i did look at myself
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144773_0144835 just a thought

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219094_0219334 so i should look at my voice
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219334_0219636 but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0221703_0221964 and incorporating the company logo
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0222656_0223061 ac roeddwn yn mynd ir ffyrdd or ffyrdd y byddwn yn ymwneud âr cyfnod

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0230669_0230756 it says
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0009601_0009826 yeah i was getting the impression
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0036429_0036582 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0038097_0038352 mm hmm
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0041188_0042252 maer bwysig ywr adnoddaur gwaith ac y gwasanaethau y gallwn ei ddylunio yn ystod y moment
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042252_0042507 felly ymlaen

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042742_0043948 maer idea hwnnwn ymwneud âr holl ffordd yw os ydych chin gweithio ar y ffyrdd maen rhaid i chi gysylltu pethau ar y tv ac rydym ni wedii bwyso ar y cyfnod nesaf maen rhaid i chi gysylltu
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0043948_0044473 hefyd yn y study hwn rydw i wedi gweld yn y cyfle or materiol
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0044473_0045055 oherwydd rhai or pethau a allwn nin edrych ar y ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur ddaur dd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045266_0045596 findings i have got my nice little picture there
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045596_0046596 maer chip yma yna ynar ta eleven thousand eight hundred thirty five ar hyn syn digwydd yn bob amser i bob gynllun ymlaen oherwydd maen cyfrannu cymorthau diwylliannol
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0046596_0047486 och gysylltu maen dda ir ffordd i gyd yn dda ir ffordd i gyd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd ir ffordd i
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047486_0047853 a yna rydym yn edrych ar y pethau ymchwil
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047986_0048454 mae nifer o gweithredu cyfrifol yn cael eu gynnig
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0048454_0049370 felly roeddwn in gweld y stannol ae a ae ae a oeddwn in credu bod yn dda iawn ir bach ar hyn o bryd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0049370_0050219 dynamo charging i thought that might be a bit silly to be honest it is basically like wind up radio
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050219_0050626 so you have lined up your remote control before you use it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050626_0050702 ونحن نتحدث عن هذا
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051215_0051688 yeah yeah i presume you would not have to wind it for very long
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051688_0052412 ond dwi ddim yn credu bod hynnyn bwysig pan dwin credu bod y ddau opsiwn ddiogelwch yn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0052412_0053316 fel y chadwr soba oherwydd maer rhai o bobl wedii ddod yn y rhan yn oed yn oed fel gallu eu gwneud pan oedd angen
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053691_0053742 is it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053742_0053910 alright
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055103_0055725 yeah it would the dynamo would take more space because you would actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055977_0056085 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0057514_0058039 maer mwyaf o bobl yn gweld tv yn y ddau yn y ddau
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0058725_0059062 ond dwin credu y bydd y peth ddar un yn y ffordd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059062_0059834 y chynethol syn cael ei gysylltu yn ymddangosion
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059834_0060386 i mean the amount of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would charge up
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0060386_0060805 dwi ddim yn credu bod chin mynd i weithio yn y ffordd iw gwneud yn dda
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0061351_0062662 maen cymryd mewn ir lles mwyaf ar lles yma yn ymwneud âr ffwrdd yma
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062662_0062874 because they use them quite frequently in watches
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062874_0064041 a dynar ddau o bryd dwi ddim yn gwneud yn ddiweddar am sut ynar ddau ond dwi wedi gweld un or ddau yn ei wneud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0064990_0065140 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0065538_0066039 yeah but then again i think it is because if you think about it the watch
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0066039_0067333 er enghraifft nid ywn unig aml maen maen bwysig iw gweithior holl dydd ac maen nhwn dweud ymlaen or ddau pan ddylair ddau ar y sîm
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067333_0067624 ac ir unrhyw rheswm
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067624_0068678 you are only using it for an incredibly short amount of time just to send a signal and then you are finished with it so it is not the draw on it is it no no i do not think the drawing would be
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0069582_0070774 ond maer ddau pethau nid yn cymdeithasol ie rwyn credu gallwch chi gael y pethau dylwyr ond y pethau gydar celau sona yw efallai ei gael yn y cas
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0070774_0071499 if you like on a calculator they are quite they are quite big and they all they all look identical
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0071725_0071915 expensive
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0072299_0073132 maer bachau normalol yn y bachaun bwysig rwyn meddwl bod ynar bachaun bwysig
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073243_0073799 rwyn credu ei fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i felly maen dda i fod yn dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly maen dda i felly
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073799_0074827 because if you drop stuff yeah if you have the size you would need to charge a remote it would not be that big but i mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0074990_0075189 i think yeah practically
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0075365_0076057 i mean calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0076239_0076697 ie maen nhwn gwybod maen nhwn cael pethau dylen ond maer bachaun bach
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077618_0077833 control like so yes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077962_0078479 yeah the this if you if you had something using the standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078600_0078967 ar bach
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078967_0079783 dwin meddwl y byddair ddaethau ar ddaethaun ddaethaun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethun ddaethu
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0079932_0080195 yeah i think you would
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087220_0087329 okay well i will move on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087485_0088899 yr un pethau a ddiddordeb rwyn meddwl ywr gweithwyr cyfrannol yn defnyddior bwrdd pcb silicon syn gweithio ar gael
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0088899_0089550 which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0089550_0091768 it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this led in a sequence of on and off bursts
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0092714_0093013 well the thing about it is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0093157_0094354 gallent fod yn dda fel ychwanegu neun dda fel ychwanegu chi eisiau eu bod yn dda oherwydd gallwch ddod or gweithgwyr yn y ffordd fel hynny maen dda fel ychwanegu fel hynny er mwyn cael ei gynnal yn y gwaith or nine butannau
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094354_0094603 if you see how thin the tracks are
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094603_0095211 gallwch eu hynnyn ymwneud yn ymwneud âu cyfan ac yn cael swyddin fwy fwyaf ar unrhyw un
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0095211_0096216 os ydych chi eisiau ond mae yna gafodd iw wneud fel hyn neu gallwch chi gael rhai
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096359_0096753 array switches which i will speak about in the next bit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096908_0097666 ac yna i ie i gysylltu bachio llyfr maer rhain yn ei ddod yn ystafellol er mwyn ei ddefnyddio
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0097666_0098463 ac roeddwn in meddwl am hynny oherwydd bod yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd y
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0098463_0099218 so you can see what all the buttons are i like on a mobile phone you do it more often than i do on an atv remote
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099218_0099999 but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i have that turned off
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099999_0100304 os ydym yn ddechrau i fynd ir botn i gyd yn llwyio
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0100491_0101417 maer materioedd ymddygiad y gallair ffactor yn ddod i ni
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0101417_0102327 maer plasig a dwin credu bod nin mynd iw gyrraedd ir unwaith yn y casau bwydol
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0102459_0103250 the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0103250_0104324 titanium very expensive just the process which to make it is expensive and rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0104324_0105188 well you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year so perhaps something made of rub up
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105188_0105650 ond roeddwn in meddwl yn fwy or botynau oherwydd y botynau y maen ei dweud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105785_0106024 that they have put across
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106153_0106991 ywr ymddiriedigion syn cael ei ddefnyddio yn unrhyw ffurfion anhygoel ac maen debyg bod yn anhygoel am rsi
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106991_0107867 dwin bwysig beth y byddain ei wneud oherwydd byddaich ddod och ddod yn byw yn ystod ymlaen
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0107867_0108482 ac y problem gydar casyn yw bod yna
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0108608_0109417 quite um there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109417_0109818 if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109818_0110496 ond os ydych chin mynd ir plasig gallen nhw fwy o gallen nhwn gallu gwneud ffaith or ffaith
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0110496_0110920 but whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0111136_0111242 to the flip side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112321_0112383 yeah i
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112823_0113240 ie yn titanium dwi ddimn credu bod yn cael ei gael at all
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113240_0113765 just it would well you could make it available in the titanium
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113765_0114170 maen bwysig in mynd ir cas newydd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0114170_0115100 because of the expense of how much titanium is it is light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115243_0115311 for my
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115672_0115851 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116388_0116511 rubber yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116863_0117008 and she can peel them off yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0119373_0120482 hefyd yn y ffordd ir gweithredu cyhoeddus or botn roedden nin planio gwneud rhyw ffordd o ddysgrifio
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0120482_0121957 now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare pcb circuit board and i am sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122071_0122465 os ydych chin cael eu cyfle ir hyn dyna unrhyw pwysig
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122465_0122835 ym mhob ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymneud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122835_0123831 ond roeddwn in credu bod y scren lcd or ffordd oherwydd un maen ddan ddaidd yn dda a dynnun gwybodaeth
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0123831_0124958 two you can have them in a sort of array and you could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing you could have them like a touch
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125432_0125558 uh what
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125910_0127015 o ar y sgrir lcd gallwch chin ffitio maer problem gydan ei fod yn dda felly gallwch chi ddod llawer o gyfranniaeth
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127015_0127827 but you would not have with the lcd you would have the wires coming off you would not have that with the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127940_0128210 with the lcd you would only have that with the printed circuit board
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0128504_0128659 also with the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129264_0129906 you can have a flat screen inside yeah but i am just wondering whether we want an lcd screen inside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129906_0130571 it would not be like full colour it would just be black and white but there would be touch buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0130571_0131188 felly nid oes yn bwysig i ni a gallwn ni gael bwstyns brub ywr materiw ywr anti rsr
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0131618_0131678 bro
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0132839_0133139 ie dwi ddim yn meddwl hynny
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134130_0134192 yeah you too
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134192_0135048 gallwch chi gael unrhyw styliad y gallwch chi ddod o ond rwyn credu bod nhwn gallu cael eu gael ychwanegol
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0136768_0136855 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0137738_0138096 yeah that is the end
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0138991_0139069 ja det är komplett
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139363_0139573 yeah yeah that would be fairly simple
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139573_0140740 rwyn meddwl byddwch chin gwybod two cyfrannu arall ond byddwch chin gweithio o ffyrdd neu ffyrdd o ffyrdd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0140740_0141112 because in the actual flip you would have some linking
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0146938_0147093 i mean you can not you could do it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147093_0147921 you could have a because if you just put the full charge through an lcd display it will completely blank it out
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147921_0148233 but i do not know if you can get any mirror effect on it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0156418_0156912 yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this lcd screen
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0163508_0163805 that is what i was just saying
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0174354_0174537 well yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182295_0182473 yeah i think i mean
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182707_0183573 maen ffyniad dda iawn iw gael a hefyd os ywn cael y gauau hyn yn gysylltiedig
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0183573_0184148 then it will not be cheap to remail without me it will be cheap so to remail without me
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184148_0184662 so do you reckon that is a good idea about where is the remote i am here bing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184662_0184793 i think that would be quite fun
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0186500_0187432 lcd ywn dweud ywn dweud maen dda iawn ir cyfle fel y byddain dda os oes cyffredinol oherwydd os oes gennym dda mae gennym dda
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0187432_0187668 and they use them in cankul like this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189054_0189228 what you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189926_0190502 nid maer cyntafau cyntafaun dod â bach y gallain mynd ir bach
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0190615_0190857 felly maen llawer fwyaf or ddau felly byddwn yn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0193636_0194134 yeah i think we are going for the lcd on the buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0194134_0194770 ar y ar y ar y rhan cyntaf y rhan cyntaf ok mae gennych chir tach
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0195004_0195515 on the bottom we are going to have the rubber ones the anti rsr ones
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0196178_0197020 yn y fflip y bwyd y bydd yn y lcd ar bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bwyd y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn y bydd yn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0198019_0198162 plastic yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0200605_0200649 thank you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0212137_0212251 you could just go
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0214132_0215132 yeah yeah with these rubber these rubberized okay not the actual uh plastic outside case just the rubber thing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0220154_0220323 oh yeah yeah the whistle one
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0226986_0227165 yeah depending on the expense of it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0227609_0227779 i have got him stalked
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0229935_0229994 did it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0008247_0008327 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0036430_0036499 yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054083_0054598 regarding the sizes which one you think will be like because we have to begin to consideration sizes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054598_0055216 so maybe standard aaa might take less space or dynamo might take more space yeah it would
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0060854_0061353 what is the life of the kinetic battery it runs for a long time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0064027_0064066 if you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0071528_0071765 expensive as well
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0072058_0072205 i presume the normal battery
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076724_0076992 and the question is like sorry
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076992_0077461 which one would last the longest because we do not want customers to be charging like a mobile phone everyday
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0077596_0077934 or remote control like so yes look at the light also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111124_0111763 second question is like mobile you can change the cover cover the skin or whatever
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111763_0112363 so in this case if you are looking at customer can change the color like from green parrot green to chili red or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0112363_0112923 is that feature available in titanium or it is only specific to plastic
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117608_0117718 like those pens
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117973_0118068 that could be a order
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0118192_0118395 it would be comfortable to hold on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125060_0125310 so i just want to explore the last part
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125566_0125997 just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0134989_0135328 it is easy to replace as much
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0135328_0136485 a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use and he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button like that
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0136485_0136741 if you keep punching with a point over
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138042_0138503 regarding the circuit since we are having a clip talk
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138503_0139147 we can customize the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and complex buttons on the other side
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0139147_0139304 so we can divide the circuit like this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148592_0148738 okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148998_0149237 i wanted to share something which i did here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149237_0149677 first thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149677_0150290 especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150290_0150802 second is we check into competitors the picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150802_0151570 so you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy they are both black and white
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0151570_0152116 so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152292_0152729 and second thing is there is too much of confusion here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152729_0152905 no particular remote is standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153118_0153286 like some some people have
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153441_0153591 here you see this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153591_0153741 this is on uh i
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153858_0154292 i found that only common feature is the channel control and the volume control
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154292_0154798 rest other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154928_0155214 okay and second has already discussed with william
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0155214_0156212 we are going to have maybe a gui interface in the middle of the flip top and graphic user interface basically which is what we do in computer
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156212_0156505 have icons or touchpad over to which is yes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156891_0157538 like you have icons or something it is a good example of gui graphic user interiors
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0157634_0157921 so basically a person in that point of click or
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158012_0158431 press any particular device he just has to click on that particular icon
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158431_0159281 and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means use of button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159281_0159776 so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent circle
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159878_0160312 so we are having a combination of both so on the simpler board
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0160312_0160780 on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164344_0164499 okay and you into the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164949_0165076 on the lower
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165076_0165165 no thanks
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165562_0165774 so the findings are too many clitoris buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165863_0166384 repetition of certain patterns which i have already explained in examples of volume and channel control buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166384_0166613 all are confusing and inconsistent
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166613_0166912 okay we had a little finding of voice recognition there was a main
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167049_0167557 which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167557_0168273 we have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0168273_0169125 but we had a response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169125_0169527 so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers i am here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169527_0170446 some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more trendy also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170446_0170664 and technologically innovative also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170898_0171243 so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0171623_0172153 my personal preferences would be like as already highlighted by the marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172153_0172555 they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172555_0173179 but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors red chili
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0173301_0174236 tomato red or whatever and second thing is certain standard buttons we should have
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0174609_0175151 i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0175151_0175720 so we will not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176016_0176429 this is the signal volume and channel
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176429_0177106 so keep that standardized because that is the most common feature across all models if you look at all the models it is here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0178082_0178157 voice recognition
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0181014_0181081 i am tired
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0187746_0187925 maybe we could start with the black and white
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0188073_0188307 that would be good yeah upgrade later on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197144_0197260 and further
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197709_0198266 for the body design i think plastic plastic yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0198266_0198782 for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0199172_0199264 i think
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0205544_0205727 it is just different
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0212288_0212491 like a
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213084_0213742 finally the body should be detachable maybe you can change the body or the case casing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213742_0214102 it should be molded with the design in such a way you can change it every time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0214919_0214966 eu não sei se eu vou poder fazer isso
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0218025_0218991 we are talking about voice recognition also because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate remote control if it is lost
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219083_0219306 so i should be looking at voice over
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219578_0219981 or maybe like william vissage string last thing some devices you put on keychains
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220136_0220425 oh yeah yeah the whistle one the whistle
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220425_0220813 so if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0222260_0222540 so i am really incorporating in the design
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0230257_0230355 a che cè la questione
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0232171_0232396 i think we are pretty going in a clear direction now
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0000368_0000686 if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0001995_0002074 success
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002393_0002526 and feet
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002738_0002856 okay your switch done
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003272_0003390 you are a bit too good
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003390_0003552 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003664_0003952 minutes we decided to use a kinetic charger
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004093_0004564 standard chip because it can come in various different sizes if it was not there
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004709_0004997 that is going to be a problem factor
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004997_0005194 we wanted a standby function
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005194_0005672 the case materials can be soft rubbery changeable
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005672_0006122 buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber according to the design
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006122_0006812 maer adroddiadaun bwysig yn ymddygiad â phwy yn ymddygiad âr holl
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006812_0007631 and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0007631_0008203 and the rubber buttons that we use will be anti rsi
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0008858_0009029 prototype presentation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0009260_0009381 i think that would be you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010325_0010586 do you want to hold it like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010901_0010995 yes yes you can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010995_0011086 i will be fair i will get it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012537_0012988 just one last thing and you can just take it off
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012988_0013135 안녕
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0014172_0014215 for
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0020953_0021050 and the buns
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0021493_0021601 oh right
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0023326_0023877 so put it in the top section rather than the bottom section because it is the top part that is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027237_0027350 i am so sorry
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027464_0027593 i like every two go
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0032909_0032972 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033289_0033662 actually no it would have to be on the front side
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033662_0033840 oh right yeah okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033980_0034152 that is when you have got to open it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0034235_0034335 yeah that makes sense
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0039904_0040303 but not interfering with the rights and the different product
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041343_0041510 thank you very much
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041653_0041912 wrapping it all up okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041912_0042199 i have now got evaluation criteria
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0042707_0043170 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0045226_0045415 it is quite similar to what it was before though
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0058297_0058533 just right smiling
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0060141_0060204 in the next
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0063692_0063765 i would agree
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0064951_0065004 i will see you tomorrow
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0069602_0069659 i do
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0072117_0072286 it is just two point five for that one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0075853_0076076 i would say it too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0076076_0076158 and feel too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077244_0077443 one point seven
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077443_0077562 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0087136_0087889 well the type of button that we are going to use in the bottom half the material minimises our science meant to
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088191_0088855 maybe because it is slightly with the size that we have got it is quite small but with the amount of stuff we are putting on it it is not that much
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088855_0089231 so maybe because there is more space it is not kind of moving around to an
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089313_0089572 okay accurately the buttons in between
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089572_0089900 it is quite obvious just big buttons
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0095822_0095902 understand
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096148_0096209 it would be
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096383_0096845 and if you did not hear it in the room you were standing in then you realised it was not in that room
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102140_0102218 i do not think so
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102431_0102558 that is it yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102558_0102627 i take it from the side
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0103784_0104040 too much apart from having a huge big
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105024_0105081 thanks
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105433_0105566 okay thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106383_0106722 okay i have got finance here now
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106722_0107058 i am going to flip this in so you can all see it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111261_0111373 now i presume
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111556_0111672 i am gonna scream a good night
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111791_0111963 that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0112668_0113201 we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113201_0113484 so i was still on for kinetic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113715_0113995 see it would have been handy to have this at the beginning
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113995_0114217 it might have influenced our choice
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0114509_0114789 right what is happening with the electronics
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0115794_0115886 oh no no no
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117120 oh right okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117520_0117628 so would you be too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117973_0118028 one two three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119130_0119210 one double curl
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119730_0119868 so what is a single care
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0120288_0120438 so just one double
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0121644_0122034 we have got plastic and rubber have not we
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0123290_0123329 do you think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0124483_0124648 we would be like saying we are using
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125074_0125261 see it says case material
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125385_0125843 so we are not actually using plastic in the case
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125843_0126008 it is including it is including
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0127840_0128124 okay we will just put it in we will put it in as half
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128357_0128636 we should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128938_0129220 we do not step on anyone is toes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129220_0129394 okay special color do we need that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129643_0129734 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138235_0138315 let us do this
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138315_0138673 oh no it is seven five it is changed
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0139863_0140057 it is not how he ended it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140280_0140355 okay there we go
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140434_0140639 y no hay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0141642_0141956 we have not been dealing with dollars there i think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142112_0142400 okay so the highest we have got is the electronics here
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142723_0142945 if we add the interface
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146296_0146349 worse than
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146444_0146567 most of us recognition
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146864_0146956 right okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147212_0147361 well the kinetic is three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147361_0147641 if we change it to batteries that is minus three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148023_0148079 all right
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148079_0148241 keep singing xion
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148868_0149309 we can do it some other way it does not have to be voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0149309_0150037 we could do the voice recognition for business class or something like an upgraded version
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0150037_0150218 you could choose to have them or not
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0151326_0151659 so she would just change it to high specification then
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154493_0154605 okay we can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154748_0155625 felly gwneud y pryd yn ymwneud âr gwaith a yna dweud os oes gennym nir gwaith byddwn wedi cael hynny oherwydd maen hefyd yn ymwneud âr gwaith
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0155625_0156026 they like their gadgets they like something that is completely different
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156026_0156347 it is some completely different associated review of company
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156347_0156467 right okay so
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157505_0157721 was it twelve point five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157721_0157907 no it is twelve point two five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158190_0158482 yeah well two twelve point two five times two
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158669_0158815 twenty five already
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0160463_0160841 the gender one was where the price was is not it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162262_0162338 twelve point five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162645_0162720 i am done people
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163089_0163418 so has that got us covered for the electronics then
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163418_0163680 we do not need something else to take that place
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0165733_0165921 all right so i have done that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166372_0166561 project evaluation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166692_0166948 we have done room for creativity have not we
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166948_0167513 because we have got decisions that we would have made that we were not did not feel able to make
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0167748_0167997 i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168536_0168736 in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168915_0169188 did you feel like a teen
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0169188_0169806 or did you feel like i would say it was tea i think it was coffee
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173184_0173296 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173296_0173446 how did you find it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0176832_0177869 i like the fact that we could say an idea and it would be suggested that there was not the best idea but no one fell like shot down
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0177869_0178399 it did not matter saying what you thought because if it was not something that was that relevant
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178399_0178669 and it did not matter because it was just another idea in the field
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178669_0178828 i do like that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179060_0179486 well you two created that wonderful specimen of a play doh model
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179596_0180250 that was the best part of the run i am still not caught up
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0180250_0180551 that is nothing to do with the teamwork at all
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181444_0181597 that was quite fun
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181597_0182055 and means whiteboard digital pens etc what does that mean
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0182055_0182133 ich würde jetzt
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0183562_0183667 had time to kind of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184151_0184614 yeah because we could just sort of say sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184614_0184842 rather than having to email you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184842_0184984 but it was nice having it there
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0185103_0185350 like the whole picture of the thing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0189996_0190296 yeah i think it is the idea
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191575_0191709 and yes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191709_0191888 well they have to come from somewhere
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192020_0192299 and as we sorry
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192299_0193197 and as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls remote controls no one is thought about it particularly
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193197_0193678 i mean they are slightly different so someone is been shot in the room and said my car is a bit different from everyone else is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193678_0194216 because it is something we should think about but obviously no one is put any great deal of thought into it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196176_0196984 but then when everything is really smart and you have just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table it does not go
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196984_0197713 i mean if you could have something that is a proper funky thing a funky item that is individual individual to you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0197713_0198494 i mean they could even go into you go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0198494_0199206 you would pay a lot extra because it is individually being a plastic was being made for you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199206_0199556 but people could have anything that they wanted
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199712_0199792 president of the united states
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0203973_0204308 well it is innovation for money is sake
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204308_0204544 forcing it onto people
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204806_0205290 and you can get you have got your hands at the works fine but you can not get the battery anymore for that type of phone
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205290_0205582 because the phones had moved on things like that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205778_0205904 that is very nice
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206223_0206361 in closing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206460_0206619 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206619_0207514 our costs are below budget with recommendations that the budget be increased
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0207514_0207752 i think that takes into account
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208156_0208471 like us being well paid kind of thing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208471_0208983 and the heating for the building do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209312_0209994 so it looks like it is going to be fifty percent profit you have still got all of the overheads to come out of that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209994_0210623 so maybe increasing it you would also have to increase the price that you sold it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0210623_0210881 i think but you were saying that is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213317_0213646 tissue
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213646_0213744 maybe i will do that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213744_0213984 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214271_0214736 the project has been evaluated well and truly
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214736_0215214 and you have got the meeting summary in question
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215214_0215890 so we have got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215890_0216450 so i will be delegating my role as project supervisor so good luck
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0216954_0217203 i think the celebration is the twenty fifth
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0217288_0217464 i hope we will be dancing on the dance
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0218479_0218677 and yeah just the last i think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219181_0219500 i think i have got minutes for two of the meetings
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219619_0219703 last thing you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0222167_0222225 i just got confused
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0001511_0001599 さあさまです
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0026214_0026708 and then yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0041713_0041806 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0042882_0042934 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0042934_0043055 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0045600_0046975 maer ystod or ymweldiaeth ywn i ni fel rhan iw ymweldiaeth os ydym wedi cael ymweldiaeth ymweldiaeth ar desyn ymweldiaeth ymweldiaeth syn cael y criteriaeth y byddwn yn cael on ymweldiaeth ymweldiaeth
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0046975_0047249 so this is the first stage of the evaluation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047249_0047547 now the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047547_0048158 oherwydd ymlaen am y gweithredu ar ffyrdd cyfrifiadau ymlaen yn y reportau ar strategaethau ymlaen in ymwneud ân syniad
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048158_0048619 felly maen ymwneud âr hyn a ddiddordeb yn y cyfle dda a ydym yn ymwneud âr hyn ar cyfle
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048836_0049116 now the findings that we came up with just to recap are here
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049116_0049991 maer cyfrifau y byddwn yn eich gwirio yn y gweithwyr ymddygiad ymwneudol ymwneudol technol yn dda in dda iw ddefnyddio
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049991_0050845 maen rhaid in cyrraedd y ffasfiadaur cyfan ac maer ddau bwydion bwysig ywr texture sbangy ar fwyaf ar lluniau ddaig
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0050845_0051764 maer ffaith y byddain gallu minimior rsi ai bod yn dda in edrych ac roeddwn yn dda in meddwl amser amser am ddefnyddio ymddygiad ddwyloedd
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0051764_0052317 maen dda in dweud bod y strategaeth ymchwilio ond yna hefyd yn y ffordd yw eich bod yn cael y gwaith oi gynhyrchu
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052504_0052880 okay so we can come back to that slide if you do not have a note of those
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052880_0053466 rwyn mynd i ddangos i chi sut y byddwn yn eu gweithion ffyddiadaun eu hunain i hynny i beth y byddwn yn ymwneud
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053466_0053913 we are going to use a seven point scale where one is true and seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053913_0054337 rydyn nin edrych ar y grwybodaeth y byddwn in gwybod y byddwn in edrych ar y slyd yn ôl
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054337_0054894 a byddwn yn gwneud y rhan or cyfrifiadau hynny ar y brif yma
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054894_0054982 is that simply
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054982_0055080 any questions there
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055241_0055377 so we are going to look at these
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055519_0056226 ie rydym yn mynd i ddysgur un a byddwn yn mynd ir gynllun cyfrifiadau ym mhob ir un ar lles
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056226_0056304 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056304_0056520 un ywn gwir un ywn ffwrdd
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056932_0057098 so i will not make children out again

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0059577_0060022 actually it might be an idea if we each did give our individual rating we could take it out at the end
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0060022_0060152 也好
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0060278_0060896 felly roeddwn in gysylltur adnoddau or bliwg ac os ydym yn ddod one two three four ydym yn gwybod ywr bwyd

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0191831_0191944 absolutely yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0196007_0196202 the dvd platinum video
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201108_0201817 i think this has been very market research based because just going back to mobile phones

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202851_0203137 there are innovations in that that people do not really want
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203137_0203687 mae pobl yn gweld bod y model or ffon yn hynod iawn ond maen nhwn gallu ei ddod yn unig maen ymwneud ir hyn or hyn or hyn

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0208960_0209296 i think it was just the production
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0210855_0211119 i think in the reading that we are given it is very specific

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0016555_0017582 this is underneath the rubberized outer casing which there would be sort of a wide choice they would be attached
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017582_0017838 but we can come up with it

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0018731_0020259 it is obviously in a sort of clamshell design and the top lcd screen you can see there would be sort of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020371_0020670 the black and white touch screen yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020670_0021549 maen ymwneud yn y cydnabod ac maer bandiau yn y gwybodaeth yn y ffordd iw lles
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021549_0021771 yeah

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0023993_0024362 rydyn nin deall bod y system dynol yn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024362_0024997 roedd yn dweud yn ymwneud âr e mail bod yn mynd yn ystod au bod yn dda i ddod or gwaith
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024997_0025272 felly rydyn nin gwybod bod hynnyn dda iawn ir cyfle
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025272_0025780 so you would have something like you would shout out where is the remote
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025911_0026127 it will shout back i am here or something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026345_0026723 and then yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026723_0026955 it will not shout out on here or something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026955_0027532 it was just a chat on him or something too similar
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0027532_0028157 yeah if it was getting there well that could be something for next time maybe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028157_0028476 you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028476_0029174 mae ymwneud y cyfrannur cyfrannun ymwneud âr tv yn ddefnyddior cyfrannur ymwneud â ni
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029174_0029767 it would have obviously because it is split over two different layers
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029767_0030462 it would need two separate pcb is that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0030462_0031657 and because obviously all tv is use this same infrared medium we would just be using the same thing to transmit the data
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031657_0031836 and the infrared
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031988_0032552 y cydnabod yma ar unrhyw ymlaen
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0032552_0032972 maen dda i chi
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033080_0033210 yeah yeah some of them
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033420_0033651 yeah on the front side
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033990_0034391 so when you have actually got to open it it will be facing the tv
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034391_0034801 ac yna yn ffordd y cydnabod
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034801_0035814 the top screen as we said would be an inset black and white lcd touch screen which would
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0035930_0037058 maer gwellau yma ir gwellau yma ond y scŵr yn ystod y botwm yn cael ei gynnal
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0037058_0038061 fel y volum y chanel y carrom ar nos a phethau ir effeith
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0038061_0039089 ac nawr rydym wedi deall ar y cydnabod gallwn efallai efallai gael rhan o ddwyll
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0039240_0039783 or logo arno neu rhywbeth or gweithio or logo ar y tŷ
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040004_0040229 no not actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040229_0040867 no not interfering with the whole look of the product when it is out on the thing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040867_0041709 and finally that is how we put the fashion back into electronics thank you very much
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0042881_0043105 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0060100_0060169 いや惜しいね
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0063870_0064567 yeah i would probably put it two yeah two or three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0064567_0064642 no three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066278_0066375 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066839_0066952 yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0068639_0068737 i would give it a one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0069005_0069175 no no not at all
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080119_0080264 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080340_0081046 nid maer ffaith yma yn lleid gyda plasfiol neu blaen
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0081046_0082045 but the changeable facias would allow you to get basically any one of the number of colours that you would want
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082154_0082482 yeah yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082589_0083208 no no that is the spongy fill would be in the rub that you put around it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083208_0083491 otherwise it is just sort of half plastic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083801_0083950 yeah i will go with one as well
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0087592_0087662 he minimizes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0090559_0090965 yeah i would go for a five actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0093454_0093931 yeah it was a voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0094276_0094535 yeah yeah that is yeah that is peaceful
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095126_0095345 i think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095602_0096244 i think it would probably be a standard it would be quite loud it would be
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0096244_0096449 and if you did not
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097153_0097308 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097680_0098250 i do realise that now you have got a family of bums too is not it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0102290_0102604 i think yeah that could that should meet yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0114834_0115187 regular chachipan print
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0115809_0115964 oh no no no the um
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116133_0116678 ie maen maen rhoi i ffyrdd i ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o ffyrdd o f
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116802_0117113 in the top it is the number oh right okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0117466_0117955 so would there be two just one rake
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118064_0118366 yeah one of them and one sample sensor and sample screen
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118818_0118949 ну и там уже
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119293_0119443 maen dda
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119850_0120257 in meddwl
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120464_0120574 one double curve
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120693_0121171 maer un yn ddaiddion ddaiddio
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0121776_0121846 classy
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0122318_0122413 maybe a bit blank or not
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0125714_0125931 no no that is it is including
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0126045_0126679 felly dyna ddim yn rhaid bod yn ymwneud â hynny oherwydd dyna ddim yn cymryd yn y cost or ffyrdd
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0128633_0128764 yeah okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0130421_0130825 yeah the push buttons one and lc display one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0131134_0131227 but
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0138203_0138312 it is a book
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139752_0139857 come on together
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139938_0140207 i knew you got to click off the capability
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0140518_0141065 you might be assuming that that is in euros
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141065_0141279 it could be in dollars
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141279_0141927 then we would be fine because the exchange rate we have not been dealing with dollars though
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0143648_0144016 yeah the standard it would make one difference
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144016_0144324 the biggest one would be taking away if you took away
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144543_0144579 it is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145099_0145444 if you take away his voice i do not know what to say
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145444_0145718 if you take away voice recognition then you have got it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146347_0146418 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146418_0146869 where is the voice recognition it is samples sensor samples speaker
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146869_0147206 right okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0147540_0148015 maen three
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150154_0150760 but they by me i do not see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150760_0151132 oherwydd roedd yn dweud eisiau bod yn ymwneud âr bwynt i ddod o amdano am y product
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0152684_0152856 rwyn dechrau
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0153005_0153128 yeah we can say
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154713_0154772 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154997_0155203 and then say we are in retina
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0156794_0157060 that is about it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157060_0157389 ja virkelig sygt vigtigt
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157389_0157688 is it twelve point five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0163776_0164224 because that was just a bolt on x ray you could just take that out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0164377_0164535 and we found
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0165505_0165598 so
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0169504_0169624 i would say it is tv
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0170117_0170307 find out
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173464_0173955 yeah no i thought it went really well
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173955_0174893 rwyn credu bod y bobl wedii ddod yn ddod ac maer pwyntiau sydd wedii ddod yn cael eu gysylltu
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0174893_0175366 though we did not quite make the voice recognition in there but that is good
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0175366_0176275 rwyn credu bod hynny wedi gwneud hynny yn y pryd ymlaen os oes angen os oes gennym nir ymarferthau cyn ymlaen ysgrifennur angen
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0176275_0176799 rwyn credu efallai byddain dod yn unrhyw ffordd
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0179518_0179601 thank you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182025_0182333 i think i discussed which one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182963_0183503 yeah i think we probably would have used the actual email system more had we actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0183706_0184183 oedd on bwysig ac os oeddwn yn ddifynu mwy
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0193972_0194451 no one is put any great deal of thought into it i do not think the companies are really concerned
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194451_0194929 they are just so we have got a dvd player does anyone remember the rowing control
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194929_0195222 can not you get the one that we used for the last one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195222_0195447 yeah just jazz it up a bit
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195447_0195953 they do not really think about it because normally the remote control is not the product which they are trying to ship
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195953_0196277 they are trying to ship the dvd but then when it ever
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0209117_0209327 i think that was just the physical
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0210588_0211064 but you were saying that that is quite i think in the remit that you were given it was fair
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0212327_0212444 yeah it will
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213821_0213994 it is all separate
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213994_0214279 it is a conspiracy going on
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0214279_0214376 i am sorry
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0216025_0216367 in my role as project supervisor

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055336_0055621 is it everybody is going to evaluate or just the workers
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0060095_0060228 yeah i see

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066756_0066816 yeah take care
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0069892_0070123 i am going to say anybody thought
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070123_0070298 the first one reading i am sorry
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070298_0070429 can you just make it two
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070543_0070603 god bless
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070603_0070757 yeah i just thought it that way
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070898_0070995 hehehe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0071117_0071242 yep i just got it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072069_0072130 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072878_0073085 ich habe hier so eine schöne fz
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080695_0080800 white bull
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080800_0080861 oh my god
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0082600_0082771 that is nice that is nice
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0083007_0083114 in the rough
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0093601_0093754 the voice
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0107878_0108004 you know me i have never unplugged that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0109655_0109698 that is all
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0115001_0115080 тихий рот проникает
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119093_0119208 sing one level care
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119371_0119432 still loves you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120299_0120367 so just one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120773_0120865 because one another
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122178_0122445 that is t equal to one and maybe a little point
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122756_0123099 i think since it is being used just as a casing we can put zero point five
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123349_0123443 yeah cause they are uh
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123549_0123800 i think it allows the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123800_0123894 you can use that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124252_0124459 means we are not using a lot of rubber actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124459_0124535 it would be like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124679_0124956 a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0130211_0130272 push button
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137174_0137358 i think you could change the battery also
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137358_0137594 so we are going for kinetic how we are going for a standard battery
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139161_0139263 and good flat
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139789_0139960 come on together
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141567_0141760 we have not been doing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141989_0142114 i think it is in yirung
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0143373_0143511 so i think this is doctor patrick
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144422_0144689 what i feel is customers never said anything about the battery
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144689_0144939 it is internal nobody looks into the battery
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144939_0145209 but shape and color
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0145866_0146022 with that special flow
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0146133_0146305 a allwn ni weld beth ywr ffyrdd yn ystod
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0151558_0151753 in our recreation
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157223_0157350 या वेखलुत से लगचा
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157501_0157589 was it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0158800_0158933 i am going to quibble about it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160150_0160473 i do not know but fifty percent is the cost
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160473_0160647 gender one was
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0161295_0161388 what is a first for you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0162472_0162610 okay
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165317_0165375 seems fine
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165580_0165807 excerpt from the mission everything
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0169703_0169821 i would be too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171331_0171714 yeah i think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171714_0172027 it is not like people trying to cut each other
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172027_0172218 it is more of a cohesive teamwork
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172218_0172557 we came to a pretty creative design
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172672_0172761 i do not know
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172892_0172964 yeah i think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172964_0173137 and sir you coordinated the work very well
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0179596_0179920 that was the best part of that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185416_0185717 yeah i did not like moving around the room
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185717_0186263 i think it is good like we spend time individually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0189474_0189743 anyone thought of remote control with a flip top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191020_0191204 that is mine
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191664_0191739 yes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192004_0192079 with an asher
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192175_0192251 so yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0199681_0200613 surprisingly people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every month you see a new launch or something like that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0200613_0201118 and new television products coming up but nobody giving much idea to this
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0201118_0201302 i think it should be good that this has been
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0210559_0210707 maybe if you were standing
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0213665_0213719 video
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0215140_0215234 ich liebe meinen kuchen
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0216751_0216948 celebration we did not talk about that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005586_0005769 okay are you ready i think so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005769_0006085 i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006200_0006547 and his name and what your function is
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006547_0006729 so maybe
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0008798_0008859 and your name is
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010788_0010851 very good
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010851_0011071 and as you already know i am betsy
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011071_0011307 i am the project manager for today
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011307_0011817 so why do not we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012134_0012611 yes opening acquaintance tool training
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012611_0013238 the tools i think we already i guess the tool is really out of the computer as far as i can see
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013287_0013804 each of us will get instructions and we will take it from there
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013804_0014097 project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014097_0014616 i do not think we have any great discussion at this point
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014944_0015168 here is what this thing should be
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015168_0015754 this thing we are going to design is a new remote control
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015754_0016232 should be original trendy and of course use of failure
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0016519_0016699 so maybe you will make some notes of that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019638_0019744 all right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019744_0020164 here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0020378_0021157 that is it is going to be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021157_0021820 the same goes for the conceptual design there will be individual work and then discussion afterwards
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021944_0022212 detail design same thing basically
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0024394_0024545 i can not try this
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025468_0025736 okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025736_0025774 all right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026002_0026470 then tool training try out the whiteboard person can draw their favorite animal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026470_0026872 does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026872_0027252 so that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027468_0027612 you want to go eileen
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027758_0027986 whether you are without hanging yourself
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0028810_0029082 and remember you have to press so it works
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0030752_0031064 that is a fat cat
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032052_0032258 and you are francine right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032258_0032750 would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033022_0033083 잘 자요
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033083_0033153 oh that is okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033357_0033549 i did not get to that late
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0036725_0037272 is a project finance which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037272_0037593 selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037725_0038609 profit aim for the company is fifty million euro the market range unlimited meaning international
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0038740_0039364 and production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0040381_0041267 so these are all things of course to remember is a budget and when you design to materials cost etcetera
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0041916_0042758 now the discussion i guess is does any one of you have experience with remote control
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0042895_0043324 we use them right every day
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043324_0043499 and
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043656_0044399 now having used the remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did not like with it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0044399_0044923 things you would like to change things you would like to improve with this thing any first ideas
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0045037_0046058 do you like it to be smaller bigger have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons you know things like that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0046515_0046621 small right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0048672_0049526 so it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines basically
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051311_0051812 it should be something new it should do something different than just what we have
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051812_0052107 now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052422_0052829 like trendy you know like earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052829_0053345 different colors or materials or shapes also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0053345_0053873 so yeah shapes right you know like kidney shaped first in your hand or something you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055123_0055827 that is true because they put the newspaper or they put it behind a plant or whatever
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055827_0056564 and suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the tv off and say what the hell is my remote control yeah
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0056614_0057317 or if it is really in a dark spot that it keeps out a sound or a signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057471_0057593 so if lost like
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057674_0058145 if lost signal throw signal you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058567_0058790 exactly i mean just that is why i say
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058790_0059260 i am just saying throw signal meaning just whether it is a beam or light or a beam
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060567_0060957 okay my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060957_0061646 in other words if it is like in a dark spot meaning you know like your newspaper is on top
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0061646_0062032 sweater is on top or it is behind a plant
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062032_0062575 at that moment it is like light sensors
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062575_0063003 in that moment it has a sensor it gets a certain darkness
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063003_0063476 it has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063476_0063721 i mean that we can discuss that later you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064129_0064224 that is right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064224_0065078 you know it would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and i think voice or clapping that is not specific enough
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0065078_0065848 i know they are the lamps and stuff you know you can clap on and off but i think they only work to a certain degree
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066408_0066480 what goes with it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066770_0067159 oh yeah well but then those people we can not help everybody
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0067808_0068395 maybe we have to move along yeah we have to move along but i think we have some good points to start with here
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068584_0068849 okay the next beating will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068849_0069212 i think you will did you get the notices on your computer for this
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069212_0069545 okay so you got the notice
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069545_0070163 the working design i guess that is the function id who is this
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070163_0070398 industrial designer that is you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070746_0071113 so we are looking for a working design when we come back
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0071572_0072011 and then the technical function you had a technical function so you were the working design
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072011_0072439 so you have the working design and then a functional design
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072439_0073430 and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in general
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073430_0073594 that would be your idea
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073594_0073824 and of course price
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073824_0074169 that is it that is it but the price is a good price
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074169_0074465 i mean the price is given but that was
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074633_0074679 that is right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074944_0075008 that is right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075138_0075610 and you will get specific instructions for that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075610_0075784 i think that is the end of the show
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0076472_0077087 so we have time two three minutes
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077087_0077357 any questions at this point
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077357_0077595 or suggestions
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077780_0078716 i think basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions i guess you can
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0079796_0080194 then we see you in about thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0080194_0080361 and see what we can come up with
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009185_0009269 i am janvi

AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0007661_0008083 and my role is to design a television remote control
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032223_0032416 yes i am passionate
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032416_0032508 yiyemiş ya

AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033747_0033963 i should not
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0034799_0034978 i agree with rassley
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0035586_0035895 okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0045394_0045442 i have more
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046146_0046571 yes i feel that all the remote should be very compact small
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046571_0046979 those which we get here nowadays it is very long
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046979_0047276 and it should have multi purpose
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047276_0047914 like the remote control which we use for tv it should be used for some other purpose also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047914_0048673 like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating system
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0048848_0048946 yes
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052105_0052326 yeah design should be yeah it should be different
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052326_0052544 all the almost all like trend you know like
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052790_0052882 thank you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0053067_0053246 sheep also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057312_0057325 you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057704_0057778 lost
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057858_0058016 signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0063866_0063918 and
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0066540_0066638 because you are
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0005725_0005770 i think so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0006154_0006257 that is a good one
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008339_0008533 and i am a marketing person
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008533_0008694 i want to figure out how to sell them
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008882_0008969 my name is aileen
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022046_0022155 same thing
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022276_0022645 different types of design that we are going to be concerned with
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0023611_0023838 conception conception
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024101_0024250 thank you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024812_0025104 maybe we should redesign it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0025279_0025469 after we finish the remote control we will get to that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027623_0027852 okay i will see what i can do whether you are
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027852_0027889 to be
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0028008_0028551 see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029006_0029219 so it is
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029219_0029775 음 음
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0030798_0031573 i am very sorry
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0031573_0031812 and it likes to sit like that okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0032877_0033282 am i supposed to wipe off that no no no that is okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035732_0035806 wow
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035999_0036482 the kitty cat is hungry so i do not like sweets
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0039523_0039851 okay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0040286_0040648 so these are all things of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0049614_0050276 twelve fifty euros per
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050378_0050675 you know so we get a really good site and maybe we can do that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050780_0051357 we certainly can try to i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things it should be
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0051736_0051776 yeah
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0053853_0054232 that is in friendly shape yeah that would help
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0054232_0055025 i think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0055025_0055113 and they can not find it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0056602_0056712 well or yeah or you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0057264_0057676 so if lost light should blink
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0058039_0058091 signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0059225_0060571 i think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what should you have to do to make it beep or blink
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0062554_0062623 in that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0063909_0064125 so the light sensor would activate the signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0065819_0066177 it could be some place really obvious and you still would not be able to find it
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066522_0066689 because you are silly
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066689_0066793 because people are so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066866_0067777 and those people they can not help everybody like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0067777_0067999 you know maybe we have to move along
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0074525_0074986 we have to justify that by having sufficient features to make it sell at that that is right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0078758_0079163 i think i will have to think about it for our next meeting
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079163_0079283 how about you people
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079650_0079774 alright well
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0080380_0080453 okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0003732_0003865 okay so you are ready
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0004717_0005869 i take it you all have received instructions as to what we were supposed to do yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0006079_0006733 i think the marketing manager should go first addressing the needs and desires
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0007843_0007903 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0009559_0009705 you know participate in
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010096_0010373 okay can we face him
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010629_0010753 okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034130_0034686 one other appliance or maybe a lamp can i interject something
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034686_0035355 we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0035355_0036262 the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext because that is sort of outdated okay it is the internet
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0036262_0037062 and according to higher management it should only control the tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0037062_0038107 mostly because they feel that it is too complex a task to include other things and they are concerned with the time to market
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0038285_0039112 and the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039112_0039508 and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039508_0040221 so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040221_0040704 and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who has been this way
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040704_0041353 so i just wanted to check this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the things we want to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041353_0041995 these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things so it is only going to be tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041995_0042510 but the one thing maybe that could be an enigmatic satelitex idea
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0042638_0042729 all right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056303_0056460 and uh
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056599_0057157 who would be next i guess that would be you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0057229_0057449 you want me to do get yours yeah sure
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058082_0058319 is your number three number two
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058319_0058366 namaste
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060454_0060526 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060798_0060871 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0071692_0072250 that is already been eliminated by management
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0083585_0084194 i think it is possible yeah well that is a good point
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0085700_0085744 good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086748 it just built it basically yeah yeah it is just
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086928_0087468 there is a budget we are looking at if you build one wall that is going to make a big difference whether it is going to be square or
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088357_0088405 oh yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088531_0089146 i think we will have to look at the budget on that but i think in principle that would be kind of fun
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089146_0089183 because we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089549_0089661 silly food silly
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089733_0089875 like a net home nation
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096671_0096935 a little elderly a little arthritic you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096935_0097875 and it is a small button and they do not press it exactly you know something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they are very frustrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0100099_0100191 get to that with you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102284_0102486 because the clock would be really fast
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102808_0103154 you see i am already a korean
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0108556_0108634 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0111613_0111738 shoulder yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0115161_0115274 oh we do not have to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0117944_0117979 this one
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0119741_0119918 thanks
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120040_0120160 yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120306_0120341 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0121071_0121245 would you want it close to me
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0127901_0128111 on the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0128111_0128168 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0130485_0130598 upset in a
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0149375_0149515 timer yeah timer
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0150288_0150602 okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0153384_0154275 on my slideshow basically we have already done the agenda and on the closing basically there will be lunch break and all that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0154275_0155070 however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155070_0155734 and what function working design how does it work
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155734_0156064 so these are the two things we should come up with
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0156064_0156654 so the first thing is maybe a little easier on the who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157093_0157263 i guess in many ways everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157448_0157621 everybody who has a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157798_0158314 yeah and i think today there are probably not many people who do not have a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158314_0158496 there are a few but in general no
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158673_0159520 now talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody but i think within the target group we have subgroups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0159520_0160519 we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160519_0160975 so i think that is one group that is certainly important
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160975_0161845 then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0161845_0162455 and i do not know how much we want to cater to children is use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0162455_0163223 i mean that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163447_0163714 so these are just some thoughts i have on it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163714_0165367 and i do not know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are going to design this one thing or whether we are looking at what we like we are talking about different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0165367_0166225 whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0167876_0168847 a lot of marketing pull that has a lot of appeal but i think i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0168847_0169322 i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors that is right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0169322_0170178 you know like you make it nice and pink fluorescent banana color or whatever you make a banana shape one yeah for example you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170178_0170467 but the question is really who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170623_0170867 do we look at one target group
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170984_0172090 and with the twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have a mess with the technical people here whether to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0172297_0172966 so the subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0173074_0173490 out of the cost we are supposed to respect
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0175538_0175628 with
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0176298_0176399 well that is the family
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0179785_0180380 the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0180380_0181272 and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know within the target group or subgroups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0181272_0182218 the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182218_0182431 i mean the basic design that you understand will be the same
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182431_0183428 but the question is how much will that set us back if let us say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0183533_0184353 so that remains to be seen but the charge group as a whole is basically everybody who is a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0185553_0185747 yeah well that is the question
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0186847_0187426 well maybe there is an idea you know for example new portable phones
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187426_0187816 they have removable plastic cases
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187816_0188477 so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0188477_0190040 that in each package you have for example you have let us say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another color or stripe whatever that already comes in a package
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190040_0190371 and then if people really want more colors they can buy it separately
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190507_0190650 you know mobile phones yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190927_0190982 that is right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190982_0191694 but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe whatever they have as another one in the package
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0191694_0192696 and they can go to the store for a few francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it for example
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0194549_0196111 well i think the idea here is to design one remote and the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0196111_0197066 having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197287_0197556 five minutes i guess that is the old message
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197828_0197944 finish making them
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197944_0198241 um
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0198892_0199452 but i think we do some more research i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0199452_0200023 if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200145_0200247 so we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200474_0201028 do we agree on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201207_0201447 so now i understand it is lunch break
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201548_0201631 and um
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201778_0201922 so that is what we will do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202220_0202324 so thank you very much
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202439_0202690 and we will see you after lunch
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0011039_0011117 free
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0026483_0026554 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0037439_0037582 risk to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057119_0057188 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057335_0057454 是
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057454_0057498 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0058247_0058379 number two number two
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059092_0059158 thanks
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059376_0059594 can you see the screen
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059841_0060125 no patsieka
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060245_0060521 przybijaj
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060521_0060592 tongue tongue
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060771_0060994 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060994_0061373 i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061373_0061644 can i go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061832_0062592 the method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0062592_0063941 it takes the power from a battery say a battery it can not be an electric supply like you have to like switch connect your remote controller to a power supply from the electricity or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0063941_0066293 it should be a battery because remote control should be like you should take it to wherever you want and then this integrated circuit it takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into infrared bits and it sends it to the device
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066293_0066601 like a tv or air conditioner something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066643_0067027 a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0067027_0068629 if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0068629_0070147 it should recognize the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote remote controller will send a send a signal
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070147_0070757 and the tv it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070757_0071600 change the volume control and so i think it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0071851_0071905 management
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0072628_0073653 so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073653_0073867 so you can control whatever you want
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073867_0076040 you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the tv or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and tv can perform the actions
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076111_0076315 so can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076382_0077721 i just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller i think these are the very simple features and they do not take much of the investment also
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0077721_0079412 it is like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0079506_0081211 and there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that this is not an action
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081211_0081515 there can be no action taken to that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081515_0081690 and there should be a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081690_0083182 like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can not be like if you have kids and all then they will be playing with remote controllers so you can lock the remote controller
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0083182_0084080 make it usable for more than one device it is a it is hard but it is possible yeah so that is so that is a question
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084080_0084245 yeah viewpoint you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084245_0085364 and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and that is good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0085488_0085806 fun and colors also
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086009_0086577 no no no i do not think it will be like you can have you know for if you want it just build that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086627_0086683 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086683_0086926 it is just shapes it does not matter
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088300_0088570 yeah that is a different principle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088713_0088792 yeah the budget on
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089120_0089205 because we had
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089635_0089884 for children like an animation
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089884_0090028 yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090210_0090371 ha ha ha
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090440_0091106 and the buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091106_0091392 if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091392_0091748 if you have less features then your remote controller will not be attractive
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091748_0092561 so i think we need to make some buttons which are intended for two or three operations
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0092561_0093299 like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press the other button in another mode it will change the color
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0093299_0093901 so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0094196_0094311 with user interface
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0095879_0096045 it is like you and i
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0096256_0096337 time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0097647_0097780 anything else that they have ever
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0098176_0098450 you do not feel the mood change
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099002_0099208 shapes and so the features are like
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099208_0099290 a triangle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100079_0100646 but we will get to that with you and also text should be very clear so that there will not be any ambiguities that is right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100706_0100788 that is a good point
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100893_0102201 and display clock if you want more features then we can display clock it i do not think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit yeah that is that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102313_0102440 because the clock could be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102753_0103119 you are sitting on the radio
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0103811_0104056 can you go to the next
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104056_0104880 components the main components may need for it like buttons and underneath that there should be switch
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104880_0105030 and bulbs
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105030_0105851 like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating the remote controller or whenever the tv is on suppose
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105851_0106265 then the remote controller should automatically have a light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106384_0106796 then it will be like if you switch on your tv through another source
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106796_0107456 not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107456_0107578 maybe we can house that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107578_0107880 whenever the tv is on the remote controller will have a light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108020_0108277 and then inflow red bugs
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108277_0108576 this is later when it is done yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108668_0109143 and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109143_0109521 which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109521_0110074 and voice connecting all chips which is lights every game so there should be wires
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110167_0110652 and of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110652_0111183 you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to give us shame
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0111509_0111579 holder
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112017_0112192 and i will go into the studio
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112286_0112464 next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112611_0113850 i have referred the site the home page of our website from where i got few points
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0114021_0114147 that is it that is it from me now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115275_0115370 it is not like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115370_0116172 i have referred the page to get new ideas of what can be the working design how it works and all
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116450_0116514 if you want
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116568_0116646 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0117636_0117926 it is actually there on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137491_0137642 нет
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137642_0137890 if there is a clock then there can be an alarm clock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0149124_0149678 later and use it okay it is like a timer
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0157482_0157685 who has a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0158170_0158348 do not have a tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0175767_0176417 can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know well that is family in a
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0176666_0176809 and a middle lisp
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177578_0177728 yeah of course that we can do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177728_0179020 but specifically if elderly people want big buttons then you can not really make a big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big remote controller for elderly and for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179020_0179123 what about the electronics
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179295_0179446 it does not cost
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179728_0179872 does not
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186614_0186661 here is the
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186661_0186947 industrial i do not think so
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186947_0187015 there is an sb
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0190462_0191133 like you know mobile phones we have different you know covers that is right but like if then everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0194588_0194668 i think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198668_0198931 maybe
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198931_0199144 i think we do some more research
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200029_0200753 seventy percent is a unique do we agree on that in principle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200825_0200991 whether we will be able to do that on
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0202280_0202326 thank you very much
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0026925_0026998 somebody take a
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0027570_0027685 silver sizzle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0071586_0071643 to prove
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0085727_0085777 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0086714_0086806 you know it is just us
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0089813_0089969 do not ruin it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0097699_0097754 i will set the table
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0102334_0102375 because
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111068_0111184 i am just giving you a remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111410_0111519 please hold on
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111519_0111649 hold the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0119903_0119972 to spend
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0120208_0120273 no no i am three
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121036_0121146 what do you want it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121146_0121371 yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121442_0122422 as a user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122422_0122697 can you please go on to the next slide
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122697_0123822 so i found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0123988_0124081 now for that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0124081_0125332 a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the tv and it can control the functionalities different functionalities of the tv
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0125332_0126793 there should be a signal something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0126978_0127965 now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user choice
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128388_0128951 if you want to view a particular program at say nine oclock he can set the time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128951_0129389 and the tv will automatically switch on at that particular time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0129389_0130658 so he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child log system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular child at a certain age
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0130658_0131316 then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0131316_0132153 and one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0132383_0133347 the remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the tv television
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0133347_0134209 and this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t an alphabet for more compactability
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134353_0134816 and there is one more point which i noted it down
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134816_0135989 like the material which is used for remote should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some allergy to either children or to an adult person
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0135989_0137124 and it should have an alarm clock a person if somebody wants to get up at around eight pm and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137124_0137523 and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137830_0138232 as janhvi said the buttons can be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0138232_0139184 we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139184_0139773 so even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139914_0140886 and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0140886_0141138 he should not be harmed in any way
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0141528_0142412 and findings i found out on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0142412_0143443 there are remotes which use the infrared red for controlling the different functionalities there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0143608_0144513 so you have different types of remotes with different light source which i use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145325_0145407 nächsten
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145632_0146151 and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for the multipurpose use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0146201_0147193 no like it can be used as a tv control plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing and it should have a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147193_0147988 and then to save electricity there should not be much more lots of circuits and all that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147988_0148961 and if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten oclock then it should be switched off at ten oclock automatically
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0148961_0149228 so that nobody else comes later and use it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0149547_0149771 yeah and then you can use a timer as well
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0150148_0150198 this
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0157657_0157792 tv television google
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0169295_0169374 you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0173696_0175737 generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from ten to forty then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people who have nervous problems
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0176300_0177029 in a family there will be an aged person children and a middle aged person but we cannot buy three different remotes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0177029_0177625 they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used by all the three schools
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0179221_0179323 which is a great
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0192775_0194536 but yeah i have a doubt like will it be cost twice effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0195575_0195659 아 오케이
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0199939_0200079 within that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0003972_0004279 just put on my microphone here and we will be right with you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007539_0007703 okay you want me to start right now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007998_0008644 could you put my slides up because i think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009682_0009830 for a purpose for i believe
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009830_0009886 yes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010847_0010963 thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010963_0011958 okay well i think we have done introduced ourselves so the functional requirements is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012069_0012334 that is where my discussion starts
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012334_0013030 well since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013030_0013619 i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013619_0014672 and the reason i just put that there like that is that in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0014672_0015069 you could say anything you want i mean how silly it sounds you know to run your car
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0015069_0016531 it should heat up your motor it should turn on your cd or whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0016562_0017633 so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is going to be to add a feature or how expensive it is going to be or if your time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0017633_0018011 it takes five years to develop this it is just something we can not do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018011_0018921 so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can not be done for one reason or another
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018921_0019778 and then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer we will try to then prioritize those
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0019778_0020047 so that was what i meant there
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020047_0020887 and as i said on the slide they are consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really going to be as important as money
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020887_0021322 because if we are going to sell this thing i think the best time to sell this is christmas present
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021364_0021801 twenty five euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021801_0022222 we want somebody to see it i think it is i just gotta have that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022222_0022406 and take out their wallet and buy it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022406_0022828 so it is going to be really attractive but it is got to go to market by september
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022828_0023485 because anything that you do not have already out there in september showing it around is not going to sell for christmas
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0023485_0026102 and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026131_0026563 so you are coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026563_0027101 and i will be coming to you to tell me what is going to make somebody take out their wallet you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027101_0027851 what is going to really be what they call the sizzle because we have got to sell the sizzle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027851_0029054 a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just going to take out their wallet and buy for christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029054_0029206 okay can we go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029486_0030625 i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the whole house idea really is not going to be possible
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0030625_0031175 so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031175_0031708 i would like the suggestions to be really specific so that we will have a list of things we can cross off
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031708_0032924 not something like you know whole house control and then i found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0032924_0033501 at the budget that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at we should be able to make it work the tv the vcr
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0033501_0034381 the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034381_0034459 i have to wind up
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034568_0034638 something
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038132_0038212 of course
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038308_0038440 i am sorry
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0041820_0041895 i am only gonna be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042700_0042838 all right thanks for that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042838_0043738 all right now other things that i found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0043738_0044093 a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044093_0044900 and that was thirty four percent of even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044900_0045388 so those are two things that we definitely do want to address
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0045388_0046099 we want to make it as simple as possible we want to make it obvious and intuitive to use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0046099_0047160 and then the things about finding it we talked about the light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047160_0047734 and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047734_0047873 okay can we go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047965_0048737 okay so my personal preferences in this project are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0048737_0049169 that is the selling point the thing that is going to make it an impulse purchase
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049169_0049802 because once there is no be back well in sales they always say be back still come back
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049802_0050107 if somebody says oh i will come back and get it next week you are dead
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050107_0050250 they are never gonna come back and buy it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050250_0050983 you have got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now now is a big word in my book for selling this thing
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051054_0051832 and in order to make it really saleable we have got to shorten the learning curve make sure it is really intuitive and easy to use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051832_0052603 we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that is why i am saying simplicity is good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052603_0052895 finding it is important obviously you can not use it if you can not find it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052895_0053566 so you have got to concentrate on the features that help you find it and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053566_0053911 there should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053911_0054476 so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say ah twenty five euros i am not going to take that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054476_0054921 has to be so great that they are gonna say oh twenty five euros is not much
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054921_0055696 and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0055696_0055895 okay that is about it for me right now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0071650_0072292 yeah that is already been eliminated by management
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0075399_0075459 the integrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0083710_0083926 yeah well that is been it that is been it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085300_0085700 it is good for marketing
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085700_0085982 i would say that will not add too much to the budget
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085982_0086172 no you do not think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0087557_0088267 do you think there is any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088416_0088504 no quiero nada
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088504_0088682 i help with the marketing
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0089144_0090328 because we had something sort of sexy for adults yeah we could have something sort of silly for children like an animal a little animal shape or an elephant so they can remember where it is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0093904_0094930 i think that that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person because i think there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0094930_0095705 i think one of the things people were complaining about when i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0095705_0096316 the changing modes with something i mean you and i all four of us we work with computers all the time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096316_0096672 changing modes is nothing for us but people who
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096845_0096954 you know and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0097752_0098520 very frustrated it is the kind of thing people learn by feel you do not feel the mood change
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0098520_0099118 so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be helpful yeah shapes also different
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0099118_0100076 it is not like a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100076_0100251 but we will get to that with you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100587_0100676 that is right yeah
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100676_0100766 no that is a good point
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0102143_0102905 yeah that is a good one because the clock could be really friendly when is your favorite show coming up
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103084_0103293 yeah a lot of times there is not a clock on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103293_0103559 and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103559_0103774 yeah that is good the clock is good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0114715_0115075 so we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116205_0116375 so it might be helpful if we had a look at that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116540_0116634 okay thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0117284_0117607 did you go back from that slide where she had that side up that is a
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0118011_0118110 yeah okay thank you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0135833_0135885 i did not
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0137802_0138030 an alarm clock in
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166276_0166737 well you know there is the old motto children under six never shop alone
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166737_0168094 so if you design something that is very attractive to children the mommy please mommy please you know we want it now we want to go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169274_0169314 that is right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169762_0169980 we make a banana chip one
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179007_0179132 what about the electronics
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179132_0179323 that is not really going to cost it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179406_0179688 that will not change much will it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179808_0179911 the question
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0184362_0185216 that is right and can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185216_0185658 or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185658_0186120 the same electronics and basically all that is going to be different is the plastic case
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186120_0186575 and in that case we could probably molded plastic is not all that expensive is it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186575_0186754 industrial history
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0188725_0188880 there is a real idea
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0191056_0191112 if they are never
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0192228_0192322 an alternate package
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0194615_0194841 i think the idea here is to do this
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0197756_0197905 finish making that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0198506_0198918 well we may have to come back to you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0200114_0200201 okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0201029_0201159 okay fair enough
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004216_0004299 hello everyone
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004479_0004718 um how uh how are we doing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004927_0005625 first we are going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0005625_0006870 in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working meaning gathering suggestions
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0006997_0007904 from everyone to see how she best could market this product within the budget that was given
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008138_0008820 in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008975_0009457 it is also an item that people lose a lot
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009457_0009814 so we should address that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009814_0010097 and of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010196_0010416 that is very simple to use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010556_0011343 in addition to that to make it sell of course the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011343_0011676 or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011777_0012321 so that the people are buying it now because in particularly smaller items
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0012321_0013004 that is a very important fact because if they say well i go home and think about it that will not work
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013079_0013750 also mentioned was it should have a very short learning curve
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013868_0014315 and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0014486_0015156 our technical manager has then said that he feels it should have a chip
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0015303_0016034 that has infrared bits and has an interface that controls the chip
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016141_0016636 therefore messages will be controlled in the same manner
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016636_0017055 there should be extra features like lit buttons maybe a beep
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017055_0017265 if too many buttons are pressed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017385_0018387 child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018493_0018818 you could see the time you know what show they want to watch
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018818_0019144 also mentioned was maybe different shapes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0019338_0020355 so the components of the thing should be button bulbs infrared bulbs battery chips wires and maybe some kind of a holder
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0020468_0020854 for the for the item
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0021026_0022213 francina who is our interface designer has mentioned that there
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0022213_0022856 course you would have an on off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it would have maybe a channel lock
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023009_0023561 particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023561_0023683 it should be compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023683_0024093 her personal favorite was it should be t shaped
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024093_0024326 and maybe having an alarm clock
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024326_0024794 and material should possibly be of non allergic nature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025022_0025699 the different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025804_0026480 maybe it should have electricity saving feature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0026583_0027722 and even possibly a timer so that people can program their favorite program right from the remote
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0027908_0028452 are we all in agreement that that is about what we discussed last time
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0028659_0029094 okay then we are looking for three presentations
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0029094_0029975 and i do not know whether the order matters much i do not think so so whoever wants it i can start yeah okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0030610_0030733 okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0031419_0031552 mm hmm
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0032145_0032361 and that is number two right
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037338_0037392 nine or
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037392_0037633 nine channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037796_0037911 nine channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037911_0037995 yes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071148_0071367 okay thank you very much
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071367_0071681 any comments on her presentation
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074229_0074411 yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074936_0075179 no i think these are her presentations
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0075179_0076320 but as far as the decision making we have to come back to that later but i just wanted to know whether anybody had anything to add to her
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076418_0076442 i am not sure
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076735_0076947 who wants to go next
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077090_0077226 okay and you can decide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077711_0077778 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0078760_0078872 or components design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0098452_0098489 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130408_0130522 and you have more pictures
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130522_0130739 we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134033_0134113 okay well thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134248_0134577 any particular comments by anybody
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0137498_0138269 we do not have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0138383_0138486 okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0151820_0152029 uh that is
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152200_0152485 concludes the presentation of everyone
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152485_0153203 and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0153362_0154015 and so what do you think on the concept
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0154112_0154194 of the remote
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0156370_0156455 that could be our
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0158654_0158929 well you teach you have to teach
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0161998_0162607 okay before we get too far off here the components of the concept is the energy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0162607_0162897 what kind of energy do we foresee
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0163699_0163926 okay then chip on print
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164176_0164267 and the case
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164267_0164756 and i think we all agree on the case we want to have something maybe bright colourful
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0165479_0165739 stainless design compact and strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166028_0166645 user interface concept interface type supplements
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166960_0167250 i will pee your area
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0167951_0168227 push buttons i guess for yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0168722_0168921 i am not sure what they mean by supplements
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169317_0169382 like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169701_0169802 of speech recognition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169802_0169923 right right
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171259_0171654 our next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171654_0172685 and the idea is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then to have the look and feel design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0172871_0173724 and the uid is supposed to come up with the user interface design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0173847_0174301 and the marketing expert with the product evaluation
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0174301_0175288 in this phase the two of you jana and francine have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay it says here
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175288_0175809 you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175954_0177111 if you have any questions you can always contact me or your coach i suppose
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0177327_0178398 so i think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes according to our timetable
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0178752_0178832 thank you very much
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0004829_0004877 good
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0040287_0040407 good
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077014_0077070 maybe
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077209_0077282 discipline too
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077830_0078010 the next one so oops
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0078010_0078122 it was the old
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0079698_0080715 this time i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0080715_0080945 can you go on to the news please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081013_0081722 i have just briefed down a few components which we require for the remote control construction
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081722_0082429 the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery it is a far it is a try it is like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082452_0082974 it can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082974_0083549 even if you just you know if it falls down then it does not break
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083549_0083753 so it should be strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083753_0084199 and there are no harmful materials used in that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084199_0084349 and it should be recyclable
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084523_0085230 and also using of coloring compounds like if we want to have different colors
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085230_0085823 blue red green so we have to use some coloring compounds
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085884_0086444 and the second important thing is integrated circuit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0086444_0087057 we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the heart of the remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087057_0087957 if it is not efficient then everything is going to be like less efficient so we should have a highly sophisticated one
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087957_0088348 and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088348_0088688 suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088688_0089579 it should be able to resist the temperature of high temperature and low temperature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0089579_0090048 and it should be equipped with timer and alarm facility
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0090140_0092106 and the other component we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is very very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which i think is like a battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092199_0092360 can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092605_0093019 a diode a transistor a resonator
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093019_0093692 these are all the technical electronic components which we have to use in a remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093692_0094109 battery i would like to suggest one thing if we
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0094162_0095016 if we will be able to make a rechargeable battery then we need not go for a high performance battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095016_0095434 even if it is a low performance battery it can not charge much
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095434_0095628 it is not a high voltage battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095628_0096094 and also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096094_0096748 so in that way we can cut the cost but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096832_0097215 and we have a circuit board in a remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097215_0097446 can we go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097446_0097754 and how it works how the remote controller works
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097754_0097852 when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098639_0098714 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098714_0098982 when you press a button when you do that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098982_0099792 you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a small circuit underneath the button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0099792_0100604 and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0100604_0101397 suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have pressed then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101397_0101770 it produces a more more scored line signal specific to that button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101828_0102181 every button every individual button has its own more school
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0102181_0103151 suppose the user has pressed button one then the circuit will generate a specific morse code to that button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103151_0103896 and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the led which translates the signal into infrared light
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103896_0104247 like you have got a signal by pressing a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104247_0104633 that morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104690_0105088 now that signal that moscut has to be amplified by the transistor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105088_0105449 that is the use of transistor v which we use in the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105449_0106205 it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the led and which translates the signal into infrared bits
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106205_0106914 the sensor in the tv can see the infrared light and seeing the signal it reacts appropriately
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106914_0107871 that when it sees the amplified morse code signal then it will know what action it has to do
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0107871_0108100 then it will do the appropriate action
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108100_0108406 so this is how the remote controller works
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108608_0108739 can you go to the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108818_0108950 yeah i have few pictures
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108950_0109602 when you look at the remote controller this is a normal remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109602_0109775 and the next piece
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109916_0110176 and we had a few buttons and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110176_0110781 and if you open the remote controller you have this circuit board and few electronic components
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110781_0111206 like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0111206_0112252 and also a capacitor three resistors and also resonator and the diode transistor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0112409_0113165 the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode transistors
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0113411_0114156 yeah you can see the ta eleven thousand eight hundred thirty five labeled chip
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114274_0114940 you can also see the green two green things are they are resistors
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114940_0115695 and just beside that you can see a transistor and a cylinder shape that one is a capacitor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0115695_0116236 and also there are resistors sorry there is a diode
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116236_0116386 kanyo go go on to dance
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116498_0116663 so this is the circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116663_0116861 the green one is a circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116861_0117506 actually building a circuit board is pretty easy and also it is inexpensive
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117506_0117850 it costs less than what you print on a paper
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117850_0118489 because when you when you are building some circuits some circuits and also wires
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0118489_0119311 it is better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119311_0119607 nothing like you know you do not need to use wires and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119607_0119842 it is not exactly wires we are using
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119842_0120132 it is just printing something on a board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120132_0120531 those prints will act as wires and circuits
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120671_0120979 so that green thing is a circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120979_0121709 and also you can see there are like access for buttons like when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0121709_0122749 the circuit under the button will be activated it will get some signals from it and it will send the signals to the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122749_0122929 integrated circuit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122929_0123067 in the good things
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123124_0123528 so these are the circuits underneath the buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123528_0123781 can you see the black round marks
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123781_0123904 they are the circuits
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123998_0124113 thanks beasts
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0124113_0125076 and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0125076_0126004 but a push button requires a simple chip underneath it but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126004_0126666 like for schools we have to go for a sophisticated and full complete shift
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126666_0127306 and as an energy source we offer a basic battery more engineers a hard dynamo
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127306_0127968 a kinetic provision of energy modern watches that you shake casually to provide energy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127968_0128534 so that also we can have in a battery or we can use solar cells
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0128993_0129358 yeah the product can be delivered into different cases
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0129358_0130124 usually the case is uncarved flat that we see usually a normal remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0130672_0131029 yeah maybe i have just one more slide at home
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131214_0131805 like we can have a material such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium we can not use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131805_0132583 and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the print
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132583_0132975 also it includes the infrared sender
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132975_0133592 yeah and for the movie just to develop a sample sensor speed sample speaker
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133716_0133830 yeah that is it
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133922_0134042 so full now
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135352_0135967 no no no the scrolling was different like you can go for switches like buttons or scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135967_0136326 which we used to do before ten years before i think
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136326_0136783 now nobody uses it because you need a sophisticated chip and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136783_0137172 so i think it is better we go for ordinary buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0137172_0137325 push buttons good job
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0155951_0155980 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0156682_0157287 i agree with that but i am very much doubtful how far it will work
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157287_0157809 because speech recognition has its own distance problems
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157856_0158196 yeah it is not distance problem it is recognizing a person is voice
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158196_0158744 maybe different people will be having different voices
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158875_0159324 so to get a good recognizing system it is a good thing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0160727_0160814 yeah but um yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0164914_0165021 trendy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0165087_0165205 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167428_0167885 like switches like we use buttons for user interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167992_0168050 push buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0169896_0169937 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0178831_0178919 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0021374_0021488 interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0029733_0029926 whoever wants to i can start to touch
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0030545_0030674 my stocking
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0032580_0032667 practice in three
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0033756_0034196 as an interface designer i would give more emphasis on the interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034196_0034711 how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034904_0035003 next please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035170_0035689 now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035689_0036777 this messages could be switch on off message switch to next channel message swapping the channels switching on to a particular channel
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0036777_0037125 like you can have the numbers one two three four up to nine
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037733_0037769 pardon me
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037914_0038091 yes nine numbers
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0038297_0039313 and then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0039580_0040685 then you should have a next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0040685_0040793 next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041040_0041593 then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041810_0042459 then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0042459_0043076 for example if you are watching a french program and you would like to have subtitles in english
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0043076_0043969 then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044193_0044767 then there should be some buttons which can control features like the color
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044767_0045303 color of the picture the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0045677_0045873 now there should be a memory switch
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046272_0046472 there should be a mute button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046472_0047301 suddenly if if if viewer he gets a telephone call and if you want he does not want to switch off the tv
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0047301_0048236 but he can reduce the sound he can bring the volume down and he can watch while talking he can watch the tv
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0048236_0048884 now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049045_0049572 it is an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049852_0050709 so remote can be can be designed which can have the voice recognizers you can record your own voice
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051039_0051517 which can be recognized by a voice recognizer in the television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051517_0052189 if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052189_0052811 the remote will automatically switch to the ninth channel
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052811_0053586 so the tv will have some recognizer which will recognize the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0053586_0053930 so this is one of the very important features a remote control can have
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054117_0054527 so this is one of the interface which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054720_0055229 a very simple interface which has all the important features
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055337_0055442 please next side
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055573_0056263 these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056263_0056861 sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056861_0057360 so you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057360_0057596 even a kid can use that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057596_0057810 so can you go on to the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057900_0058505 yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0058505_0059282 and this has multi purpose use it can be used for tv it can be used for cable satellites it can be used for vcr dvd is and audio
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0059519_0059766 and this has inbuilt voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060165_0060335 gwnaethon ni ddod yn ystod
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060335_0061014 yeah now this is an interface for a remote which a child can use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061014_0061664 this is user friendly it is very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061664_0062022 and this comes with different colors different shapes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0062692_0063723 and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0063815_0064076 attractive child interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064655_0064779 excellent please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064779_0065694 now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066114_0066729 i could lose that in a minute
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066729_0067250 so this is the jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to misplace or lose
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067389_0067648 this is one such interface which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067837_0068986 and the personal preference would be to incorporate speech recognizers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0069197_0069294 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0072873_0072896 아 너무 귀엽다
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0075564_0075593 weekend
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0108382_0108416 the next
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0113958_0114005 oh so
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0137241_0137310 good
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0154766_0155184 yes i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0155994_0156254 this could be one feature which could be celebrated
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159121_0159844 no it is like you are recording a question already
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159844_0160229 and then you are expecting an answer from for example you have a tv system
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160229_0160992 i am the user and my family members are the user i will already record a question like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160992_0161438 good morning like around eight oclock i want to see the news in the television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161438_0161756 so i will say just good morning and the tv will switch on
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161756_0162029 it will recognize my voice and it will switch on
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0164881_0164970 for coming
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0165119_0165290 it is a straw compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0167885_0167954 switch buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0168978_0169657 different types of features buttons yeah like you bet or like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0178837_0178885 thank you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0028468_0028599 i got pretty much the same
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065632_0065748 you do not know me
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065748_0066286 i could lose that in a minute
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072037_0072494 well looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072494_0072892 what no suggestion is bad
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072892_0073178 but we are gonna have to narrow it down a little more
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0073178_0074006 i do not think that we can get the t shape is good the child one is good it is a too big to miss place i think it is just funny
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074006_0074814 i do not think that is going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074814_0075047 it is gonna be a little bit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075159_0075207 yeah but
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075476_0075617 have to come back to them
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0076254_0076643 no i think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0084611_0084654 point
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0128530_0128654 that is interesting
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0134648_0135275 on the scroll and the push button you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0137109_0137442 we will just go for push buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138188_0138348 let me move right to my next slide
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138641_0139591 all right my method is i am interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0139591_0140222 and so i have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140222_0140793 i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140793_0141346 and then when i am out in people is houses or meetings or anything like that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141346_0141886 i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it is convenient in the conversation i ask about it
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141886_0142148 and i would encourage you all to do the same
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142148_0142685 and my findings from this is that you know small is beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142685_0143016 people like something that really fits in their hand
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143016_0143144 simple is beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143144_0143839 they do not want to have to squint at small print they want buttons whose functions are obvious
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143839_0144355 and they want as few buttons as possible and they do not care for the mode thing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144355_0144558 they want each button to do something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144558_0144676 and eye catching is important
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144676_0144923 it is gotta look cute it is gotta look appealing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144923_0145145 go ahead i am trying to finish fast for you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145145_0145782 and our preference is as far as i am concerned we have got to get to the market before the competition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145782_0146250 ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146250_0146840 so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146840_0147354 and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0147354_0148032 if we try to sell people it has too many great features the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148032_0148872 so we have got to narrow our selection down to two things i think that we are going to say are really great about our new product
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148872_0149481 and i have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149481_0149939 and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149939_0150324 and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150324_0150982 they are more back into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on them
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150982_0151470 so those are things maybe we want to look at as far as saleability of the item
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0154519_0154897 you want to try to come back to yours yes i would like to
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0155631_0155945 so speed tracking mission is most important as far as you are concerned
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156276_0156529 yeah that could be our star feature
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156529_0156793 that might be really good yeah i agree with that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0157714_0157817 distance problems
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163036_0163363 i think battery i think we all agreed on that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163363_0163659 that is going to be most cost effective and the best thing
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0164816_0165230 bright colorful trendy and strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0168945_0169070 so
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169264_0169694 yeah or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like or
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169694_0169928 i was a speech recognition teacher
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0170012_0170726 okay so why do not we put down speed track ignition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0176912_0177406 where they are hiding
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0003938_0004133 well hi everyone again
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0004324_0005440 like before i have to read the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0005591_0006464 it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0006567_0007903 designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the tv
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0007903_0008979 it should have nine channel buttons a next button volume buttons subtitle buttons switch to control features color contrast sharpness etcetera
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009020_0009435 if we have a memory switch a mute button in case the telephone rings or something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009435_0010653 speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to see to be integrated in this new remote
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0011091_0012013 should be child friendly design with few buttons colourful maybe with star shaped or other shaped buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0012013_0012926 she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013217_0013332 so hey
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013485_0014410 but her very personal favorite really she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0014410_0015315 the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0015315_0016438 she would like a special paste made out of plastic that is very strong not using any harmful materials should be recyclable and should be colorful
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0016564_0017116 should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0017284_0018010 should we like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0018010_0019144 technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitator diodes transistor resonator and if possible rechargeable battery
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019263_0019471 and of course the circuit board
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019599_0019852 and how it works you press the button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019852_0022001 the chip is morse code related relates the to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to consider
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022216_0022696 she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022804_0023264 the scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0023384_0023891 should be battery operated and of course should have the special cases
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0024040_0025146 the marketing expert who has to finally come up to market this product has been watching the competition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0025146_0026273 has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0026431_0026654 easy to use and it should be eye catching
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0027036_0027745 from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0028058_0029057 to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029213_0029697 too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029697_0030149 so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030288_0030916 it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030916_0031126 she feels that is really what people want today
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0031293_0032097 and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0032218_0033189 the energy should be battery should be on a chip should be trendy design compact and strong and should have buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0033325_0033798 and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0034072_0034535 now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0042922_0043023 that is it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0046331_0046436 நேடி
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052178_0052253 what kind of button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052399_0052600 a menu a menu one one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064279_0064480 yes the buttons are all raised right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064566_0064651 race and if you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0065317_0065522 we have two hands to open it up
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0067081_0067808 yes and it sort of sticks up so that you do not have to first go like oh yeah here it is all in
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0069570_0069806 so if you are left handed or right handed
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072255_0072883 i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072883_0073380 like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0073933_0074457 will have symbols so that they usually really know you know it does not have to good point because
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0074976_0075613 but anyway it has to have some kind of symbols text or something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075772_0075805 that is right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075924_0076155 okay i just want to make sure that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0076927_0077000 right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079005_0079329 now what are our special features for the marketing
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079329_0079718 that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0080276_0080937 and then the other thing would basically be shape or practicality of use
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0081109_0081159 i will
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084293_0084575 okay now having said that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084864_0085297 no this was evaluation criteria which we just have done
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0085297_0085576 now we are going to talk about financing
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086184_0086437 when there is a production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086485 that you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086604_0086809 but that is after the financing oh okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086872_0086929 you see
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087539_0087996 okay we had looks and voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087996_0088686 okay now on the financing we bring up the there it is
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0088686_0089440 okay energy source we say that is battery right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0089637_0089762 okay now
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090085_0090281 so we i guess we use one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090983_0091358 cellulose you are trying to change the fructivity
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091358_0091446 oh that is nice
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091530_0091813 i could just change it to you on that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091913_0091984 thanks a lot
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092731_0092979 oh okay yeah okay let us see
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092979_0093328 okay one okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093328_0093443 i will go away
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093443_0093918 kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093918_0094226 electronic simple chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094226_0094356 is that what we are using
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094356_0094432 one of those
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094559_0094685 on
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094685_0094872 okay one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094872_0095121 regular chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0095286_0095859 that is all we need the one case uncurved flat single curved double curved
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096704_0096864 double curved
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096864_0096935 one of those
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097223_0097444 case material supplements
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097444_0097645 plastic we sent right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097826_0097962 wood rubber
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098268_0098462 but yes but
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098722_0099264 that is just for the case material special color so we are having that right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0099509_0099901 and then we have the interface push buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100368_0100500 scroll wheel no
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100500_0100770 and the various go with lc display
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101319_0101533 button supplements special colors
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101770_0101856 special form
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0102276_0102552 and special material rubber wood yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103051_0103417 total seven point six whatever that means
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103665_0103782 that is the price
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104079_0104235 eight point two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104683_0104824 that is points
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104967_0105054 eight point two right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105236_0105427 so it looks like we are
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105564_0105656 well within budget
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0106093_0106272 i should say i suppose
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0107999_0108108 mm hmm
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108661_0108807 felly roedd y pethaun dda iw ddod yn ymwneud âr pethaun dda
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108807_0108969 now i dock in its computer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108969_0109144 i miss you i hear this yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0109683_0109836 okay fine
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110140_0110431 okay good so that is the good news
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110431_0110834 you are going to be popular
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111164_0111424 so that i think financing was pretty simple
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111535_0112165 now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0114600_0114759 you want to go the next night yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131419_0131783 i just realized one thing
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131783_0132180 in the financing there was no room for our voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0132429_0133181 and i do not know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that well
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0133554_0133711 eight hundred and twenty yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134116_0134616 i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four point three zero
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134767_0135522 but we have no way of presenting that to management as a finished product
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0135522_0136083 as a finished product and saying okay we serve waste recognizer that costs so much
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136202_0136654 so we just have to be aware of that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136654_0137085 i mean and know whether the four hundred and thirty will really cover that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0139488_0140779 i am sorry to interrupt that but i just remembered that there was no room for any special features
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0140907_0141086 so be aware of that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141086_0141328 you want to go to this next slide
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141540_0141654 i do not know
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141654_0141780 yes that was my last song
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0144286_0144428 bye and then up
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0145622_0145736 i think you can make it there
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0148505_0148664 yes i think shape is one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0149756_0149886 you gave me the full order
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150247_0150389 um i dunno
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150516_0150699 i think i would give it at least a two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152596_0152725 collar
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152988_0153157 i like the colors
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0154776_0154971 i think i will give it a two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0156922_0157788 well it is also you can not really try it out the other things you have more it is more tangible so from that point of view but
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0158088_0158204 i will give it a three
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0163765_0164417 here is what we are looking at satisfaction on for example room for creativity
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0164981_0165391 is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0171858_0172740 yeah always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can not
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0172740_0173341 with this particular item we probably can not just add a whole lot of more things
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0173341_0174395 we need to leave space money wise for the voice recognizer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0174986_0175438 so the question really is how do we feel with the project process
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0175438_0176658 are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0176806_0177143 i think personally i think i am pretty happy
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177258_0177401 uh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177613_0178216 and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0178586_0179168 and i think teamwork i think was very very good
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179398_0179899 and i think we are happy with the means we used
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179899_0180315 we used whiteboard we did not use digital pens against all these things
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180745_0180864 yes we could
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180927_0182201 it is maybe not in the best position in the room sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and i think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0182303_0183135 because it was better positioned yes i think so i think absolutely and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183135_0183441 did we find new ideas
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183441_0183527 i think we do
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183727_0184471 i think we did in more than one respect and so i think we did very well here
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184719_0184848 are the costs within budget
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184848_0184947 yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184947_0185232 je projekta evalirata
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0185367_0185861 so she
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186464_0186776 so i thank you all very much
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186776_0187153 i think this was very good and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187272_0187669 i think we did come up with a new product that is feasible
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187669_0188086 feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0188280_0188412 so thank you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0189421_0189660 i always get it on her like getting it off
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0190479_0190598 oh yeah we have time
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035625_0035939 so this is what we have made
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035939_0036376 this is a model of the remote controller which we are going to build
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0036376_0038147 this is in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is a bluey color bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons so it is a look wise it is beautiful
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038147_0038429 and also compact in shape
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038429_0039128 and also it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039300_0039665 yeah oops
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039828_0041301 the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and which is strong and also for the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0041445_0042426 the material is plastic and for the buttons it is soft rubber oh that is good yeah that is awesome
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0042426_0042999 yeah because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043039_0043332 and then for the lead
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043332_0044239 for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0044413_0044878 and the button buttons part will be explained by farzana
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0062030_0062128 still
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0073522_0073605 these buttons will
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0074614_0074775 going into an international market
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075161_0075253 it has to have some
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075541_0076079 we can have on the case itself that is right it will be printed on the case okay i just want to make sure
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0077042_0077318 it is a snail shell he goes right back into his shell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0078699_0078921 like that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0094238_0094352 is that what we are using
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0096277_0096347 this is
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0098501_0098936 i think that is for rubbers that is just for the case material
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103508_0103763 i think that is the price
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103915_0104042 be
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0108986_0109101 i am issue
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133675_0133765 i think
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133822_0134090 we have still got four year olds to go to spend
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138186_0138315 maybe that will buy us
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138953_0139031 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0140240_0140346 included
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0148666_0148936 okay and yeah she was
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151175_0151364 even i think it is wrong
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151364_0151441 it is great to know
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0153266_0153342 yeah one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0155570_0155756 maybe two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0158869_0159019 three
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165533_0165606 maybe get your
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165682_0166106 yeah include some more buttons and features
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166106_0166342 we can make the buttons few buttons smaller
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166342_0167206 i think they are quite big so i think we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0167206_0167460 if we want to have more features in that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0168404_0168517 definitely
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0169338_0169663 yeah instead of having two mute buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0177249_0177331 uh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0178437_0178646 i do not think so
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0180636_0180757 อินิยา
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0183540_0183677 thank you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0188433_0188521 ありがとうございます
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0189656_0189882 i think we still have some time left
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190111_0190291 you have
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190908_0190969 yeah whenever
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0034881_0035112 does they look alike the button part one  ll explain
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0044970_0045542 now we decided upon including certain features in our remote
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0045542_0046564 now these features include the signal emitting signal it is the led or net the infrared
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0046564_0046958 now we have included the switch on and off button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0047312_0047703 now we have included another feature that is the mute button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048112_0048363 on the side of the model
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048363_0048767 then we have included one to nine buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048890_0049190 for controlling the programs the different channels
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0049751_0050264 we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0050738_0051294 and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0051690_0052136 now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052259_0052337 अपने पाइट पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के लिए पाइट के ल
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052416_0052502 menu
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052613_0052695 at the center
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052836_0053649 we have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color sharpness brightness
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0053896_0054005 this is a picture
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054300_0054709 we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054854_0055307 now this is a special feature which we have included
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055307_0055379 have this button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055525_0056591 is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0056591_0056916 if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next jump
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057045_0057353 to take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057662_0057755 swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0058428_0059316 swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059316_0059420 okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059919_0060901 and at the end this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer which will recognize the user is voice and then it will act accordingly
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061477_0061773 so this is a proposed model
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061773_0061987 now the marketing expert has to
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0062120_0062796 give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0063532_0063628 yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0067684_0067788 on an initial
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0068745_0069236 these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069236_0069323 yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069916_0069948 bye
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069986_0070147 the men yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0070404_0071261 these two are to increase or decrease the volumes okay and these two are to scroll the program channels
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0071408_0071569 school app was screwed down the channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0073384_0074001 yes it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0074001_0074203 so that they usually really
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076128_0076730 and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076730_0076808 a shell shape
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076928_0077026 right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0077093_0077224 he goes right back to the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0078678_0078822 good luck

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0104663_0104891 nine points
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0108498_0108598 in the tester
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0123878_0124032 that is what people are going to get
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0138250_0138356 us
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0140728_0140766 the state

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165536_0165724 we can always improve
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165869_0165978 yes features
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0171906_0172054 always bearing in mind that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0178402_0178668 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0180493_0180786 yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0185498_0185849 i am sorry
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0188429_0188486 i feel it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0190292_0190402 is it forty minutes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0013037_0013522 she was challenged on that point
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0039502_0040024 you used to have all the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0042228_0042451 oh that is good yeah that is us in front of you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0046289_0046397 on any d
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0052441_0052514 thank you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053828_0053902 of the screen
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053902_0053969 this is a
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058041_0058417 the next channel in the numeric pattern or
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058778_0058833 yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0059376_0059485 okay yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0062821_0062982 okay well um
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063112_0063579 what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063579_0064261 that you can really hold it in one hand you do not need two hands and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0064511_0065246 the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065246_0065653 turn it upside down move it up and down i really like that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065653_0066194 you really did a good job on that my little designers
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066194_0066948 and i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066948_0067118 that is a really good good
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067220_0067346 so that is really
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067786_0068008 the color is very attractive
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068008_0068633 these buttons around here are the mute
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068759_0069052 these the front buttons which are here the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069159_0069314 on both sides yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069314_0069519 so you can push either one yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069703_0069948 and this brings the menu up on the screen
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069948_0070393 this brings the measure of the space and the orange ones are
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071210_0071387 it is so awkward
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071387_0071489 परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप परस्ट रूप प
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071589_0071843 that looks like something i can sell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0072104_0072410 okay now i am supposed to i have one question
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0074373_0074971 that is a good point because we need the symbols because we are going into an international market we can not have anything that is language dependent
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075356_0075447 symbol
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075447_0075544 text or something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076158_0076217 one more feature
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076855_0077167 for the snail we have the snail shell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077167_0077358 he goes right back into his cell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077358_0078888 well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0078888_0079032 that would really work
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0079632_0080257 i think voice recognition is our big selling point because nobody else seems to have that in this price range
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0080981_0081579 yeah well i think that everybody is going to say their remote control is practical
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0081579_0082128 i think we have to dwell on the appearance
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082128_0082331 you are really going to have the best thing
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082445_0082708 cutest remote control on the block
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082708_0083555 so i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083555_0083713 i think those are the two things to push
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083713_0083762 the look
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083897_0084011 and the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084011_0084185 they are gonna be our two selling points
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084556_0084761 i am supposed to make a little presentation are not i
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0085663_0086259 ah in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086517_0086566 yeah that is me
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086744_0086822 oh okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086822_0087076 sorry
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0087076_0087088 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0089556_0089598 that is right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0092477_0092677 can you just fill it in the yellow boxes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0096533_0096673 i guess it is double occur
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0097975_0098164 rubber because we are gonna have the soft buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0098936_0099082 oh okay nice special
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0100797_0101105 no no but i did not put the clock in it after all
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0112217_0112448 i am going to take my file now so you can bring it up
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0113791_0113889 keşif
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114272_0114502 okay let us go just to the next slide right away
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114688_0114846 yeah okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114846_0115717 okay well obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first ask the big question will it sell
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0115717_0116800 and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we have not thought of
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0116800_0117268 we can not accept every suggestion of course but maybe we just need to get a few
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117268_0117552 and show the prototype to consumer research groups
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117552_0118356 we do not want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we will not sell any
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118356_0118628 so we have to get some input from those people
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118628_0119064 and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119064_0119388 we think it is good we are going to get behind it and sell it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119388_0119535 next slide please
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119781_0120514 okay now the things that i was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120514_0120928 i wanted the shape to be biomorphic i did not want anything with angles i am all square
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120928_0121283 i wanted to be comfy and roundy so we got that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121283_0121644 size is small the color is bright and warm which is what we wanted
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121644_0122239 we want the feel to be as soft as possible we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122239_0122686 even though it is going to be hard plastic it feels good in your hands so that is nice
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122686_0123207 and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use it before they buy it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0123207_0124124 so paradoxically the other features in other words the look the feel and the shape that is what people are going to get in the store
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124124_0124344 they do not have a television in the store they can not play with it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124378_0124658 so they will be our main selling points
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124658_0125417 so those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0125417_0126043 okay so the shape i think is a one
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126043_0126301 that is really really excellent shape
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126301_0127341 the size is small and these points are in the importance for the marketing these are not in how i feel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127341_0127967 i think that it is plenty small enough to sell but i think we are sort of right the scale is one to seven
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127967_0128408 i think we are sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128456_0128620 and our color i think is great
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128620_0128975 the colors are bright and warm and really do a great job there
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128975_0129552 and given the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0129552_0130090 and then functionality i think you did a really good job on functionality
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0130090_0131014 obviously we could have added different functions but then we disturbed something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0131014_0131379 so i think that basically we have got a great product and we can get off the running with it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133143_0133582 well we had what eight euros twenty as our cost
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133730_0134107 and so we have got we have still got four year olds to go to spend
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0134602_0134830 well um
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137150_0137939 well as we know in today is technological world you can do just about anything at any price the problem is quality
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137939_0138351 so we are just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0138351_0139103 and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0139103_0139488 as we have seen with so many of these kind of products
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141252_0141534 expert well is not this my last slide
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141607_0141656 good
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141656_0141844 i think that was my last lockdown
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142274_0142365 okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142596_0142934 and i am supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142934_0143589 and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now so if you put my last slide back up there
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0143817_0144241 i am sorry
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0144660_0144894 well because i can not remember where i put all the

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149676_0149785 on side
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149863_0150178 i give it a four i feel it is just average
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0151479_0152066 you are the designer
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152066_0152323 and then how about how we do the color
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152668_0152819 i gave it a watch
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152819_0153059 i really like all those nice bright white colors
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153405_0153617 okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153617_0153839 and how about the single
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0154126_0154680 taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155051_0155410 okay i will give it three two and i will give three
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155687_0155789 tu veux
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155919_0156691 and the next is functionality where i admit i was a little hard on our team here
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0158686_0158775 okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159432_0159557 so uh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159803_0160156 looks like we have got ourselves a pretty good product
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0160156_0161362 functionality is the only place where maybe after thinking about maybe having a friend having another meeting
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0161362_0161910 but otherwise i think we are ready to go with this product
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0162068_0162501 does anybody else have any other comments or any other things that you feel we should evaluate
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0167642_0168775 well then again if we are gonna do the speech recognition thing there are gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that or the recording of the speech
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0168775_0169598 so that is where we are going to have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute button instead of having two mute buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0169598_0170293 and then maybe we can do something with the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170425_0170535 the volume control
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170535_0170789 we can put that all on one button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170918_0171804 and a couple of other maybe consolidate some of the usage and see what we can do with that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0177170_0177576 i am pretty happy with it it is something i think i can market
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178213_0178697 i think you have done a good job yes yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178981_0179274 i think we worked well together as a team
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0180322_0180811 maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182205_0182421 and then we used the slide because it was better positioned
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182537_0182670 i think absolutely
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0183545_0183798 i think we
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185190_0185260 yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185896_0186554 today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them we have shampoo
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0188646_0188930 watch out i have my cord behind me
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0190501_0191179 yeah we have time but we do not have to we were told we could end the final meeting at any time okay whenever we felt we were finished yeah we did not have to

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834 first i will tell you a little bit about the sitting
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037 you can see the field point is there
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797 they will record more actions and you will have wires and other files that will record your voice
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416 there are also some microphones there but you do not have to pay a lot of attention to those
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014 because it will disappear when you do not intend to
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424 this is our project documents folder
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919 there are some notes in it already i see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145 i will start with the presentation kickoff
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968 it is pretty modified by the ministry

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227 well i do not know if you have noticed but we are working for real reaction
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529 it is a company in electronics
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476 fashion electronics make it work a lot of effort in designing the body itself
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865 i am martin buit and i am the project manager so i will direct you through the project
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177 this is our agenda
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771 we are open to great music music planning sketching and classing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902 maybe i can sit down and i can take some notes or let us see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442 maybe you can take the meds sure
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136 i do not know it is not a lot of right but just if you hear something like that just like that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525 as you can see it is the opening
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917 ik weet niet of ze het een beetje gedaan hebben
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314 have you all seen the corporate website already
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701 have you seen any flaws in it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949 i think i found one
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019352_0019396 kathryn
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753 see if it works
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054 that does not work here
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335 okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274 maar op de corporele informatie kant was er echt remote in plaats van echte reactie
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934 real remote is not really the company we are but then you know
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335 okay what are we going to do
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735 our project aim is as you can see a new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113 that is the original trendy and user friendly
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811 so these are the points by we also hired you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629 we have got a marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214 and industrial designer that is also used for the original
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776 and we have got our user interface design
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899 it is possible
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206 that is about the near remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089 project metal is the three phases we are going through
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568 the first functional is the design the virtual work the meetings
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992 na de fractie conceptueel en detail design
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683 i had some little indications from here
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177 but i think you know it already mayor so
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124 the industrial designer is going to work on the working design components design and a bit of the look and feel design
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102 the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design user interface concept and user interface design
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0031102_0032189 and the marketing expert was doing a little bit of user requirements specification trend watching and product evaluation
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473 that is a bit what you are going to do
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816 but that will be all worked out all the amazings
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524 then we have got our first tool training
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263 we are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here so it is handy if we have a little bit of training first
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870 as you can see we have got the smart boards here and here and the white board
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579 in the whiteboard here is a little toolbar on this side
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682 here are some pictures
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790 you can save
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251 these functions we do not have anything to do with only undo you can undo a little
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563 piece of drawing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897 a blank new document for each person
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144 select the pen eraser
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423 got your redone this to do anything with
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867 then we have got our pen
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005 this band
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928 it is really funny because you can draw with it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305 you can also select the current color and the line width
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673 but first you have to select the pen function
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011 we are going to work with it in a minute
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261 okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873 it is very simple and it is easy to draw your findings and drawings in there
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081 ثم
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513 a short thing about documents
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935 we have got our shared folder project name project what is that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279 eu vou te dar um toque noutros
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895 but you all found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697 en deze zijn ook aan het openen op de smartboards dus als je een document wilt laten zien dan is de opening van de following
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097 here is the simple toolbar
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751 that is what i just said save print move back or forward one page
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947 you can switch between the different colors
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479 and then we are going to try out the whiteboard
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119 so as you can see we are going to draw an animal
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785 just to get a bit familiar with it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932 no it is because i am running away
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351 does everybody see my thing with the mouse
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721 we are going to draw an animal
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367 and just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213 the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607 this i can start from there
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177 you can use this pen by holding it like a little child
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801 because if you hold it like this sensors will get blocked
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366 another thing is you have to be a bit slow
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895 os ydych chin mynd i mi ddryfior ffordd yna byddwn yn gwybod
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051895_0052898 reduce formal clear color think pray appropriate
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052898_0052990 then the line
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502 eight seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty forty one forty two forty three forty four forty four forty five forty six forty seven forty eight forty eight forty nine fifty fifty fifty one fifty two fifty three fifty two fifty three fifty three fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four fifty four
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863 now you will see my drawing capabilities
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193 that is very nice
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579 you have to go real slow
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800 i was trying to go adult
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204 sorry
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330 and go to that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775 now we have got another function
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063 are you ready
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197 and i can do
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576 this is it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878 that is good
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429 and i am going to write down a few of his characteristics
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744 uh
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469 i have got the text tool
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677 this is typically a little action i think
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107 maybe i should hold it a bit
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408 that is the same thing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073 i think that is it because if you want to do it like this then you can strike
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319 i do not know just try
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182 this is not mine

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319 i am not great at this but i am not great at this but i am going
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477 ychwanegol
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194 so now i am gonna hand over ben to the gameplay sheet to you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407 go ahead
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838 maybe it is easier to draw with a smaller line lift i think
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126 because this is going a little bit in i did
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983 that is nice
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669 it is a real ditchy
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081 recognition
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551 maybe you can also write your name somewhere
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084551_0084628 interesting
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666 yeah just think
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351 jävlar det är skonik
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283 is it your cat or did you find him on the street
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495 thanks
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818 so everybody knows how the whiteboard now
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508 if you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the line for it just ask and go ahead
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679 yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677 it is been a good day
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990 dus je hebt het doel in de blok
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506 move along to the project finance
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430 as you can see for a remote control the sennheiser g bride is twenty five euros
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648 i should have a prize
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946 our profit aim is fifty million euros
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775 that is the least we have to get from our remote controls we have to work together to reach our names
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717 we can do it internationally so we have to focus on different kind of users different kind of cultures and different kind of trends as well
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143 but that is all in the vader stadium
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933 de productie kost twelve five euro
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883 so that is also a point we have to keep in mind that we want to make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060 it goes where
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394 so just try to remember these points
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393 selling price twenty five of it is fifteen million but more important is the international market we are trying to focus on
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770 and production cost maximum twelve point five euros
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275 so this leads us to our little discussion
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783 we have got about five or ten minutes left for discretion
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140 so i am gonna sit down and think
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442 it is easier
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622 i have got a message
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120622_0120698 slight news
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118 so just on the side note
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952 maybe you have to say the magic word
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208 is it doing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553 maybe you have to just clap it down
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122828_0122914 back up again
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568 so that is it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123733_0123799 itself
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948 it is really back on that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102 vosotras
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649 let us get those laptops
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124998_0126251 but does everybody has experiences with remote controls i mean not the ordinary remote controls but also a little bit different ones
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555 i can use for other
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0127905_0127958 mm
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777 yeah i have got one at home
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653 and you can program i think eight different devices in it you can use it for your television anything else
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326 and it also operates on infrared so you have to get a little device inside your room
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868 and then you can operate it from the third or second floor
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716 so that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or dvd player downstairs and you have got a link to your tv on the second floor yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893 so that is a pretty handy
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460 ik ben ook niet de
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401 i think if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control that makes it a lot easier as well
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133401_0133481 see you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757 it is good to remember
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250 yeah that is nice
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482 so we want different functions
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420 and we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720 but i do not know if it will exceed the production cost
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021 so this is something we have to find out i think
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893 and other functions for remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329 you can make it to
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137725_0137806 she approve
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500 so these are a few things you can think of
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030 i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040 so i can see that race status
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726 that is not usual
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142726_0142792 all our ods
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142928_0142988 we got it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680 any questions about this presentation
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793 kickoff presentation
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790 okay then i will put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048 and then it can all work
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405 finish meeting now
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955 we can all work on our own projects
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455 okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639 förbidda
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0076704_0076747 she

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539 uh
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802 cest pas grave ça va cest sûr
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126436_0126474 no really

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580 okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751 now the second floor
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137604_0137671 sure
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110 waterproof alright
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494 you never know
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0141037_0141123 okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004079_0004149 my heart is free
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004810_0004844 thank you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353 okay that is interesting
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0018307_0018353 yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267 i can not say i paid much attention to it but
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0021216_0021268 oh yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0046928_0047006 that was interesting
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892 well thinking about a swordfish
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0071206_0071246 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613 
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584 okay i love what you are like but here you go
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833 this is my
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163 thank you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320 i am not even talking about this it is spreading my butt
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084648_0084705 yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084935_0084977 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049 it is going really slow is the rain
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144 they are building mountains
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316 and that is just literally the
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191 okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667 garfield
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700 
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0110215_0110298 would be
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120296 there you go
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414 so just on the side note why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0123611_0123667 it is tough now
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159 well it was man
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124708_0124779 there we are
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126746_0126820 well yes
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508 kind of brought tv at home and a dvd player so they got like a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030 one for the tv one for the video recorder one for the dvd player
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442 and i think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0130808_0130852 really
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967 so i think you can take me to the end
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0134155_0134240 that is a chair and a jolt
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478 but that would be really good if we could do that
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534 i think it has to be shock proof
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045 my remote control tends to fall off
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381 yeah one other little thing
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763 i thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140875_0140940 so i can see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213 how much is left on the battery
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994 but they will also really drag up the production costs so we will have to see about that too
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437 ond efallai unrhyw ddiddordeb
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0144083_0144179 i think so
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0145529_0145582 we will be seeing all of you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0147202_0147250 law
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232 well i think if we are going to use a touchscreen we are going to go way above the twelve point five euros
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266 so it would not be very robust
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531 it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777 okay i have got a presentation about the working design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003 first about how it works
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099 it is really simple of course
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285 everybody
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468 you should press this button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999 the remote determines what button it is uses the infrared to send a signal to the tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301 the tv switches to the frequency or what function it is
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811 so we have got the plate
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206 it is got conductive disks for every button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983 when the user presses a button a signal gets sent it goes to the lab and transmits it to the tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340 it is a very simple device technically
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614 so this is a schematic overview
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802 we have got the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017 power source
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468 and when a button gets pressed it goes to the chip
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059 the chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324 when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094 well i think we should use default materials simple plastics
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441 keep the inner working simple so it is robust
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841 i think we should focus on aesthetics the design and the user interface
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301 because if you are going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105 you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it comes back in every product
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046 so in my idea it is going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250 that is it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073 think that if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i do not know if you have heard about it in the news
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281 the elderly mobile phone
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249 if we make a remote control just with that idea in mind we could make tons of money
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872 we do not have to focus on the design then but on functionality
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940 we just
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346 change our focus on the project anything
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636 we can sell this
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330 that is a good point
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275 besides that if we are going to focus on elderly people they will have to adapt
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548 they are not used to using scroll buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860 so perhaps we should stick to the basic layer
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426 it should be possible yes
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604 it is not too fancy
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913 and if the remote stays rather small it is super fast
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902 so we are just going to focus on the extras
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548 like with the keychain if you press so it goes
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974 i think we will have to choose between the docking station and the screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187119_0187191 so let us go
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094 i do not think they have different television sets
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344 in every country
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002 everybody in fun is place again
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370 감사합니다
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777 okay so this is our second meeting
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100 and still fairly
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726 now we are going into the functional design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007726_0009245 the important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements technical function design and the working design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719 so that we can move on to the second phase
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959 the first space
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273 first announcement
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705 there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288 there is our ghost mouse again
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018 that means that you can have a little trouble with air conditioning that is because it feels
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339 that is in ways c and e
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853 so it should be over in a couple of days
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438 it is going to be cold anyway so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584 than our agenda
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747 that is where it is the opening
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911 this time i will take the minutes
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375 you are going to have a presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502 oh dear
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365 and we have got forty minutes for the whole presentation congratulations
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769 so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354 and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291 and then the decision on the control functions which you want to include
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511 i have got forty minutes for all of it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947 so i suggest let us start with the first presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134 who wants to be first
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337 maybe it is easier if you yeah i think you will tell them your presentation as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787 which function you have and what you are going to talk about
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054004_0054103 thank you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516 anybody have any questions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829 that is the function requirements
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054829_0054905 okay that is good
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160 ja jeg har taget et sækant
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571 yeah you can take your time
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860 we will make a couple of plenty of slides
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0058229_0058319 coders
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638 but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610 anyone else questions about the technical functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654 that is nice
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727 ja det er sjovt
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130 maybe we can first listen to your presentation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669 and then we will have a little discussion about the requirements
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351 inkletschmendung
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0102358_0102401 thank you
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926 okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the function we all have and what we are doing right now
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724 i am the project manager so i am here to mess things up and fill in some new requirements
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739 we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0106739_0107827 that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096 so it has to be simple
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600 another point is we have to skip the data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108600_0109601 because in the world of the upcoming internet we think data tax is going to be a thing of the past
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069 and it is a function we do not need in our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739 internet is also mentioned just to go in the function you can use
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063 en misschien ook op tv die ook opgepast worden
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672 another one is the customer is forty plus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578 that is the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257 and this is a bit pity for the marketing expert
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682 because he was aiming on the younger persons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200 so we have to find a market which is above forty plus which will suit our
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648 remote control and the other way around
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449 and we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026 so it has to be visible in our design in the way our defuse works
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572 and we have to be very clear on this point as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721 so i suggest
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215 let us have a discussion on the convolve function
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0117632_0118925 we can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091 against the node data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559 это очень красиво
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107 step pretty
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383 i think we can not
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238 ik denk dat we veel kunnen doen met het ontwerp en de simpele knopjes die ook al gezegd zijn
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970 if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577 or just a remote which is suitable for the market you want to reach because it is forty percent of the market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305 and if you look in holland the whole generation of forty plus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992 fifty plus it is the biggest share of the of the whole population now
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668 but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456 people think that is the device i have looked for although i did not realize it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604 so let us try it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136353_0136447 it is a big success
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731 make a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367 we do not have to focus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011 i simply think
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830 that the new products we are going to make specifically design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726 are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0140860_0141918 and i think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419 that is what you told us channel selection is important
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809 volume selection power and data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055 no we have not voted yet i think data text can be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587 it can be a function as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776 but only if it is going to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134 higher the cost
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705 cause i do not know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well but i do not think it will be a problem
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019 where is the text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751 so i suggest thinking of definitely
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374 is anybody really against tater tacks
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956 we will just keep the data text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477 it is good idea as well especially for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786 maybe we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123 make that um
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725 another point of advantage in our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587 we make a button for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173 for elderly people that they can think oh i want to have subtitles and push the button and they get the big subtitles
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064 so i think that can be very useful in our advantage
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617 functionality should be few buttons you said
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239 i think that is very important we have a few buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701 so to keep it simple
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318 but do you need a way
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219 do not need it do you need the buttons for one to zero
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339 maybe
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911 misschien kun je
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797 met die kan je de scroll button implementeren
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154 or a joystick like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450 there are other ways to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649 if you look at telephones
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168 the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0163536_0163590 so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236 this is the knowledge there
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076 yeah we can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display and if it is too much we can reconsider it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328 i think that one leaves very much with them
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493 or they are done
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813 the number of residents
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082 i think it is very important in the design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763 you can make a very fancy design by putting the buttons on the right places
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041 als je minder patternen hebt kun je veel meer doen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339 to operate on your tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393 so we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172982_0173031 that is right
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434 so you should just we could better focus on for example the docking station
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717 like other functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210 instead of less parents
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671 do you think the docking station will
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115 is allowed in the budget we have
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504 it is not too far
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153 i think that is
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456 that is a good advantage point as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363 if we have a guarantee looking docking station or sorry that is a nice requirement
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0179483_0179580 installation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0180046_0180112 i think so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259 that is a good point
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868 you said they easily get lost as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939 so maybe we should implement the audio side or something
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706 so you know where it is audio signal should be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126 i think it is not too expensive
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279 another
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692 oh and the lcd screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591 i do not know if that will cost too much
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291 i feel a bit too much of it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015 just the lcd
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170 just a normal screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190317_0190417 it is most really
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679 to some extra info
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060 i think that is a good idea as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584 this is the smallest screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580 thanks for the good info
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270 i think that should be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639 um let us see what did we say
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233 it should be fancy design easy to learn
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469 few buttons you talk about that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768 docknestation lcd
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087 general fensions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280 default materials
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196452_0197489 i think that is a good idea as well because other people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688 so it does not really matter
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944 so i think probably
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316 and let us specify the target group
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966 are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687 because i think what we are going to design now is for people above sixty maybe
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201043_0201135 what do we want
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925 if you want to profilate us with for example the telephone for elderly people we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252 target the real elderly people
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905 so that is the way it looks
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535 and you are talking about six thousand two hundred and eighty for example
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642 and different cultures
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205642_0205713 bye bye
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008 we have got five minutes left
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0207008_0207094 and with
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360 in different languages
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085 or you have to put a language that will be a bit unnecessary
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464 it is better to put it on different markets
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880 so that is the door i guess
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323 uh then a few small things
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808 okay
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226 i will put the minutes in the project documents folder
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102 what we are going to do for the next reading is the industrial designer will do the component
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432 as an interface designer i use interface concepts and trend watching
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212458_0213492 so just keep in mind things we have said about the target group requirements and the trends that you are going along
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955 and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385 so thank you for this meeting
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656 and i think we have a lunch break now
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936 so that is a good thing
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139 okay
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775 of een opgebreider uit usual interface of iets
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117 for the technical functions of it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658 um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215 i think we must use the general functions of the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0059215_0060963 i have done a little research on the internet and not much information about it about the interface
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113 yeah i have been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844 so you have got a lot of devices like dvd television stereo
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948 so bad
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317 but it must be used frequently
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041 dus je kunt veel functies in één
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588 everyone remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064588_0064676 but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479 um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318 it is got many functions in one remote control but you can see this is a quite simple remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014 few buttons but this remote control got a lot of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502 people do not like it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347 what i was thinking about was keeping general functions like ar
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665 like the on and off button
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974 keep it like red bird
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596 en iedereen weet het dus je moet dat niet veranderen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183 personal preferences
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706 gebruik het display voor speciale functies van het verschillende apparaat
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070706_0070792 so um
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491 what i was thinking about was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217 this is the remote controller you got here the general functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145 like the on off button sound i do not know here you have got a kind of display
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438 this is a touch screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074438_0075919 so you have got a general function of the device for a dvd player so for playing reverse say that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452 we have got here real buttons for selecting a device
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0076586_0078034 dus deze knoppen voor de dv of voor elke app heb je een aparte display of aparte knoppen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621 dus je hebt nooit alle knoppen van een app
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045 so that is my idea about it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323 um yeah and
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706 uh let us see
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945 so that is good
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395 en de real buttons we hebben te gebruiken
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994 we moeten veel meer voordelen gebruiken
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294 iedereen moet het gebruiken dus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664 van ouders en jongeren
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268 so we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577 so um
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082833_0082896 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237 dat was mijn korte filmpje
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427 i do not think so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751 you got quite a cheap touch screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069 it is not a corridor or something
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648 it is just one call yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683 i have seen something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961 you got it quite
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685 kind of a touch screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287 twenty euro is of minder
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515 so it is buzz mob
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0089662_0089761 yeah it is really
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395 deaf people need data text for subtitles
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506 so it is yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0150585_0150660 for elderly people
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617 i mean it for tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713 we can not skip this place so we do not need it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000 i am going to turn it to left
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0018276_0018355 i think i will go first
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813 my name is freck
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965 thank you mark thanks for your time
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091 no gracias
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426 i have done some research
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302 we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observe users operating remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556 we let them fill out a questionnaire
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822 we had one hundred of these test subjects
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220 in addition we did some market research
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526 see what the market consists of
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664 what ages are involved
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460 well these are three quite astonishing results i thought
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753 remote is being considered ugly
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963 seventy five percent of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633 people question indicated that they thought their remote were on the side lead
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285 an additional eighty percent indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733 in addition remote run ups are very functional
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332 fifty percent of the people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons on the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939 and fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028233_0028307 soliftenir
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894 then we did some research to the most relevant functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664 channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867 the power button goes to nine
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117 and ten effects go to six and a half
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222 so these are the most
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700 most important functions of a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927 then there are some one time use functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087 that is what i like to call them
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550 there are the audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074 which are not really used very frequently but are still considered to be of some importance
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702 channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943 one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502 and these are the this is the market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115 sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty six
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874 the main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical under remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285 they like to use new functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438 but they also are very critical
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637 they will not spend their money very easily
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423 the users of forty six to sixty five years they make up forty percent of the market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731 they are not really very interested in features
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997 but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811 well i think this indicates where
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336 i think we should make a remote for the future
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480 and this means we would
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984 i have to focus on the ages sixteen to forty five
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938 this also makes the biggest part of the market so that will also be where our main profit will be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342 this would mean we would have to make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614 the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioning thought that remote control caused errors
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217 this is certainly something to take into account
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921 and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn how to operate a new remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379 so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672 besides of course that the remote must look very nice
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933 functionality
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727 as a lot of people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons i think we should make very few buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175 this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670 i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162 especially the channel selection or audio selection buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539 because they are used most and so they should be robust
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695 they should not break down easily
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851 then as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room it might be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678 rwyn meddwl bod yna oherwydd bod hynnyn gwybod yn gwybod y gwasanaethaun bwysig
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985 but it might be a good idea to make a docking station
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629 and this would get a button in it which would send the signal to the remote which would then beep
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890 so you know where it is in the room
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392 and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0050571_0051711 then a surprisingly great deal of people would have indicated that an lcd screen in the remote control would be preferred
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826 this was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436 mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805 but up to forty five it remains feasible
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574 this would also greatly increase the production cost but i think these are just some small factors we could consider
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0053859_0053925 that would be all
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0054420_0054490 questions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050 yes good top beneath
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058050_0058150 слышу
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058150_0058187 yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837 well we certainly make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089544_0089606 that is true
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819 we can do that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796 so is there any discussion possible about any project requirements
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896 because you are you are saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it is not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197 and new tv is will have internet access on them
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863 but i think if you are targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a tv with internet access
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278 within the next like twenty years is very slim
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133 in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543 so i think it is pretty dumb to put no tilted text feature on it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840 i am pretty much against it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878 besides that i think the market for forty plus is like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123983_0124063 pretty small
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873 but i think we are just going to go for another
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439 we cannot innovative
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125565_0125638 i think we can do a little bit more
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298 yes but it is not the biggest part of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973 besides that they are not very critical so i mean they do not really care
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315 what the remote control is like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688 they will just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961 i think that would be the case in the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414 sixteen to forty five age category
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077 because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605 people are forty plus i mean they wanted to work but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976 as soon as it works it is okay with them
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610 if we make a remark
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275 but obviously the board tends to disagree
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146351_0146443 so
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971 i was thinking it would definitely be a bad idea not to include them in the text
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038 i do not think that is really an issue anymore
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154163_0154263 might be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858 i mean if it is only for tv you are not going to need a lot of buttons anyway
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329 you need the one to zero button next channel previous channel
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821 up down and some teletext buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360 do you need a wig
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508 you are gonna include tell it actually do
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740 i think many people like to use that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506 if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five you do not want to push the next channel button five times
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525 that is true but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089 i do not think there are many tv is that can switch channels that fast
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238 and so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899 the tv would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220 i do not know if many channels
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162420_0162508 i do have them
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612 rhaid i chi ddweud yw hynny
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063 but i think i think if you are gonna make remote control only to operate a tv there is not much you can gain on
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497 having a few buttons as possible
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313 because i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a tv which already only have the minimum number of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540 i do not think there is much to be gained in that area
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001 that is true but i think there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only to operate only the tv
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897 if you have a remote control only to operate a tv there is simply not a lot of buttons required
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553 there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184 so i think it will be very hard to actually gain on the competition here
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602 it would cost a big marketing
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173040_0173099 which was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663 one of the arguments to make it only for the tv because we did not have the time to market a lot
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845 rwyn credu rwyn credu mae angen gwybodaeth dda i gysylltur llwybr
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153 but i do not think we should spend very much time in that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428 yeah i think maybe we should do some research to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733 what other people like to have you know
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039 i would like to have extra in the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443 yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote control tend to get lost
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188 yeah that was what i suggested
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919 you have it on some phones too whichever docking station
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252 and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0184328_0184403 so you know where it is
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701 i think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355 and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928 it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which will explain a button if you press it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068 which would tell you what it does
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747 and it would not have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469 just a small screen of it too
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307 i do not know
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635 into the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437 i think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0201108_0201183 i think
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807 i think that would be if we should do something like that it would be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198 i think it would be really good for the image of the company
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681 and i think there would be good market for it
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211 still able to really bring an innovative product
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648 yeah to really
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196 i have to look into that a little more
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517 and with the little screen in it which explains the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794 i think it would be a lot easier to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113 adapted to different cultures
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0214713_0214775 that is good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673 de componenten zijn er
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321 for the energy source we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829 kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360 but if we choose for that option the docking station could become obsolete
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601 so i do not think it is really an option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583 for the casing the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing single or double curved casing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859 and it is really up to the design that we are gonna use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347 it does not imply any technical restrictions
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153 as a case supplement we could i thought of that later a rubber belt like anti slip
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677 for the buttons we can use plastic or rubber
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326 and the chipset it says simple here but it should be advanced because we are using an lcd screen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026 and as the trendwatcher presentation showed people like wood
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725 but it raises the price and does not really fit the image unless we would start two product lines
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913 vormschiet voor de vrouwtje abba
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554 uh kinetic energy source is rather fancy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817 but you can do better what you want
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047 i think we should discuss that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706 for the case the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523 and the chipset really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0091523_0091576 that is it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992 yeah there are four options
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273 you could use the basic normal battery
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436 a hand dynamo
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719 but i do not think that is really an option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113 you do not want to swing before you can watch television yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261 solar cells
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667 but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099667_0099767 or the kinetic energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754 you basically shake your remote and then it powers up
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101742_0101816 that it is true
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402 i do not have any informational pricing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632 felly roeddwn in mynd i weithior ddeunyddion yn y blaen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810 that would also go for the lcd screen then i guess
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165 a bit higher percentage
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714 and that is the best choice
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947 well there is not any choice there because we are using the display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100 it is gotta be advanced
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061 i do not know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305 i will have to research
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060 well the general like most older remotes are flat just straight
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699 and our manufacturing department can also do different single curved or double curved cases
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622 it would just only affect the form for svarov is i know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003 so it is really just up to the design department what we are going to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236 it does not really matter for the price or the functionality
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537 pick one you like
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534 i think we should start by choosing a case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785 because that is the basis of building them
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445 soon
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151 grab the flap guys
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358 from the side to right over there
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993 with a single curve so i am not really sure what they are gonna look like but i think it is something like this
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632 so this type should be better for you or better it should prevent a stray injury a bit
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274 and a double groove something like this i guess
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600 those are the three options we have
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185 it is more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it is always a bomb
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030 maybe you should just start on a blank page
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425 good afternoon
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837 should we is there a meeting already
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093 i hope you enjoyed your lunch
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346 that is the correct way
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602 um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309 three
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844 okay this is the second phase we are going to discuss today
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162 het is een constructuele design meten
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095 and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409 conceptual specification of design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622 and also trend watching
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580 these are hopefully the points you addressed in your presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215 first i will show you the agenda
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404 first the opening
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621 then we have three presentations
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142 after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concept
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383 are we going to make it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600 and then we are closing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800 about forty minutes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221 so let us get started
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747 did someone encounter any problems during the preparation
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182 twenty five
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011182_0011256 it is loose
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177 אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה אה
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469 these are the points we created
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758 new primers in the target market
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012758_0013769 the requirements are data text docking station audio signal small screen with some extra button information
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987 and we are going to use default materials
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661 does somebody have any comments on these requirements
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611 these are just things we thought of so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else just let me know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755 maybe you can work it out
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334 and we are going to target the sixty to eighty year old customers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402 so now everybody knows what we are doing i suggest let us get started with the presentations
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012 so you give the same line of this last time
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736 any questions about the trends
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365 okay i am going to turn these
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0091739_0091784 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432 so that brings us to the discussion about the cool sex
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825 so these are the points we have to discuss
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318 first
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021 i think we can talk about the energy source since that is
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908 has a pretty big influence on production price and image
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011 so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927 i think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077 yeah well i think it was true elderly people just like to have everything in place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773 and i do not think they like remote just laying everywhere in their rooms
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157 so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369 and also what you said
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186 you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964 but i think it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441 so you have a button on your docking station that you can push and then it starts beeping
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214 and then we can we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the channels
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396 i am wondering
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198 that is a good point
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477 good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791 easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961 i think that is a good point
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054 i personally think the lcd screen we want to use with the extra information i think nobody has anything against it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507 it is just some extra information and it is easy to ignore as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757 but if you do not want to use it you just do not use it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889 and yeah i think maybe we have to discard the voice work issue
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431 because it will increase cost significantly
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946 and i do not think it will be a lot easier to use as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372 so that brings us back to the energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126 if we do not have voice recognition it will not use a lot of energy to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356 so in that case we could use kinetic energy but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466 that much cheaper as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353 okay and we just choose for the battery
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484 that brings us to the chip
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847 we are using the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465 okay that is it first chip
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455 and then we get to the point of the case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119 um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652 if you want to choose for wood or the black and grey
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732 or both
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723 and as we saw there is not wood is a lot more expensive to produce
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033 but i think it will attract elderly people who want to have something exclusive which they can show off to their grandkids
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275 got a new remote controller
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399 that is right
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850 but wood color was a lot more expensive
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038 you do not know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515 i think
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064 it is a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896 sydd yn y cysylltiadau
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794 i think that is a very good option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768 because they can advertise as well with the give your grandfather a new place for his remote control or whatever
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796 because that is something extra it is something other remotes do not have which we can get a greater advantage
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959 so and then you can make them with color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145 black and grey as well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770 so you suggest we should design two different telephones
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830 on which you can apply different case covers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767 so everybody is okay with the changing covers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059 i think that is a good option
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555 in questo caso
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318 but the form has to be
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677 it has to be possible to stand up
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912 orada sadece
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416 and the cover of the docking station is also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749 on to był w telewizji
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158749_0158792 i do not know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180 yeah you can do that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369 it is okay
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722 so the interface
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048 what type of interface do we want to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709 maybe we can make a little drawing of it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144 on the board
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381 somebody have ideas for a forum or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252 maer ffusion fwy fwy o ddifordd
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349 but you have extra business
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495 so people can get confused
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086 yn y cyfle hwnnw
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234 can not we make a remote which you can flip over and use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173340_0173417 on the same
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789 functions as the normal one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194 then yes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398 thanks
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292 and good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482 yes it is great
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107 uh what is the thing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553 it is the first time i have been here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069 no it is not very handy i think
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520 because the plasma mean will be up a slope
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813 no it is not here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100 i guess
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349 maybe not
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117 but is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262 i think the features are
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981 that basic that nobody should have any problems with yeah choosing channel that is true
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589 so so well
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961 i think we can just leave it in normal shape
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365 but maybe we have to
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783 make it a bit more fancy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988 in another way
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404 soon
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709 i suggest the single curve because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514 so that other people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759 because it is a bit of an angle
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0197954_0198030 i think so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198497_0198586 давайте
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153 do you have an upside down or that is a top
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581 so get your buzz
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961 that is a good move
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386 but i think it is better to put the screen on top
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339 so just flip it one hundred and eighty degrees around
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592 if you can add this one you turn it like this
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761 good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490 because maybe your hand is in the way if you get out of here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207860_0207900 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208151_0208188 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288 start on a black page
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838 that is good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509 here this way
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175 and we can little bit of here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421 just that square left
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958 and then the rest of the business
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498 yes
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344 a little bit more friendly
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215951_0216031 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423 that is what it was
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512 we have got a general idea of the concepts and materials we are going to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081 so now for the next meeting we will have to look at the field design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575 it is important that the corporate design image is going to be in remote
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819 so check out the corporate website maybe
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286 the user interface design is the same sorry
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527 and product evaluation
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198 so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771 but you are going to get your instructions i think send bloody gudge
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642 so i will put these minutes in the folder
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0221860_0223007 en dan gaan we proberen ons project te afleggen en een goed ontwerp maken voor alle grondvader en grondmaternen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394 det er til røven
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233 i am not sure if you are going to start right away to work together or i think you are going to fill in the questionnaires first
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361 and then you will get a message
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778 så lidt så det er sgu ikke
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026 maybe this one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240 okay say please well i mean the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225592_0225685 ffônwch ychydig
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653 all right let us see here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788 smart boy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235 so if you want to look at it it is over there in the project folder
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764 and then i guess we will start in thirty minutes again
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227926_0228011 thank you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943 mm hmm
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820 um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237 some research about the shining of interface
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969 in de laatste meting hebben we een paar bitten gebruikt
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534 so that is what i want to
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088 through our design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675 it is a very attractive way to control the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406 i found something about speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725 so maybe we can use that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241 and using a little display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584 so um find
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263 just to focus on the primary functions
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0052279_0053386 so only buttons for sound or on off shifting up channel or down shifting down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794 let us see
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930 um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0054053_0055076 we hebben nog wat nieuwe en attractieve functies nodig die mensen voor het gebruiken attractief zijn
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904 so it is like a speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247 just as we mentioned last meeting
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736 en ja overal je is een francie
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079 dus gebruik de grote knoppen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127 it is possible to make a quite cheap system for speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078 when you lost your remote control you can call it and it will give you a signal
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315 so yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059355_0060394 and for shifting up a channel or for putting out the sound or something
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972 you can just give a sign say sound off or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248 and uh
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666 the television put the sound of
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061979_0062017 see you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062017_0062107 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754 i was thinking about a special button for subtitles just one button to keep it simple
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187 als je een push op de knop heeft krijg je kleine zettingen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204 double push push double click so you get big subtitles for people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965 hoe kan je een klein stukje tekenen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167 so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977 ja we moeten de beton in de generale toegang houden
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608 the on and off sound on and off sound higher and lower and the numbers zero to nine
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499 and the general button more general one button for shifting up shifting down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0067499_0068547 also we want to use a little display for displaying the functions of the buttons
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546 we kunnen een functie bouwen die de tv channel of de tv channel laten zien
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161 so a little picture of it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824 just you can put on off button over here in this corner
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571 bijna alle remote controles gebruiken we een afstands kant op deze plek
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271 dus mensen kunnen de knop erin herkennen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416 so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043 display of it just a small display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312 again put it on top of the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615 uh it is the most uh
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199 places en mensen de meeste mensen zijn van luxe
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041 so special button for shifting up and shifting down channel
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585 om het lezen van de dame of de
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038 so you can easily shift up or shift down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404 and it is quite a
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077560_0077623 any place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316 and other functions for subtitles one with for sound
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304 en overal design we moeten het over het vormen van het
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573 that is it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0103973_0104066 what is the function
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374 for loading up the batteries
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104502_0104541 we hebben het
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864 okay but i will not use much energy i believe
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811 it is just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or more
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293 so i believe one battery is just enough
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0107293_0107332 so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0109111_0109182 place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0122010_0123074 maar we hebben hier een grote lcd display of een kleine die we willen gebruiken
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359 i do not know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497 it is possible to make a changeable case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140497_0141783 so you got mobile phones like nokia mobile phones when you can change the case of it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143 maybe it is a possibility
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0142143_0143382 so you have just to make one standard remote control and you can sell a few
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139 we can just use the regular form of it but it is not quite fancy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0162139_0162213 show
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324 for left handed users
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165576_0165671 yeah we
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715 it is possible to program it so you can on the left side or on the right side buttons for shifting events
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669 en op de andere kant de knoppen om de geluid te schiften
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929 um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0168784_0168851 is a fuse of
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0171079_0171166 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417 let us see
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825 or you have to make a left
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980 i mean um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0174074_0174165 that you have
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0181030_0181088 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486 just using a
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687 ja
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832 yeah building
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195579_0195663 this is what i am testing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040 you say it is um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266 uh
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849 so you want to put this way over here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953 no
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945 now it is they have an upside down or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055 いいですねーと
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194 wissen sie das ist es doch
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199194_0199283 is out
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043 maybe it is possible to make this site like
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428 
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425 to make this site
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850 welcome
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217 so in the form of your hands
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202217_0202304 so uh
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202446_0202545 that is
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157 so the remote controller has to lay in your hands
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536 so it is possible
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151 and the buttons for
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620 changing the channel over here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644 so just flip it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150 able to display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060 i do not know man
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061 like on your mobile phone
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875 aufnehmen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463 maar de on off betten still on the top
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0002409_0002464 especially
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300 i will start off with a good look
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995 i am going to inform you about the trend watching on the past few days
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224 we have done some work research
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610 can you distribute it some more on kids questionnaires
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021670_0022728 besides that i deployed some trend watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525 and i have consulted some additional trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088 the best design would be
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509 okay these are some overall findings
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960 the most important thing is the fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462 the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239 maer gwybodaeth yma wedi bod yn dda iawn or ddau ffansiwn
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776 by innovative this means functions which are not featured in other remote controllers
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839 about half of how important the innovativeness was was easy to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0027839_0029193 for our group we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty years old these factors are slightly more equal
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830 these are some more group specific findings
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102 the older people prefer dark colors
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533 they like recognizable shapes and familiar material
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093 our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633 the material for older people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031633_0032764 maer ffyniad hwn yn rhoir amser am y ffyniad y maer ffyniad yn ei ffyniad
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520 maen mynd i ni i ddod o ffyrdd perfformiol
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933 the remote control and the docking station should blend in
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226 in the room
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797 felly dynar hyn syn mynd ir adeiladaun oed
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557 just keep it simple and docking station on the small screen would be your main points of interest
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270 because this would be the innovativeness in the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896 so this would be very important that we at least include these features
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036896_0037901 maer cyhoeddus tronf yn ymwneudol ar gwasanaeth yma ar gyfer ymwneudol ar stafion ddod yn ddaeth ymwneudol
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470 so you could imagine that the remote control would be standing up straight in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085 this is pretty much a new shape to older people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958 also they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170 so it would be kind of more telephone shaped
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0040266_0041314 besides that we would advise to bring two editions one with a wood like colour and maybe a few and one with a grey black colour
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809 who would like for more exclusive people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998 people with more money
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227 the great black color for
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730 people of less means
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203 there would be
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043635_0043711 the tris
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370 and how exactly does the kinetic energy work
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100370_0100424 just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747 your repo and then it powers up
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706 well personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499 besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267 and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559 get great popularity for a product
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007 um what is
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196 yeah you could load up batteries you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720 this is true elderly people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954 i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557 because in our earlier market research if you would allow me to yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235 so it is open here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594 we also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369 if people would pay more for speed recognition and no remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827 well you can see here our darker group would not do that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229 so if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote controller
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667 rwyn hoffin ddiddordeb yn dda iw wneud
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175 i think it would be better to insert in our other product that is meant for that
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0118321_0118391 younger people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924 um well this is yeah but this is here the question was would you prefer it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250 so that does not really mean they would not pay extra for it
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970 and on top of that the lcd screen would help in making the remote control easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773 and i think the voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744 well this was for like an lcd screen like you would have on a mobile phone
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971 so pretty large
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803 i think the most important factor there is the wooden color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136 so it would actually have to be would yeah it is just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0138485_0138558 mood color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574 you get a great advantage
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670 we would have to look carefully into the design though
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517 because we would have to make one more control which would fit in with a wooden cover and the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798 plastic cover
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153 the more original one the more standard one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355 yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184 oh you can not write on the phone
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094 well no i think we should just we should then just design one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867 one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305 so but that should not be too much of a problem
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151 i heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curve yes yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312 could you explain it a little more
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954 and what would single curves and double curves mean
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539 so we can pretty much just pick one
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156788_0156823 that is good
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967 no just to lay down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229 the cover of the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889 و لا أربط شعب ذكي
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200 you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you could yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156 so your thumb would be easily well i think that is a very good point because i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause rsi
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342 felly byddain dda iawn i hynny
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900 i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355 for left handed users
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860 amen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985 um well look
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721 yeah we could do that but i am not sure if that would be very good for the easy ease of use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0169396_0170527 but if we would make changing channels and changing volume button on both sides that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940 because it could be made all symmetrical and stuff
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0171552_0171617 that is true
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0183930_0184002 that is true
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919 i prefer the corners to be round
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215101_0215191 kingdom of the unfinished
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215435_0215516 on the on the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0227946_0227988 okay good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318 well this is what me and richard came up with
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630 the default spot for the on off button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914 the new button just below that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143 then there is the volume and channel selectors
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651 simple plus minus
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832 we thought of a help button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459 if you hold it and you press another button the help goes to the lcd screen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006 then there is the zero to one to zero buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210 button for teletext
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412 looking for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547 en de company logo
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108 so it is rather simple prototype
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509 and we will have to see from testing how the users take it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603 sure
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857 i think if you look at
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312 most controls they have got more buttons than this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651 well the on off button is a necessity
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827 can you open up that one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305 volume and channel buttons you obviously need to have those
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014 de mute knop kan worden vervangd door het drukken van de folie naar beneden
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295 so we could castle that one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198 i think the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796 well good times
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107 i am gonna leave out the number buttons i guess
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775 so it is rather basic already
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707 yeah there is a lot of white water
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038707_0039817 they are supposed to be equal sized with a little logo on it for the volume
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922 just for recognition
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860 so for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160 with a different colour than the case
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326 so di diwmpa
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672 okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531 i think it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589 if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402 which is not the docking station is not even in this schematic
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799 no it is not even taken into the press
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439 you could save money on it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909 but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432 my mother can not even send an sms message
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716 the margins are getting too small
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859 no any other remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535 we are getting closer
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608 you could just not scroll for half a second
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041 if you want to use an lcd screen you need an advanced chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942 yeah if we could just leave out one more button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104845_0104933 uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706 what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015 eight hundred and eighty eight
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125 je kunt er twee knoppen uit maken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299 and just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820 if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160 zo dat we two knoppen kunnen versterken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291 if you do the same for the challenge
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0125541_0125614 more obvious
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0127499_0127588 sorry for the noise
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190 if we leave out all those buttons perhaps we can go with the flat case
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350 and make it smaller overall
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493 so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button the screen right under that then the scroll button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801 you will get a much smaller remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131028_0131056 and
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171 richard argument but all these changes are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0173211_0173289 the llf five
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147 i have not sort of had one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014 i think that is a free
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412 i think it is too fancy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585 to the issue
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806 is this like after this will be done or
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0199991_0200038 that is it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434 yeah there was not enough room for true finance
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207148_0207215 yeah this was not good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687 the tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step and it is very easy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414 the drawing is just a paint in the end
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773 they did not look very nice
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110 to flip over more precisely
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0214261_0214361 i think it is a monster as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0217626_0217690 good work
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023 considering we are not going to make a documentation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0002698_0002756 no problem
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551 това е възможно
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665 starts at three oclock
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450 are fourth and last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004774_0004870 there he is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801 it is our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236 in this meeting we will discuss our final design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073 and we will do some evaluation about not only the product but also the project
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473 and then we are going to close the project today as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027 so after that you will be free to go and spend all your money
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951 dit is een detail design meeting we gaan over de look en de gevoel van het design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616 the usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053 in order to go to this agenda
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431 we will have the prototype presentation first
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847 then we will set up some evaluation criteria
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128 then we will look at the finance
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851 we will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264 everything costs money and the more features you want to have the more money it will cost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897 so we will see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106 we will see that later
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608 then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797 we have got forty minutes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313 so we will be finished at half past three
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458 but first
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059 we will do the what is that presentation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536 to some attributes for it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033 but i thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364 just a few buttons and large buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914 but i think these are altogether quite a few buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558 i am wondering if we really need all of those buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0030283_0030338 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008 long time yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0034073_0034143 right good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567 the titles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300 so yeah it is somebody but something about the design of the buttons there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660 é não é meu plano
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042770_0042859 it is not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583 then because we only have thirty minutes left i will move on to the finance part
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103 which is pretty exciting to see if it is all possible what we want to do
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313 and i can tell you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184 that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve point five euros
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093 if we see i do not know if i filmed it correctly so just correct me if you see something wrong
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275 i got two batteries
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449 but maybe we can also use one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571 i do not know if it is supposed to be
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046688_0046778 das wird schon
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046778_0046829 the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569 it is two euros up
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771 we need the advance chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964 соряю обначил
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445 save there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674 here we have the single curves
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330 we can see the difference between uncurved and single curved is one euro
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0049567_0050630 i do not know but i think the single curve is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771 i think we have to keep the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207 then we have the case material supplements
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051207_0051288 it is plastic
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551 that is the cheapest one we need
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892 so that is not much to say either
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253 but then the biggest cost are the buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124 so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our calls low
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846 oherwydd byddwn yn rhaid iw gael twelve point five euro ar y cyfnod
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498 so let us first go on the buttons we have now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741 sixteen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171 that will be even more than
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282 eight zero zero zero
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363 okay including the health
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577 i am sorry
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973 i think we can discard the help and the mute button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577 by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157 dat zegt zes wang je wel alweer
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347 is that a good fifteen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058911_0059003 and this is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638 i do not know if i should want to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761 yeah but it is not stated in this it is just a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582 so maybe we can even make one button with the volume and channel in one by pressing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189 that is a possibility as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747 so and it is good for the design as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063747_0063844 you can make
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253 let us see
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373 okay there it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283 it looks good right there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604 crowd
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938 so uh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067938_0067994 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755 i think they count the material
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434 on the chip there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069640_0069710 uh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069710_0069759 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476 but i think because we have the advantage we can just count this as one bit
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612 but not with that thing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110 maybe it is but then it seems to me that it is impossible to get yourself an half euro
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807 also the lc display i think it is too expensive for the display we use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166 i think they tried
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535 that is right that is the biggest advantage of our remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858 taken into the press
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075858_0075946 that is excellent
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075946_0075992 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577 that is an option
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108 close
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625 do not you think we can if we can count this as one button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335 and integrate these buttons in three that is a lot of money as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0079648_0079729 it is a clip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216 yeah but we have to stick with it till often all of you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758 we do not have any more budget the margin will get too small
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085451_0085521 it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913 if you would be able to see the display
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188 and if you use less buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824 i can not use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445 there it is yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876 it did not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0088391_0088466 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850 i think it is difficult as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606 or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091774_0091815 for this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155 cause that is not we save
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604 ten five four
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797 see you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082 that is it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674 we are getting closer
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454 감사합니다
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956 oh maybe you can
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416 scroll
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856 if you scroll you will see the numbers on the lcd display
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061 you tell your head of the right number then you push it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800 push button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289 okay but then you can push some other business
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097773_0097811 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288 you wait a half second
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412 maen rhaid i ni gwneud yn y ffordd
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634 and be better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440 and the regular chip is not possible
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541 het is de b twelve
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028 you need an advanced chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674 and we can save a euro by a flat design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510 that is an option we can then we are almost there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103221_0103313 felly y fydd
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097 yeah but i think that is that is a big advantage
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780 can we integrate the data text and the subtitles in one button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181 thank you pretty much
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035 well it could be
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0110185_0111458 ik denk dat als je een goed advertentie maakt op tv en in de guide je kunt de mensen uitleggen hoe ze de schoorwiel gebruiken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738 just make it real simple
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275 it saves a lot of money
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622 and we can keep our lcd screen which can provide extra information
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798 a sut ydych chin gweithio ar y ddwylo
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097 i think that is the only good bit is s shit titles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870 dit is goed voor de innovative design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054 if you would erase
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455 
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936 i am excited
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970 it looks a bit off maybe
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0118202_0118283 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389 something like that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627 and yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119627_0119725 okay so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301 one two three four five
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659 desde que tudo essa isso
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704 that is really a good idea i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742 en dat zal het gebruik van de scrollwielgebleven maken gebleven inderdaad
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440 so we make one and volume one two three four
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540 so if you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127540_0127616 right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873 so we have got one two three
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246 yeah we can leave the data text in if we want
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484 that is my show today
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0129528_0129580 so if you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130183_0130236 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130848_0130903 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131141_0131200 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599 i am going to be pleased to see the difference
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0132777_0132865 you only have
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891 it is more the models in which they are being made i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149 single current is really easy to just fill in
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440 and then the case has gone right out of the machine
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932 and seeing the gertrude is and different machine
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349 i think this is a really easy one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204 what does everybody think about a flap or a single curve
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368 okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976 yes it does
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138075_0138134 yeah i know
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138448_0138544 καίρις
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061 i am going to do some more research
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867 but i think we can keep the single carat long
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423 just to express our lcd screen a bit more
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234 some people will use it more and especially for the help functions it will be good if we have scroll bar scroll button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583 will be necessary if we have good health issues as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553 school
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030 i think it was better to have this price a bit earlier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412 yes definitely
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852 i am glad we could make this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487 that is pretty different
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0146301_0146358 to get
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692 yeah so we are gonna
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147824_0147921 i think the most
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713 en zo
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057 we can maybe stick it out
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480 like an old old button yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709 maybe that is recognizable for them as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882 that is a good one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380 so i am afraid we have to move on
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789 it is less frightening i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461 if they see this design and think of only five buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0151710_0151804 he would be like what
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752 i would buy it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952 today
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182 i would buy a defences
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385 i do not know
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583 i would have guessed it is up in all viewers
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939 yes they are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590 that we can go with the project evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070 that is it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185 i can sit down
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519 we still have fifteen minutes left so it is nice with schedule
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017 the project process
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654 evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0156703 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972 dat was de dingetje dat point heb ik vergad
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157073_0157148 чё
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416 gabriel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938 good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406 we have got five minutes i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595 no we have got fifteen minutes but no
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0159654_0159733 yes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0160899_0160939 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947 yeah that is because my pen failed to upload this data
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409 ‫אני קורא ‫אבל זה נגיד שמי ‫הוא נגדל שמי
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151 i think it is vincent
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912 subtitles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763 so we have got twenty cents for our docking station
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172007_0172054 it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577 there it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279 i would say four or five
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431 four hundred and five
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173431_0173528 between four
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0174139_0174236 is it finishing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410 i think it is seven
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373 nice balls
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514 i have been worked out
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276 they are ugly not very functional and getting lost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496 i think with the new radio button i think it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180601_0180679 i think it is better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0181167_0181228 되게
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495 that would give us a four
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543 then we have to do it in three
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656 it is good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737 yes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657 they want to put fashion in their products
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820 in the slogan of the company
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250 i think we have the removable front cases
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526 felly dwin credu bod hynnyn bwysig
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302 we have got to go
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159 we are going to evaluate
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159 forty nine
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0191694_0191750 what do you want
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723 i am going to eighty percent
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192723_0192769 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734 does eighty four percent
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531 i think that is a pretty nice score
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196264_0196309 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091 that brings us to the project evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969 project process
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284 did we move through the right faces you think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0198284_0198384 long process
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199215_0199260 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792 so lack of information about prices
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462 what is the room for creativity
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171 because of the finance she
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519 the rumors
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092 internet access
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292 was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819 did it work out
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206819_0206916 working together
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281 also you to view with the yeah it was okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665 were insufficient for the tasks that we had to do
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854 or really too much
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210536_0210617 why did not i do it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227 if it wants to download this data
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923 
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719 smartboard was irritating
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663 so you rather want to have a flip over
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862 or something like that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403 fortsætter vi svarer
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214952_0215006 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117 you need the smart board application i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463 but i keep
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606 should be equal
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760 yeah you can export this image
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036 missed
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673 so the sharing of information was okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973 that is right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141 ja ik ben eens hier aan de tijd
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0221553_0221616 it is possible
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160 it is nice
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383 have we found new ideas for
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719 having this kind of meetings
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853 so everybody puts his own score
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438 yeah it mediates the score yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629 that is better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773 so it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226902_0226980 very cool
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875 any more ideas
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035 questions about the project
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187 about the product
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027 it goes i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842 then let us get to our last sheet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225 articles in the budget
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759 considering we are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184 w stage
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323 that is it boy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942 maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459 i think you can compensate that as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053 so i think that should not be the biggest problem because it is very cheap to make as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536 do we think we are gonna get the twelve and all million
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728 how old was he fifteen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002 christine christine miller
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226 i think he will
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421 are you going to exploit this product
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631 ja in overte
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796 especially in america
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996 people are they could have
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923 and even more for the younger people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789 just put it on the market for everybody
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421 you can change markets by changing the flow of coffee
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648 that is true
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492 so you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the mark
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596 just as a test
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780 see how it works
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960 that is why i think it is fun
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889 then i think we can go to the celebration
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243008_0243104 party
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641 i think we still have to put in more
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243641_0243727 let us see
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243727_0243778 i do not know
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907 i did not get the message
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644 from the ending of the ablique
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766 five more minutes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244766_0244857 okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441 then we still have some questions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777 if somebody has some questions they can ask them now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188 we can put these in the project folder as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0246188_0246256 mm hmm
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137 explore the universe picture i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996 this is another
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380 so you see the project cooler
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0251380_0251450 favor
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252084_0252182 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073 i think i am going to make our final presentation now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994 and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292 summary of the project
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455 i think you all got the question in your room
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867 and then i will meet you in i think about ten minutes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257911_0257969 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676 i think my pen will download this software
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258798_0258869 for the day
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520 it is just the normal remote controls
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092 you came in page one hundred
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492 you can use the normal one   zero buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251 but you can also use the bottom for changing the channel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597 so the shifting button okay
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145 voor shifting up in detail text en shifting down
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0028020_0028081 manchester
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0032664_0032723 yes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076 or you can build it when you press one button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430 we discussed that already
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841 but we think all people do not know that option
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336 so they just put in the press the bell on
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0036106_0036142 mm hmm
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0038595_0038650 아예 좋고
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039621_0039712 i am going to try
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870 just to recognise it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252 and we do not need led or led
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216 some remote controls do it but because we use the little display we do not have to use it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353 yeah so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989 jéé jesli
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640 go to heaven
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055647_0055737 fifteen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074 yeah with the alt button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059797_0059890 i think there are two buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170 see on vain kõik
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336 bit
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809 to one big boom
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278 but they are more expensive than the small ones
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447 i
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922 it is just a reference
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814 but i do not know if it is cheaper
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508 so we still got four buttons but just so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393 you got not a better itself but on the chip
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825 the chip you have got still for business
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0070187_0070270 yeah but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323 we can buy a remote control when you can use it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080323_0080403 so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080795_0081905 we eh we must eh stay below the eh below eh twelve fifteen or yeah yeah can not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675 this is a good tool
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308 it is possible to make one for twelve fifty
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0085405_0085486 i do not think so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769 but i can not use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698 so you want to make a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326 fancy en
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709 with the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083 attractive options
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571 dus je kunt eronder blijven tot fifty
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862 let us go to this one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091964_0092017 is not that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725 да что то
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0102171_0102209 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643 of we moeten de subtitel afschuiven
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896 i think that is it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203 yeah it is a big advantage
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445 but it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104854_0104924 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420 maar even je oppoes de tijd is om de rest te wijten
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106593_0106649 the page a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180 one but a few
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0130811_0130845 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737 but you can make a quite big remote control for just the same price as a small one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154 you only have to pay for the bubble curve or single curve
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0144166_0144215 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881 good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245 but they know the scroll buttons from old radios
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690 also buttons like that for changing channels
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848 so again maybe it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341 that is very special so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0169428_0169515 see you all go for a second
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172293_0172354 there it is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113 for all people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379 four hundred and five
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0174813_0174866 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045 there you go
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054 that is a free
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961 we moeten het zo even testen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151 네 그렇죠
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0183216_0183313 thank you for your time
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0184600_0184659 yes
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0198655_0198706 jai pas découte
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034 for brisbane sure
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998 but if you want to share a picture like this on the presentation
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302 it is easier to share it with other people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688 so you can save it and put it on the internet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321 or in shared folder or shared directory
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617 my legs are but no
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571 can you export it like a should be possible
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221557_0221619 possible
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0222830_0223899 yeah maybe let me just give the numbers of
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0224017_0225098 it is easier to do things like that on the computer
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564 so just like university
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0232341_0232375 yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0243410_0243496 graças a ti meu amigo
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498 أهبني
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875 maybe they will save it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252875_0252954 so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986 maybe we have to fill another question in
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256986_0257044 yeah i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471 that is me
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765 sorry i am a little late no problem
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891 got second traffic
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337 um is this the moment where we ask we are gonna ask questions about the functionality
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526 when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you go to the next teletext page
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009 i think so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127 that is what i pointed out earlier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580 if you just make a control for just the tv there is just not much to gain
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624 seems to be rechargeable
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604 удом
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058664_0058737 pois é
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435 i assume the volume and channel thing is for two buttons each right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016 i think i did a two buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891 well i was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402 that would cut the cost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849 i think this really is for button turning
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689 only the docking station of this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247 then we should move to a different supplier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213 ma è muore caldo
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340 well since the market research
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439 indicated that older people spend their money easier more easy maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715 特elijk omdat we die mooie features hebben
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761 if you need a display
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089659_0089691 for watching
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089831_0090913 basically it becomes a choice between either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017 but how would a scroll wheel work here
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447 dat zou de prijs van de school brengen
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836 push button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096836_0096923 but then you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523 i think that would be like the end of our usability
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0099189_0099267 yeah but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892 i think it is pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button go to page eight hundred and eighty eight yeah and teletext disappears
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058 but sometimes it will stay there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387 dus die heeft eerst een bunt ons gewijst
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498 i could be one but a few scroll to eight click scroll to eight click scroll to eight click
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376 but then again there would be just pretty much normal option for other people who do not even know what a scroll wheel is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108535_0108604 holy god
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349 remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761 with only five buttons on it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109976_0110054 and it is cool to you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143 it is a pretty big school
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621 so this is five
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884 right now we are fine
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803 well i still think we should go for the single curve design
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008 yeah then again i am really sorry
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451 all these changes are not really okay with me
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601 but since
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137769_0137865 i just have to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255 i would rather just go to the board and
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782 get us a eighteen dollars remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228 do some market research and see what the options are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362 it is pretty good
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959 this is not really like for the group you were making
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152 this will really require a lot of marketing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482 to get this to sell
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297 because older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426 this is not familiar for them
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830 we are going to have to do a lot of convincing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151389_0151436 это что
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580 might be confusing too
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151720_0151805 could be like what
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906 only five buttons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944 but you are not sixty
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394 so i like set up all these criteria
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642 a very rich validation of the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865 okay so i did some literature study analysis of the requirement we set up earlier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347 translated into criteria which would be these
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584 this is remote fancy
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756 de shape is erop
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137 what new functions are on there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162137_0162232 easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741 learnability is a very important factor
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952 it is functional
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317 are there not too many functions or the amount of functions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740 and those functions in darya are they useful
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163740_0163825 and the cost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164080_0164162 the target group
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617 is de remote echt voor de groep die we het voor maken
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998 and record mobility
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536 if our company is easily recognizable our company made it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081 so we are supposed to evaluate it right now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166423_0166471 mbc 뉴스 김수근입니다
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260 i have to say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0167371_0167425 for an update
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001 this is designed fancy on a scale of one to seven
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635 zero point six six
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392 this is the design innovative
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929 maen dda in ddod or ffordd
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030 should we do one yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181 it is the design easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172780_0172879 would be for us
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0173579_0173666 i go for four too
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438 this is a design functional
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714 do we have all functions that we want to include
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174849_0174943 think we do
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151 do we have too many functions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175151_0175235 i do not think so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175235_0175320 pretty sure
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990 oh and do we
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676 take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833 welke ik ken in love
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301 i have not fought a good one nice boilers
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0177301_0177351 city
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770 production costs will increase at dates
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178770_0178849 it is really weird now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698 does the design fit the group of focus
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180138_0180230 i think we are the new
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180815_0180879 cest super
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181091_0181152 i think
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034 i think the radio button is not exactly what older people expect of remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0182989_0183036 i am not sure
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172 i think i can go for a cheat
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632 is it coming right now
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738 да
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139 so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762 i was also supposed to calculate the score but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353 we have got the code
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785 is this like after this are we done
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100 and then we go to sleep
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189254_0189335 bye
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567 these are sub effectors one hundred and seven s
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356 i am not sure
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964 thank you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191089_0191157 i am in a pinch phil
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499 so maybe minus eight
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834 forty one
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134 i guess we will just take the bottom part
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171 söğütü bir efl olmuş
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145 i think we should have had the finance thingy we got earlier
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442 in the design phase
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0201763_0201840 not too much
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202278_0202335 yeah true
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157 and i would have liked to go for that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420 younger users also
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833 and just to be able to access the internet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0204002_0204098 get something of your own
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573 i am trying to open the file on my laptop but
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217671_0217762 i am not pushing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219000_0219096 you should have done nothing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219812_0219863 do not shoot
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0232490_0232532 damn
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767 fifty
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237264_0237626 yeah i still do not think i mean if we are gonna make a scroll button anyway
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244 even more for the younger people than for the older people yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405 so maybe we should just refocus
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004 specifically for a good change
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0239502_0239563 that is true
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758 yeah i think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is do not be with
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0241921_0241996 full of people
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325 even if it were their covers
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121 party party
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0244479_0244521 how you doing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0253017_0253106 so i did not want to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515 you are supposed to nice
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688 are we supposed to go into our own rooms again
