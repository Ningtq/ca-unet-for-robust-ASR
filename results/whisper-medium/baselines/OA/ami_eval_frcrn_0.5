AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0001232_0001522 So, that's all we need to talk about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003404_0003804 There you go.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003804_0004372 Oh, I dropped mine as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0004372_0004550 This is a good start.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0014258_0014411 So that you can...

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0019299_0019342 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0020774_0021798 I guess the bottom makes a bit more sense, because otherwise you don't really know that... Oh, what if I right click now? What happens then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0021798_0022021 Well no, you still have the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0022494_0022568 Svůr...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0023119_0023309 But well, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0028511_0029029 I guess so. It's more like part of the...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029176_0029382 browsing sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029382_0029782 more than the speaking characterization as Steve mentioned.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029782_0030242 Yeah, it's really nice to have it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033387_0033423 I
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033648_0034102 I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034102_0034749 Well, if you get speed correction that someone talks a lot in a certain topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034749_0035495 and then if you click on that topic you get everything that's in that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035495_0035633 That's still another...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035885_0035950 No, no, no.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0047186_0047257 Like we have to...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048370_0048684 Like, I don't know, show the speaker characteristics.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048684_0048784 Ben de
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0049626_0050203 But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0050347_0050518 ちょっと待って
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0052255_0052654 Yeah.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054234_0054469 I'm getting the points on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054629_0054823 Yeah, once you're clean enough.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0064834_0065636 But currently, I mean, you probably, I don't know if you want to have the full transcription and the summary at the same time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0065756_0066343 So maybe you can just choose the same window for transcription and summary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066792_0066942 That's a nice.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071661_0071729 we can do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071903_0072556 No, no, it could be like transcription summary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0073967_0074082 Bu ne mıyım?

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079370_0079997 with transcripts sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079997_0080387 like full meeting, meeting without disabilities and summaries.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084663_0084719 I guess it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084719_0085603 I mean just to try and I mean for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing. Yeah that's what we need to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086073_0086473 just so see the integration where it's sort of between the two.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086888_0087101 So I guess that's what we need to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088004_0088628 Well, I guess, I mean, that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088628_0088867 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0094981_0095082 Say that again.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0100130_0101160 I started browsing a bit, just like, trying to see if there's anything out there to use.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101288_0101585 Yeah, it's so true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101585_0101685 and read files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101685_0101792 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101792_0102458 Okay, found a tutorial but it's in search indexing.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103473_0103608 I could have a look there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103608_0104072 But I found some code for like a tutorial about indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104072_0104133 Come on, cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104458_0104529 Yep.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106053_0106854 I was a bit worried about Owen. Well, when he talked about this with the file, with Norman Fowles.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106854_0107249 I mean, how much do we actually need to do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0107249_0107771 like extracting things from the XML files and stuff to be able to do the indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110119_0110483 Are you running in Jala? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110616_0110841 I mean you should look at the phone.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0113394_0114347 Yeah, I guess, I mean, it was a good point you had that like collaborating with Fowl
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0114347_0114848 I mean if you already started on this stuff, I guess we can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115519_0115636 Should we? I don't know.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128615_0128800 Or is it just what's behind it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128800_0129035 No, this is not the actual

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0180527_0180987 so we don't have to do all the work again, just figuring out stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0181391_0181684 Just like accessing the corpus and stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0185851_0185928 진짜?

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193935_0194028 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0195765_0196060 We could photocop your assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0196589_0196765 So what time do we say?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197137_0197220 after the event.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199088_0199348 Maybe it doesn't have to be.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199554_0199647 It's really neat.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199647_0200193 Should be. Is it really? Well, it's supposed to be.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200193_0200308 Really?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200554_0200596 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200596_0201020 We have one class at least when we use perception, we don't have any lectures.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201020_0201252 but I think we're having like all other classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201252_0201545 I don't think there was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202017_0202078 I think one of them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202348_0202617 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202617_0203004 I think the undergraduates had a word of...

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205048_0205523 Yeah. I guess that's it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205523_0205676 Was there anything else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205676_0206048 Do anyone want to take care of this or should I take care of it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206263_0206578 I don't know what's going on with my hair.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206578_0206731 I can't think basically said

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0207601_0208075 You want me to open it?

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005935_0006681 And then when you go on the menu, you can select the summarisation box which pops up and an audio player.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007975_0008475 Mae angen i chi ddod o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o'r cyfle o
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008648_0008707 That make sense?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008861_0009603 The transcription box has got a summarised button which doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0009603_0010391 Now, I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up window with the speaker characterisation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010620_0010958 Either we could do that, you know, when does the pop-up come up?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010958_0011582 either we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0011582_0012313 Or we can put an extra button, extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012838 Felly, gallwch chi ddysgu ar y botwm a yna mae'n hynny'n hynny, beth oedd yr holl cyfrifiad yw.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012838_0013481 The problem is the left click is already used because it highlights that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0013662_0014263 Mae'r cyfle hwn yn ymwneud ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014263_0014755 so that you can... I don't know what happens when you don't look like Ashley.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014755_0015291 But that would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015291_0015579 I think so yeah when you left click it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015579_0016074 gallwch, per example, adleu y marker yno i gael y audio yma, rwy'n credu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016268_0016434 So we can't put it on lefty
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016434_0016638 we could put it on the right click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016638_0016875 gallwn i, perthynas, gael y menyw sy'n mynd i'r gweithredu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0017064_0017669 So right click on a menu and you can click on speak for characterization.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018003_0018170 That's a good point.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018170_0018296 I love you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018296_0018364 So otherwise.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018512_0019136 Yeah, yeah, but I don't know about you, but usually in Windows, right click doesn't do anything, does it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019136_0019281 It opens a menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019281_0019509 Yeah, that's what I'm going to be dancing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019509_0019685 bit weird
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019685_0019789 stuff
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0020464_0020661 Or just, you know, or just the button.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0021828_0022161 Well no, you still have the menu pop up there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022303_0022415 Well, oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022415_0022683 It's more obvious, isn't it? It's more of a proof, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022781_0022916 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022916_0023124 Υπήρχε μια αλήθεια.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0023440_0023676 I don't know, where's the menu?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0024560_0025014 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0025014_0026007 Ond efallai, gallwn i'n ei wneud yn y menyw, gallwn i gael ymddygiad sy'n mynd yn ystod y pwynt o'r bwynt o'r ddau y mae'r gweithredu hwn wedi bod yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026135_0026438 Felly roeddwn i'n gweithio ar y gweithwyr hynny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026438_0026635 Is that gonna be useful or too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0027270_0027918 Ie, felly pan fyddech chi'n ddod yn ymwneud ar hynny, un pwysau oedd yw, roi i mi gyrraedd, gyrraeddwyr ymwneud â'r ddarlith.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0028408_0028527 Or is that too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0029777_0029908 Yeah, it's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030101_0030163 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030163_0030404 It would be nice to have it interconnected.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031661_0031855 What do you mean by the speaker characterisation?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031855_0031976 Oh well. Yeah, I mean.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032138_0032239 아주 넓어
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032239_0032507 I mean, the speaker characterisation is a bit like you said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032507_0032731 It's like a nice thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032731_0033237 We don't know, we're not actually sure what the user wants for it but it's interesting so why not give it to him?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033408_0033513 I think we should do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033513_0033555 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035475_0035713 Yeah, I mean that's still another level further.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035713_0035849 I mean, we're not even there yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035849_0036132 No, no, no. It doesn't even pop up the speaker characterisation yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036132_0036419 Mae angen i'n defnyddio beth sy'n cymryd pan fyddwch chi'n cymryd ar unrhyw ddau.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036933_0037201 So should we try to do a right plug-in unit?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0038786_0039120 Yeah, there's a second thing about the topics, the topic window.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039120_0039859 You want to somehow be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039955_0040278 Felly gallwn ni'n gwneud hynny yn y ffordd ysbrydol.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040278_0040500 So this stuff is for...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040963_0041128 So yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0041128_0042077 Felly mae gennym ddwy gwasanaethau o ddysgu'r cyfansoddiadau yw eich bod yn gweithio a'u cymryd o bwydau unigol.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0042077_0042413 and then we have the interlinking by right click basically.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0043540_0043601 Double click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0046279_0046699 Bence bu kadar açık bir şey yok
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0048635_0049016 But then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0049016_0049385 and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is, you know what I mean?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050231_0050320 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050661_0051319 It's not the end of the world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051319_0051763 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051763_0052198 I'll check what it does on double click at the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052198_0052354 because I think it will do something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052354_0053059 I don't see anything obvious.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0053232_0053373 I mean, if you can think of something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0054942_0055367 um yeah another thing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055367_0055554 Single audio files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055554_0055657 Do we want to use them or not?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056175_0056388 Yeah, single channel files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056388_0056482 Do we want them?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056482_0056539 I mean.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056935_0057083 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0057083_0057836 I mean we might use them to work with them but do we want to integrate them so that when you browse you can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058138_0058175 Do you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058175_0058529 No, no. It's not going to make much sense if you listen to it on its own, do you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058529_0058566 Less.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0059290_0059432 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061004_0061410 Beth yw'r bobl yn credu yn y ddiddordeb am y clwydrwng y ddiddordeb y ddod eich bod yn ei adnabod?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061410_0061622 Do you think?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061802_0062025 We need to have that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0062025_0062566 I mean I'm very much, I want to have everything customisable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063100_0063186 Probably not, no.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063271_0063546 or whatever they're looking at like dialog decks, whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063546_0063967 But yeah, it depends. I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063967_0064139 And the summary, for example, is typical.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064139_0064653 you open the window, you read through it, you might close it again straight away.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064653_0064783 I think this
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0066465_0066707 I was just gonna say that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067015_0067093 لذلك
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067093_0067298 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067298_0067356 That's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067356_0067509 I'm not sure, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067774_0067816 이 시각 세계였습니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067816_0068028 I don't think that's really... maybe, you probably can.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068028_0068145 I'm sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068145_0068259 I'm sure you can do anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069193_0069280 I can have a look.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069694_0069876 Ond efallai y byddai'n mynd i'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074042_0074793 I don't think people get used to it. When you use windows, you have a lot of windows open.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074793_0074870 to manage them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075637_0075770 Yeah, you can minimize it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075770_0075825 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0076972_0077180 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077312_0077525 Yeah, they're definitely going to be in the same one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077961_0078225 Ie, dyna'r plan ar gyfer y disfreniadau.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078225_0078273 So.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078405_0078674 Yeah, do you want to do that with some reason?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078674_0078914 put the summaries in the same way now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0079024_0079145 Mewn i'n gwneud ychydig o'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0080411_0080636 Yeah? Yeah. You want to do that? That kind of makes sense. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0081658_0082025 And finally, the prototype piece of pokeball.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082025_0082238 What kind of prototype could be produced?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082427_0082876 Because I'm just, you know, I go into the lab and I say, what am I going to change today?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082876_0082966 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082966_0083521 And it kind of just, it just develops. I'm not aiming for anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0083521_0083648 Do we want to aim for something?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084151_0084417 I'm pretty much getting there anyway, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084417_0084676 It's not going to be a lot more.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0086512_0086575 嗯
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0087635_0087724 Mae'n rhesg.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090041_0090334 Like if we're gonna just try and take a look or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090334_0090526 I don't know if you can access other people's...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091245_0091452 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091452_0091735 I don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can show it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092632_0092884 Right, well I'll make that readable then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092884_0093251 So the directory is my number.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093469_0093781 Well this is not difficult. What's your number?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093781_0093953 In all the emails.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093953_0094325 Your number. Your number.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095493_0095832 And then there's a folder in LSSD.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095954_0096182 and it's called the end browser.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0096372_0096633 Yes, and for meetings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097137_0097408 No, I'm extremely organized.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097408_0097519 I've got balls over here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097519_0097586 colorful.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098653_0098772 Yep, so that's me done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098772_0098929 Someone else want to talk about their stuff?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101141_0101294 What were you doing again?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101518_0101603 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103010_0103097 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103097_0103239 You found some code for it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103796_0103892 from a tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0104071_0104139 Come on, cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105314_0105391 Yeah, that's how they...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105647_0105801 So you think you shouldn't be too difficult?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107796_0107929 Oh, sí.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107984_0108254 You have to convert it to some sort of format.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0110673_0111508 I mean you should have a look at the browser code then because they already extract for example transcripts.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0111508_0111638 I'm sure they do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117526_0117565 I mean
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117565_0117771 This week's only two days old.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119772_0119940 That's complete.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119940_0120083 It wasn't what it was.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0120083_0120184 She's so cute.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122509_0122961 The browsers I use it now or as...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122961_0124017 It was there when I took it. It uses the NXT search to get the data out of the files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124017_0124283 Mae'n anodd, ond dwi'n bwysig beth mae'n gweithio.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124283_0124371 I don't quite understand.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124736_0125544 I fynd y data, fel ymhlithio, i fynd y data cyfrannu, mae angen i chi ddysgu i ddysgu idio neu rhywbeth.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0126372_0126907 So they don't say look in that and that folder, but they say search everything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127599_0127915 It does load up quite quickly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127915_0128090 That's not too bad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128090_0128300 But, you know, what have I said like?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128916_0129092 No, this is not the actual search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129092_0129792 This is just when you open, you know, to load the transcript for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129792_0130668 it does an NXT search for the string, I don't know, transcript or text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0131325_0132073 Iawn, felly dwi'n gwybod eich bod wedi gweld y llyfr gweithredu, ond mae'n ddaol a ddex.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132517_0132635 And then, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132635_0133008 because every year all of these
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133146_0133367 Mae'r ffiliau hynny'n cael iddyn nhw.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133367_0133778 and all the transcript files got the string. I don't know what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133778_0134161 words or text or something in it. So just search for those files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0135749_0136115 Um, is it? Um, well, it's in the code.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136115_0136646 just that you define a search object and then you search that string.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136646_0136971 I had to figure out how to do the same thing for the summer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136971_0137045 That's the only way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137199_0137656 I had to understand how they did the transcript to do the song myself.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137932_0138302 Yeah, just search for specific strings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0138539_0139209 So you could just, you know, you could use that when you, if you want to take the data out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0139668_0140326 If you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140326_0140557 you know, whatever you want to do, then just send me an email.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140684_0140767 I can explain it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141071_0141221 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141221_0141861 Actually in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the browsers that I used from this...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141861_0142167 that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142167_0142569 Ac roeddwn i wedi'i ddod o'r gwaith y gallwn ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142569_0142648 I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142891_0143171 So they're all in there yet, still.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143171_0143597 a lot of rubbish but it will be chucked down by the end I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143975_0144143 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145448_0145854 The answer to that is to make a vlog in the short with me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145854_0146061 The weekend is still four days off.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0146751_0146953 I don't actually have that much to do at the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0147125_0147573 to explore any other...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148033_0148494 I can't remember what I'm supposed to do by the way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148494_0148752 Am I supposed to do the summarization thing you both?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0149932_0150211 You do it. Oh really?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150211_0150300 Well, I'll do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150440_0150541 I'm trying to do nothing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150541_0150591 다음
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150701_0150793 If you want to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151237_0151324 Eşim bitirir.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151324_0151360 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152113_0152802 I'm doing communications, which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152802_0153029 That's in two weeks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153288_0153740 Yeah, it's a... How would like, digital? Nine, nine calls, or ten, or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153901_0154781 And then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well, and that seemed like Friday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155035_0155705 I'm not doing any backhanding, so...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155705_0155763 Please.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159233_0159403 Yeah, if you like.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159403_0159664 We can always decide then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159741_0159994 So what are you planning to do over the weekend then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160140_0160327 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160327_0160522 I'm gonna come in the set.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0163891_0164297 It's just that I think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164485_0164537 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164782_0164907 Ychydig o bryd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0166146_0166411 Or you decide I don't really want to go to college.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0167893_0168151 Well, how about we get it done by then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168151_0168188 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168444_0168972 then we can write about it in the interim report. Now we've got something to show.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0170421_0170824 Oh and the search interface.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171085_0171814 maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171814_0172395 And then if you want, you can give that to me and I'll build you a nice few dick boxes and drop down menus.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173031_0173365 Oh that's... that doesn't exist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173365_0173753 That was completely cut and pasted.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173753_0173939 That does not exist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173939_0174331 ما زلت دن من ايه؟
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0174331_0175377 It's actually all these things are nicked from, you know, all these drop-down menus and tick boxes are nicked from Google.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175377_0175487 Screenshot Google.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175679_0176358 Maybe we should make it exist then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176358_0176565 It's gonna be a little difficult, more difficult.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176565_0177317 Ie, rwy'n mynd i'n mynd i, ond y gwaith ymlaen, y pethau a'r bwydau diogelwch a'r blynyddoedd, yr hyn rydym yn gweithio ar ei gael ei ddod yn dda.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177317_0177653 we never agreed on what we were able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177980_0178441 Mae'n bwysig i ni gydag ymlaen a'r fforddau o ddysgu a allwn ni'n gallu ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0178441_0178929 a gallwn ni gyrraedd y cyfle hwnnw, beth ychwanegwyd y gallwn ni eisiau'n ei gyfrifio?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0179135_0179603 Mae'n rhaid i ni ddysgu'r llyfr cyfrifiadau ychydig i weld beth y gallai hynny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0181211_0181306 No, already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183053_0183130 Yes, you can.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183247_0183443 Jumpro bits.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0184062_0184390 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0184390_0184885 I'm doing it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0185631_0185865 Yeah, it's not going to take an hour. Yeah, not exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0185987_0186047 Something like that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186274_0186440 pick your time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186440_0186706 Monday

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0187030_0187079 What did she say?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188099_0188231 Three book.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188231_0188316 Actually, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188886_0189228 Unless you want to do it after. Yeah, that's an option.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0189327_0189368 after
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0190375_0190467 necessarily.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0191393_0191513 We can get in with 3D.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0191862_0191980 Nid yw'n ffann hynny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0195773_0195858 Well, I just...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196080_0196423 I've got it on my computer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196423_0196524 Well, the comments I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196807_0196960 I just think it's better to do afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196960_0197135 then we have all the time we need.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0197135_0197413 Yeah, after the afternoon.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198623_0198860 Actually, it's not even confirmed yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198860_0199278 What? She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199278_0199452 Maybe it doesn't happen at all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199758_0199815 Does it really?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200409_0200538 I don't think we have a reading week, though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200538_0200603 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0201280_0201698 I don't think there was an official one last semester.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0201698_0201870 I think it was just a back hold, wasn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0204855_0204937 That's me Monday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0211713_0211898 So you need to be okay boss, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0213148_0213262 Should we turn these up?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0000037_0000174 I wonder how much of the music
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0000540_0000872 Nee, nee, nee, stop.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0001498_0001562 What is your favorite?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0001907_0002369 Has anybody done anything? No one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0002779_0002990 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0004152_0004342 Give it this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0010638_0010662 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0013878_0014055 Mae'n dda.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0016945_0017081 Yeah, we can't get lost for a second.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0017692_0017968 What else can we have in there?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0018302_0018699 otherwise we're just gonna right click on it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019008_0019065 is in doing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019231_0019324 Maybe, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019324_0019405 Yeah, that's what nobody does.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019405_0019811 Mae'n bwysig i ni ddod o'r blynyddoedd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022078_0022149 Can you swap up that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022508_0022651 It's more of an idiot proof, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022651_0023204 Mae'n bwysig iawn.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0023462_0023539 I don't know where's he going.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0023928_0024337 Well, I guess in meeting browser 1.1.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0024337_0025195 Mae'n dda iawn i'w gweithio.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0026762_0026807 I guess so.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0026807_0027289 Felly rhai o'r bwyd sy'n dod yw, roedd y cyfle i mi gael y cyfle i mi?

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028670_0028789 I mean
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028789_0028885 It's more like...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0033274_0033321 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0035954_0035986 So
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0036443_0036813 Mae'n rhaid i ni ddweud ymlaen am y cyfle.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0036813_0037031 So shall we try it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0037598_0037628 Well,
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0037812_0037941 Even if it is one thing from me.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087314_0087615 seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just paint.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087802_0087921 and try to talk with the GUI.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0088642_0088721 Yeah.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112504_0113049 I'm sure I'm making a mega bit of it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114572_0114667 Yeah, yeah.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0116729_0116852 Next week, I'll do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0116852_0117355 I actually haven't done anything this week because this week's been manic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0117355_0118027 Yes, exactly. I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whatever it was last week.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118966_0119388 And then we had to do an IRP, whatever it was last week as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0119388_0119603 Mae'n unig o bais oedd yn ddifrif i'r pêl.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0124483_0124642 So, we're in. We're in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125645_0125768 That's pretty bizarre, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125768_0125866 I guess it's like, what is...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125951 I've got this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0126161_0126273 Dyna'n bwysig.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0127051_0127129 Nice practice.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0130698_0131380 for and it like it just has an open variable transcript yes whatever find everything that's got that and then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0132084_0132683 Yeah, yeah, because that's the guy who declares a very modest name. And then, yeah, because
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137198_0137323 I see.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137664_0137928 Felly, a oes gennych gweithio'r ddod yn y ffordd y mae'n gweithio'r ddod?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0139133_0139328 I was just thinking that, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0140885_0141114 Have you annotated your code? Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0141114_0141347 Actually in the moment it's got a
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142482_0142647 Just in case.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142647_0142936 Isn't this critical? Yes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0143627_0144045 commenting out one bit at a time.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0146991_0148409 Well, should you plan to explore any other? How's your quantifier raising?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0150042_0150192 You saw it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0151690_0152141 So what courses should I have picked that I'm not doing anywhere else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0153784_0153900 I suppose so, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0156158_0156528 I'll be happy when this week is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0167535_0167757 So it's like two weeks.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0174055_0174256 That's quite pessimistic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0175667_0176204 Maybe we should make it exist then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0177660_0177739 Да, если нужно язык.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0182306_0182820 Can take this for a tutorial. Yeah, you know, the class paths, all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0183594_0183865 That's cool.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197101_0197132 All right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197316_0197367 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0198132_0198470 Hopefully it's not that manzo, it won't matter.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202080_0202399 Some classes didn't, some classes didn't.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202399_0202522 It was already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202522_0202670 They didn't really know what was going on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0203437_0203591 Like what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0206074_0206171 We trust you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209644_0209866 Yeah, I think your comments are basically the same as what you said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209866_0209900 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212177_0212273 What is it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212600_0212704 sunny often.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212704_0212767 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0000096_0000665 I wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002147_0002311 Number one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002707_0002820 Sounds like you've done something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0019845_0020242 to just have the same sort of idiom throughout.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023050_0023188 But then it's not as expensive.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023188_0023463 Like if you want to add more things in the future.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023463_0023492 family.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023492_0023804 Where's the menu? I think it's more flexible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023804_0024042 Mae'n dda.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024287_0024381 You can have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024381_0024516 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024516_0024746 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030336_0030633 Yeah, like maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030633_0030899 I mean, speaker characterization, I didn't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030899_0031139 Just some way to sort of leverage that information.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031139_0031547 like we have it, we're doing it, but how does it help the browsing?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031547_0031789 or what can it give us?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0036844_0036914 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037629_0037844 Is that just from me?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037844_0038530 Is that from any particular window? Like if we want to sort of get, like if we're on the users versus like a topic or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0038530_0038786 have a right click for these various things.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0039767_0039903 Right. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040228_0040305 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040426_0040582 and consistent throughout.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040582_0040671 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042611_0042816 Actually, yeah, another common thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042816_0043260 like we have it sort of set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043260_0043622 I mean, that's kind of a typical kind of action.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043622_0044106 If you double click on a particular topic or something that goes to sort of like a default view.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044106_0044434 So it will be like all the keys of that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044434_0044882 either whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044882_0045291 and just show up the particular instances of that topic in the meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045291_0045449 Like, I'm just thinking to have the default there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045449_0045889 so if somebody knows exactly what they want to do, and we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045889_0046271 So the door click won't do that and save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0046605_0046933 Well, it might come to us.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047144_0047355 Like we have the right click menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047355_0047814 Yeah, right click, but instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047814_0048253 Felly bydd yna ddechrau'r pethau'n dda.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050686_0050787 Still coming.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050787_0050871 How do they close it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050901_0051245 It's not the end of the world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0056935_0057122 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0061525_0062063 I think we probably need that though to have the full flexibility we need to have.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0062635_0063079 The thing is typically though is someone is going to have five windows open at the same time, probably not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0063079_0063650 Probably just two or three of whatever they're looking at like dialog eggs. But yeah, it depends.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0064658_0064727 It'd be good to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066363_0066473 It's like having time there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066473_0066660 I was just having a good time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0067707_0067992 I don't think you have a reason to be that pretty.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0070776_0071251 Yeah, we're even just have buttons on it, toggle buttons or something on the toolbar for that window.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071444_0071496 It's okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071604_0071899 There's a lot of different ways we can do it. It doesn't have to be a tab or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071899_0072058 No, no, it could be like...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072507_0072576 or check marks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072576_0072925 to even have two windows.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0073677_0073785 It's always tough in the way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0075628_0075840 Yeah, you can minimize it. Can you do that? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076219_0076581 Like a lot of these can be, like once we get the disfluences out then we can, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076581_0077006 transcript without the dysphoroncy transcript with a different dysphoroncy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077006_0077098 I'm always, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077098_0077878 how well these sort of using the same window and so we can do a lot of and probably mutually.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077878_0077947 조직.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0080447_0080587 Yeah. You wanna do that? That kinda makes sense.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082308_0082395 into February.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082870_0083007 And it kind of
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0085854_0085988 and put it in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089197_0089641 Actually, is the code accessible, like the GUI stuff that you've done there?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089641_0090010 Can we just copy the latest stuff out of your directory?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090010_0090601 Like if we're gonna just try and take a look or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090732_0091278 Well, if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, then we know the directory to get in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091362_0091506 I don't know if it's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091705_0091985 I think by default they are. No, they're not word readable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0092565_0092653 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093261_0093398 pre-congesting the male.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093398_0093531 Okay, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093531_0093627 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0096404_0096606 for meetings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101290_0101489 Yes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101489_0101940 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102357_0102731 So you could probably just use that code. Like that was behind the question she asked him earlier.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102731_0103149 We're using code and stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0103286_0103406 Yeah, well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104422_0104524 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104524_0104872 I'll probably still have to do some other file management.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104872_0105003 I'm just messing around.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0111840_0111900 That's good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0115078_0115204 Mm-hmm, libraries.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0116848_0117033 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117033_0117172 So you're still.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117172_0117196 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117363_0117533 Yes, exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117533_0118031 I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whatever it was last week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118578_0118835 Well, you're an SPN LP and SP too, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118835_0118904 That's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118904_0118986 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0119724_0119772 Yeah, we will.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120585_0120701 Yeah, that's fun.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120932_0120956 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121271_0121856 Yeah, I was thinking the weekend probably. Yeah. Start attacking this seriously.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121856_0122358 Hopefully I have something by next week that we can sort of try integrating into the GUI.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0122504_0122604 You got to be possible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127378_0127795 Well they did say it wasn't the most efficient.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127795_0128003 It's a load-up quite quickly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0142505_0142623 Okay, look at this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0144017_0144115 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145397_0145576 Yeah, that's interesting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145873_0145886 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146004_0146201 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146304_0146826 Still at the bottom of the mountain. How many hours is this?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0147120_0147459 to explore any other.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0148212_0148293 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149554_0149614 for us to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149880_0150007 You do. Oh really?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150178_0150270 Well, I'll do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150288_0150408 These can be changed.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150408_0150546 So I do not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150546_0150752 I don't know. It doesn't matter.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150752_0150839 if you want to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150839_0151060 Let's just play around with some extra stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0151060_0151220 I have some time. Why not?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153025_0153272 Informatics, of course.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153272_0153425 Yeah, it's a...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153425_0153739 How about like digital? Nine goes around ten or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0156246_0156562 I'll be happy when this week is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157002_0157469 I think that's about it then. Anything else we need to discuss?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157652_0158052 Did we want to meet before we talk to Steve next week?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158298_0158434 Well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158434_0159102 We'll probably get some work done over the weekend, so I know after DNLG or something, maybe just have a little quick little update and just...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159414_0159510 We'll be keeping this up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159510_0159565 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160177_0160605 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160605_0160782 Können wir da mal hin.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160782_0161336 It'll be still a limited version of the next query.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161336_0161524 Bye.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161524_0161669 Won't be the whole thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161669_0161948 Like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162062_0162239 Actually, music is just down on that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162239_0162386 So, this was...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0163096_0163352 summary topics
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0164731_0165115 Yeah, we get behind schedule pretty quick.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165115_0165239 Like you say.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165239_0165581 Well, actually, do we want to set a date for interim prototype?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165701_0165820 yn y cyfle.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0174020_0174401 It's quite messy, actually.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0175200_0175308 I'm gonna do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177666_0177789 Да, если нужно.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177789_0177962 So...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0179495_0179561 to see what that is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181028_0181137 Just like the basic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181137_0181361 No worry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181742_0182107 Just like all the unseen the code and just sort of how, just to see the basics of what you've done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182107_0182452 We just get a quick look over and just can take us through a tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182497_0182770 or the class paths, all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182770_0183332 Just say, okay, well here's, everything's basically set up and then just jump right in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183644_0183749 Thanks, Paul.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183976_0184292 In the morning.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184735_0184862 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184862_0185309 Well, the thing is, yeah, something like that could happen anytime, because, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185309_0185690 Like my schedule is like a class, break, class, break, class.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185690_0185974 I know exactly that's what I'm thinking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185974_0186364 So something like that, and then if I have a class, I can run off. Pick a time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0186612_0186822 Monday might be good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187025_0187110 46?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187237_0187767 Anytime, not at noon or two or four.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187767_0188059 No, in between those, yeah. Like one or three.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189157_0189286 Yeah, that's an option too.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189286_0189383 Mm-hmm.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189596_0189653 So that is good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190197 or 330.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190197_0190345 I just, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190345_0190549 Necessarily. Necessarily.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190727_0190876 Actually, we just had to get in there though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0191260_0191791 Can we get in? We can get in through the car. There's computer rooms in here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192004_0192373 What if we take out? Well if you find me, I'll show you where I'll let us all in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192373_0192682 there and we can look right there. We can look now afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192682_0192781 Ja, ja, ja.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193087_0193279 Just bang on it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193279_0193562 I was just asking Steve about that, whether we can get in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193562_0193757 whether he was gonna get us access into the.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193869_0193922 the computer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194295_0194371 It would do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194872_0194961 Is there a printer in there too?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195394_0195537 Let's go there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195537_0195672 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195774_0196406 We could photocopy your assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0196431_0196575 Well, the comments, I'm thinking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197063_0197125 Nie, lecz...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197125_0197320 Yeah, that's right. After the election.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197879_0198035 as long as DMLG doesn't go late.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199514_0199666 Sounds like me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199840_0199917 Right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199917_0199994 Well, it's supposed to be.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199994_0200131 Very good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200785_0200843 That's a council member.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200979_0201027 pictures.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0201901_0202026 Something like that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202026_0202188 I think one or a couple of classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202392_0202622 It was already, they didn't really know what was going on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202622_0202650 I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202962_0203257 He goes up to the professor, whether he did it or not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203257_0203347 Well, I don't feel like it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203347_0203466 Never.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203466_0203610 I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203610_0204092 I think the IELTS will probably have one to make up for missing classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0204092_0204431 DIL will probably have classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0206079_0206202 I'll wait trust you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0207928_0208146 You want to come and cover?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208436_0208731 and really multiple windows from a single app.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208960_0209241 but most will probably want to go with defaults.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209692_0209717 from
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209873_0210490 Yeah, exactly. Just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210621_0210766 Okay, that's good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210766_0210858 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0002480_0002851 What's the difference?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004285_0004363 오케이.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004581_0004696 So we can do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0006202_0006252 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008166_0008661 Very interesting stuff at the meeting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008661_0008947 I'm gonna rest now.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0023120_0024443 Perfectionist, right? That's a good idea. Let's just cut out the middle man.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024443_0024853 And I'm being like...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024853_0025092 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0025508_0025538 I'll see you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0026675_0027547 I'll look at it when my usual working hours are from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0027547_0029410 I know you're always online. It always makes me feel bad because when I go to bed at like one you're still online. You never go to bed. Just leave your computer on maybe. Yeah, you pretend. Always busy. So maybe...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029410_0029595 but I'm never online in the morning.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029595_0030227 So yeah. Notice that no one is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0030764_0031418 Yeah, do what you want to do with it first and then I'll... That was okay. I've told you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0031418_0031794 Was there anything else we wanted to add?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033101_0033591 Probably want to think about if we want to change goals and stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033591_0034574 I think one thing that we could probably skip totally is removing things from the audio files.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0034821_0035259 I'm not gonna attempt that. No. I don't think so either.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0037281_0037580 Yeah, that's definitely one thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0041751_0041938 My development projects have guru-y
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0042617_0044950 Yeah, yeah. Plus or minus three days. He doesn't have to know exactly. I mean, yeah, I'm not finished, but... So I've only got six days to do the topic segment. You don't have any SPNL PSI on this team.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053678_0053740 Oh.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053740_0054016 Rwy'n dechrau bod yn dda.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0056905_0057415 Should we? I don't know. I think Mike but our things that we have together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057415_0057650 Actually, some of those are part.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057650_0058070 I'm sure you'll like it. I'm very fond of it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058198_0058396 This one is easy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058396_0058593 Well, if we're skipping the audio.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058775_0059373 Just keep it together on the paper.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059565_0059750 На этот случай.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059750_0059870 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0060478_0060694 We could just make it up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064215_0064651 Yeah, my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064651_0065348 I don't know if we've said anything in the afternoon. Maybe I can add a few sentences to what I've done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065842_0065968 This is not funny.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065968_0066281 And also, sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066281_0066343 right down the road.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066765_0066801 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067581_0067962 Well, I still like struggling with Java stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067962_0068274 Yeah, but more comfortable.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068274_0068805 I think I was wondering about that is, I don't look that way so much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068805_0069665 but if you guys know how you could do that, like from the extract words that you did,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0069665_0070203 Like also in extract timestamps and something?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074139_0074374 So now I can just put it in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074504_0074606 from the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074844_0074902 What on the?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0075883_0075962 I'm going to check.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0089209_0089625 No. So it's just when we click.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0090755_0090862 them at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0115911_0115974 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0118646_0118718 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0121631_0121738 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0123724_0123835 Yeah, only pretty.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0125288_0125530 Okay, then that's not... Say something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0126896_0127147 We're not really well...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127290_0127571 We're not gonna do much more than just look at the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127716_0128450 the room like the text will remove the differences because we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna like listen to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128644_0128816 I think we're not doing the audio thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128989_0129377 So I guess just displaying it is right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0129377_0129503 Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't read me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0130870_0130929 gesetzt ist.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131677_0131891 It's probably the best thing to do, as you said.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131891_0132149 I don't think it's going to take long to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0153855_0154032 Well, I mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0169683_0170405 Maybe a snipe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0170405_0170552 So.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0171979_0172091 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172091_0172338 Yeah, okay, actually that's a good idea. I'll take it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172761_0173069 stick it together, she'll shine it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0173660_0174199 Anchoring back any things that I thought was wrong.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174199_0174381 They were changing dialogue.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174381_0174703 I'm back.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175396_0175540 I'm out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175540_0175983 over it to look like 4.96.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175983_0176353 um yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012414 Come on, timeline.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0013926_0014135 You see it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014135_0014222 Okay, thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014265_0014294 Yes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014437_0014850 I'm not sure if we need the outline of the prototype.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014850_0015021 I mean, what were we going to put into that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015441_0015688 Yeah, because that's better.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015688_0015753 the hole.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025379_0025658 Yeah well, I mean it's up to you if you want to keep going with that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025658_0025799 I'm happy to do some as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025799_0025919 I have lots of time tonight.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026045_0026664 A yna, rydw i'n gynnig i chi.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026664_0026730 Oh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027533_0027852 I know you're always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027852_0028436 They always make me feel bad because when I go to bed at like one, you're still online.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028436_0028592 He never goes back.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028865_0029045 Yeah, you pretend.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029045_0029133 Always busy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029133_0029280 You got the right answer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029280_0029409 So maybe...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032386_0032508 Oh, there's more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032508_0032636 That's the sewer, Joel.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032636_0032810 Oh, this is the one that... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0034547_0034909 That's what I thought as well. I mean, are we actually going to attempt that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035060_0035247 I don't think so either.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035247_0035573 I think that's going to be, we don't even know how to approach that at the moment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036630_0036715 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036715_0036928 Yeah, yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036928_0037935 So maybe, I mean we should definitely, well we could probably not put it under this heading.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0037935_0038266 but put it under changes since the initial specification.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0038266_0038901 and say, you know, we didn't do that. We decided the time is too short.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0039384_0039848 Mae'n fwyaf i ni gysylltu ar y bwyd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0040496_0041100 And I think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041252_0041505 Or some of them are a bit later.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041758_0041920 like you know develop projects
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041920_0042435 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042609_0042719 Yeah, yeah. More or less.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042719_0042856 Yeah, that's pretty good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045213_0045428 And you can say, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045428_0046024 We're still aiming for the development to be completely unmatured.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0047485_0047593 to the head.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048189_0048321 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048321_0048439 I really want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048439_0048678 It's not going to be difficult.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048678_0049161 a phan o'r cyfleoedd yma yw'r ffyrdd meta-data.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049161_0049366 That's going to be the work.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049366_0049523 So it's definitely going to be something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0050130_0050484 Yeah, we might turn out even thoughtfully.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0052660_0052741 Yeah, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053015_0053059 Thank you.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0060677_0060763 So, um...

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0063613_0063708 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0076781_0077134 Felly, oes gennych chi'n gwneud unrhyw enw brosur?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0077134_0077273 Is there something that I should...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078221_0078524 No, since you don't do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078524_0078671 Ond roeddwn i'n meddwl...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079643_0079886 I have to go to the camp.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079886_0080250 weekend was out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0083744_0083850 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084213_0084627 At the moment is there a window that comes up?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084627_0084835 What is that, a second result of pain?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084835_0085080 or is that a, you know, does it want to get larger?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0085080_0085345 Um, I thought what we sort of
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090405_0090683 But then you can't see
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090855_0091354 But you wouldn't want to compare the result, one topic result with one summary result.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091653_0091831 actually all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091831_0092168 Er enghraifft, os ydych chi'n cael ymgyrch ar y cyfle hwn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092292_0092417 So assembly in the top
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092417_0092558 I can't even transcribe this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093213_0093492 I mean, we could order them by meeting, for example.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093846_0093986 Reorder by
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093986_0094497 Yeah, well, I mean, that's the second step. The first question is, do we want to order them?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0094497_0094659 How do we want to order them in the first place?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0095725_0095842 Yeah, maybe we should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098204_0098433 Yeah, why don't you just...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098544_0098638 Colocode those.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098797_0099022 the results to sometimes in a case like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101350_0101436 I don't know about if you...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101561_0101936 If you do it straight from, you get the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101936_0102270 ac yna mae ystafell ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0102270_0102935 rock bottom level thing if you found a segment then color it, print it in red or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103083_0103179 As opposed to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103884_0103924 My name is David and I'm from the University of Michigan.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104204_0104330 trying to do it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104991_0105085 Oh.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105335_0105452 Working with an event
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105878_0106013 Oh, oh I see ya.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106358_0106545 We'll figure something out like that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106955_0107583 yeah I mean at the moment it works it works with highlighting in the transcript window doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0109010_0109145 What do you mean you need to work with him?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0110572_0111480 Mae'r holl ymddygiad y box ymddygiad yma yw'r bach yn unrhyw ddod yn ei wneud o'r noes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111480_0111676 I am not sure when it's going out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111951_0112094 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112214_0112478 I don't know what it's called.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112478_0112878 And that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112878_0113350 Fel y dydw i'n dweud, os ydych chi'n ddod ar rywbeth, efallai, mae'n hollol yn gwybod.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0113350_0113593 So maybe it comes with something closer as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114147_0114464 Nid, rwy'n siwr y byddai'n cael y peth yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114635_0114909 Text? Yeah, that's not a lot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114909_0115049 Yep.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115049_0115317 Non-textiles. Mostly things called non-textiles.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115317_0115547 Yeah, why? Honestly not many, right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115547_0115719 Night object model.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122144_0122353 Why do we want to in XML though?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122353_0122857 Rwy'n credu ein bod ni'n gweithio'n ddweud y XML y gallwn ni.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123113_0123303 So as opposed to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123577_0123610 Yes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123720_0124313 Iawn, unrhyw ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o d
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124313_0124485 Yn y cyfle hwn, mae'n ei ffwrdd yn ymwneud â'r un o'r hyn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124485_0124910 Rydyn ni'n mynd i'r flwb yn ymlaen, a'r hyn sy'n mynd i'r ddwyloedd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124910_0125118 Nid yw'n stori at all.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0125724_0125789 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129048_0129102 So I guess.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129404_0129617 Ie, ie, dwi'n mynd i'n mynd i'r bach yn ymwneud â hynny.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129617_0129694 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0131930_0132233 I don't think it's going to take long to produce anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0132233_0133122 Mae'r cyfle hwn yn dda. Mae'r cyfle hwn yn dda. Mae'r cyfle hwn yn dda. Mae'r cyfle hwn yn dda. Mae'r cyfle hwn yn dda. Mae'r cyfle hwn yn dda.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0134416_0135016 Gallwch i ni gwneud hynny yn ymddygiad gyda'r ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymwneud â'r ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgy
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135186_0135590 So if certain, you know, if it's a proper word,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135590_0136024 print it on both, both panes and if it's not proper wear then print only on one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136024_0136232 Ond roedd yna ffantais.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136493_0136570 Yay, barbecue.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137075_0137136 So then.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137251_0138184 you know, the good way of doing it not together is that if someone doesn't want to look at the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138184_0138407 you know, the chop file and you don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138548_0138826 But I mean you can, you know,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138826_0139583 you can write something like we'll try and do it on the fly and observe if that's going to take too long.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0139583_0140140 os byddai'n mynd i'w ddod yn dda, fyddai am ymwneud â'i ddod i ffil.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0140299_0140382 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0141684_0141738 Alright.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0151881_0152103 That's what programming is all about, I'm afraid.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153323_0153432 It's the higher people.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153895_0153967 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154087_0154810 Yeah, why don't you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154810_0154970 if you want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154970_0155409 I personally don't want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0155409_0155526 ac roeddwn i'n mynd i'w gwneud yn ymddygiad.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0158643_0158795 Well it has already loaded anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0160386_0160730 Felly, a oeswn i gyd yn gweithio'r lletra o 2 o'r gwaith ymlaen?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0160914_0160996 I'm clear to the future.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161180_0161213 네.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161522_0161681 Yeah, well maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161799_0161936 I think you can split that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0162278_0162642 Lose a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164106_0164193 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164255_0164357 No, maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164930_0165079 Continue to.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168333_0168547 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168547_0168840 Anything else anyone wants to talk about?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168840_0169092 Well, I'll sleep away.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0169365_0169426 Bye, ciao.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0169934_0170046 Maybe a sneak.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0170046_0171229 So we're all still writing our summaries, sending them to you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0171534_0171616 How kind.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0173065_0173652 and then send it on to us so that we can nod.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0174996_0175109 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0175109_0175452 I haven't used my pen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0176567_0176635 Of course.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0013743_0013850 Oké, ja.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0013850_0013946 Bless you guys.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0016742_0017526 Yeah, we can find something. This could be just some, just describe some screenshots.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018361_0018535 Yeah, Kenny Hanks. We can just ignore that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018535_0018610 Oh yes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019159_0019391 You can hear that, yeah, it's a screenshot and stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019391_0020010 Mae'n bwysig bod y cyfle wedi'i gael ffynhau o'r hyn, neu bod yn un sefydliad yn un.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020010_0020078 감사합니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020992_0021379 I've written the topic segmentation.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022275_0022355 the song.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022355_0022375 It's
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022984_0023725 I think the penne that I should do. Perfectionist, right? Yes. That's a good idea.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023859_0023970 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023970_0024180 I'm not even gonna tell you to get a girl anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0024180_0024754 And I'm being like...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0026408_0026889 Mae'n gallu gwneud y ffaith yn ogystal â hynny.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0028261_0028966 He never got that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0031135_0031257 I'm not telling you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0035738_0036107 Mae'n bwysig i ddweud y gallwn ni'n ei wneud os oes gennym mwy o amser.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036107_0036226 Good for you to work, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036226_0036472 Mae'n rhaid i'n gwneud ymgyrch.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036472_0036842 Should have we had more time. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0037097_0037360 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038504_0038624 We decided that
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038837_0039136 We felt there were more important things to do at our time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0039295_0039468 than wearing them.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041533_0041627 Yeah, that's good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041627_0041784 That's a section.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042375_0042600 Best Foul on Target. Ach so.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042801_0043608 Plus or minus three days. He doesn't have to know exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0044105_0044380 Felly dwi'n cael 6 dydd i wneud y segment ymddygiad.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0045439_0045574 speaking
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046016_0046324 Speaking of characterisation, it's supposed to be done already. Oh really?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046324_0046575 Yeah, two days ago.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047298_0047592 Give me a week and I'll tell you the answer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047900_0048145 Maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0048322_0048580 I really want to do it. We won't disappear now.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049534_0049781 Yeah, we might make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049921_0050095 But we might not, you never know in my time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050095_0050312 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050861_0051348 The topic segmentation with LCSEG and textiles is basically done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051348_0051744 It just needs to be... Tuned? Yeah, tuned, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051744_0052069 Search the parameters, but it's made in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0052069_0052298 and see what happens.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0055240_0055341 Thank you very much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0065809_0065877 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0066825_0067239 Beth am y datblygiad ymlaen?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067239_0067390 Dyma beth sy'n ffawr.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067390_0067474 That's not coming at all.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0068144_0068204 Mm-hmm.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070071_0070141 Easy, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070141_0071209 When it pulls up the segments, part of that, one of the attributes, if you do get attributes, call them with the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071209_0071456 Mae'n mynd i allan o atribydd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071456_0071927 That will tell you what attributes it's got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071927_0072435 a gallwch ei wneud yn ymddygiad, neu gallwch chi ddod yn ffordd a dweud, dwi'n mynd i'r amserau.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0072435_0073145 Felly, dweudwch, ymwneud â'r atif atif, a'i dweud, mae'n cael atif atif, ac mae'n cael atif am ymwneud â'r atif.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073145_0073437 Okay. And that will tell you the start times and end times. Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073437_0073534 I think it would size it double.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074447_0074908 Mae'n ymwneud â'r elementau non-leol.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074908_0075230 Mae'r adeg yn unrhyw ffordd ddwyll.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0075640_0075774 I should turn that away.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088240_0088442 What have... You confused me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088442_0088847 Do you have three separate windows with three separate different types of windows?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089021_0089334 Oherwydd, nid yn ddiforol.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089480_0089529 So it's
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0090204_0090299 or 10 hours and 20 minutes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0091839_0091961 Yeah, she's a great person.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0113936_0114207 It's got a night text playing or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114207_0114225 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114691_0114955 Text? Yeah, isn't that right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115139_0115208 Take two.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115208_0115321 Bence normal
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115533_0115991 Knight object model.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115991_0116432 Knight Object Model
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0117869_0117982 with the um
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118130_0118569 Mae'n gweithio'r disblwnsiau. A oes gennych chi'n gwneud rhywbeth amdano?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118766_0119675 because I was wondering how we're going to write it back to HTML, I mean, XML, if we did the processing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0119829_0119979 Writing it back, talking some more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120575_0120691 It's a blooper text.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120820_0120872 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121398_0121828 Mae'n bwysig iawn i chi ei wneud, os yw'n 9 o'r ffm.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121828_0122215 There is some bizarre method that puts things back into X and Y forms.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0123311_0123783 O, ddechrau beth sydd angen, ddechrau bwyntiau o'r XML, ond ddechrau cerddau ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124458_0124617 Rydyn ni'n mynd i'r flwb yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124617_0124713 Mae'n dda.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124713_0124801 That's it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124801_0124917 Like that. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125458_0125580 Say something different there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125580_0125640 Danke.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125789_0125942 Rwy'n gwybod hynny'n dda.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125942_0126120 This makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126120_0126533 Mae'n mynd i fod yn gallu gwneud pethau ar y ddwylo.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126533_0126623 So yeah, that's fun.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129316_0129464 This one is tough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129659_0129757 I think it's like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130301_0130473 would just be a blur of a summary.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130473_0130975 it won't look like, it won't say speaker X says this, speaker Y says that, speaker Z says this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131287_0131598 They will look ugly probably because it will look just black and white.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131598_0131725 Unless you want to start.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0132163_0132382 Mae'n dda iawn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133236_0133358 It doesn't look funny.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133510_0133859 So then it just goes through and says that this word equals that imprint.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0134183_0134337 Mae'n llawer o'r bwnt o'r bwnt hwn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136501_0136598 Yeah, you gotta be kidding.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136598_0136789 That's probably not as difficult.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136789_0136955 You just think, fatten the code out a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136955_0137127 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0138300_0138507 You don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140016_0140051 Should I?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140051_0140536 They're just be-if statements, aren't they?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140536_0140696 I was just thinking of the lines in this...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0141246_0141295 That's it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0143934_0144261 Although on the fly it's typically pretty.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144261_0144569 even trying to read it in XML, which I've always complicated enough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144569_0145137 Roeddwn i'n cael ei gael i mewn i'r bach. Roeddwn i'n cael ei gobeithio yn ôl i'r bach, oherwydd roedd hi'n bach iawn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145283_0145518 Felly gallwn ni'n ei wneud gyda'r blynyddoedd noed, yn y pethau.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145518_0145969 Mae'n dda iawn i'w ddiddordeb, ond roedd hynny'n ddiddordeb iawn.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146180_0146289 I can't believe it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146289_0147004 You have to start defining object models like the knight thing in the game. All these are weird things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0147004_0147093 So, see you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0157867_0157939 I spent it really.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0158908_0159085 Ie, mae'n dda. Mae'n dda i'w ddod.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159237_0159400 It's just a four loop, really.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159400_0159494 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0160891_0161131 Rwy'n meddwl bod yna gweithio'n ffyrdd yn y sefydliadau fy hun.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0161282_0162274 Roeddwn i wedi ddweud, beth wedi gwneud ymlaen, a beth am wneud. Ac rhai o bryd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162274_0162383 I think the least thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162560_0162760 Mae'n mynd i'r beth o bwynt o bwynt o bwynt o bwynt.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162760_0162852 Eu sou o S.N.K.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162852_0163194 Sometimes it's easier to have the top in the same instructions.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163194_0163417 So you took about three characters and you see where you're coming from.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163985_0164101 Goals or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164101_0164355 Bullet points.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164381_0164747 Because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there... Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164747_0165061 Mae'r bwysau yn ymwneud â'r bwysau.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0165202_0165243 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0168522_0168675 So, I'm seeing us.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172742_0172828 Used to get together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172828_0172899 She'll show in it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0176443_0176700 Oh mein Gott.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178273_0178394 I hope that is alright here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178394_0178659 That was a bit out of here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003903_0003990 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003990_0004240 I think it's this one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004240_0004381 I'n mynd i'r system.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004495_0004612 Cheers.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004745_0005954 I think that was the first thing I just sort of did, a really sort of brief version of what we have to do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0005954_0006231 Mm-hmm.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012470_0012730 Actually, without I was just copying them straight out of the other documents.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012730_0013102 So it's all, whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0013772_0013822 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014111_0014174 Oh, shit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014174_0014244 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015004_0015184 Well, just sort of. Well, the thing is, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015184_0015707 we're going to be touching on all that during the other part.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015707_0015897 Oh. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015897_0016426 Well, it's just something that he had mentioned in the previous, like just to sort of have a prototype together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016426_0016728 And I was just saying that we could potentially do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016728_0016792 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016792_0016898 I think he's on something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017730_0017785 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017785_0018043 Like the thing is I was thinking even in the stuff that I was doing, I mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018043_0018395 just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018395_0018519 Can either of us, or we can just ignore that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018519_0018560 So
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018560_0018829 Oh yes, actually I had that at the very end, screenshot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018829_0018936 Put that in Chop on the screen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018936_0019111 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020934 Anyways, so yeah, this is just very general structure. I guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs in. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021133_0021163 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021313_0021454 I'm not.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021454_0021977 So I know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this I could do that before I'm able to, you guys.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021977_0022293 Otherwise, no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0022293_0022953 Does someone else want to throw it together? Actually, I can probably still throw it together if you want. Put your parts into this one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023125_0023329 Perfectionist right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023630_0023745 That's a good idea.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023745_0024214 I guess we just cut out the middle man.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0024214_0024440 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0027526_0027739 I know you're always online
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028668_0028943 Just leave your computer on maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028943_0029179 He pretend, always busy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0029731_0030110 Notice that no one is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030110_0030238 And...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030488_0030619 So I'll send it out to you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030619_0030654 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031329_0031464 ありがとうございます
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031677_0031881 Was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031881_0032249 I mean, essentially was what you can see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032249_0032460 Oh, there's more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032460_0032772 Well, that's the sewer jollab. Oh, this is the one that...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032772_0033027 Yeah, yeah, it was just copied straight out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0036788_0037258 Unless we discover some sort of time warp thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0038142_0038232 of specification.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041160_0041286 This, this, and this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041286_0041566 or some of them are a bit later.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041566_0041631 Merci Yvan.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042654_0042791 more or less.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042881_0042968 through.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042968_0043351 Plus or minus three days.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043351_0043505 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043505_0043786 That was true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044331_0044624 いや、いいや、すっごい
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044624_0045064 You don't have any SPL PSI mistakes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046238_0046442 Not really. Yeah, two days ago.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046442_0046502 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046502_0047118 For one of those, something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0047576_0047898 Like, should we put a hint that something like that might happen into the document?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0048484_0048561 It's not.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049218_0049277 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049277_0049343 That's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049542_0049639 Okay, that make it disappear.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0051551_0051685 tuned
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0054984_0055312 I could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055312_0055519 That's essentially the same as it was.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055519_0055766 More detail specifically.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057504_0057594 What does it part?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057638_0057891 I think so, yeah, I'm very fond of it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057891_0058016 Yeah, but what about
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0058470_0058757 What if we're skipping the audio one and then it's not easier?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059159_0059383 Have you taken any more from the camp?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059383_0059545 Have you taken any more of a look at it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059545_0059671 Other disciplines, okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059852_0059926 You could probably...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060166_0060504 I don't have time to look at that before tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060504_0060724 We could just make it up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060724_0061147 Like I'll claim one, you claim the other for the search things and then we can leave that one as a joint one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061295_0061394 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061780_0062365 Um, I found finally today something that I can build it in and I should have something for tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0062365_0063158 I should at least, very least have a GUI and a wire. I'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063158_0063436 I want to get something. I want to see this. I want to get it together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063436_0063952 I have an image in my mind, and I just want to see it on the thing, and then get a nice screenshot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065078_0065557 sentences to what I've done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065557_0065912 I mean, with the intention that this is done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065912_0066273 And also, sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066273_0066537 when you write down the words and the ideas as, oh, okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066537_0066801 I think you wanted to do something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0067941_0067973 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077159_0077621 something that um there is but i haven't made a lot of changes to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077621_0077969 so I might just delete what I've done and copy it in from yours.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077969_0078306 Because I'm sure you've probably made some changes already.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078306_0078362 Uh-huh.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078362_0078473 since Friday.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078539_0078676 I thought you said... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078676_0078817 Alright, I see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078856_0079508 I thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were coming up with pixels on the webcam or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079508_0079598 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0079847 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079969_0080142 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080142_0080966 Yeah, so if you're... Although there's stuff out there that... Actually, I'm gonna try and minimize the amount of changes I make to Ambroser anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080966_0081036 شكراً لك
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081165_0081248 She'll be finishing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081248_0081582 Actually, just to clarify, last week when we were talking about our search results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081582_0082029 Like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082114_0082502 Do we want separate result pains for each of those?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082502_0083092 or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083092_0083471 so that when they click on that, it's gonna go to the relevant thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083471_0083998 Like just if they check all three say topics, summary, how three different windows come up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0084148_0084359 or three like some.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085039_0085733 I think what we sort of discussed last week was tablature on the same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085733_0086046 So we'll be on the search window, bottom half of the search window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086046_0086485 I know we still want to keep it that way, but that's what it was going to be working with.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086485_0086802 So it's just like you click those and just load up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086802_0087255 Yeah, splits that thing into two or three or whatever it is. One, two, three, depending on which one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087255_0087384 ones you check.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087384_0087866 So if we want to do it that way, you know, like it probably doesn't matter too much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087866_0088246 Just trying to think if there's going to be any other issues down the road.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0088813_0089409 No, just pains, just result pains. Okay, not three different... No, no, no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089409_0089503 Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089503_0089859 So it's just when we click, you know, topics and summaries for what we want to search.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089859_0090212 There'll be two result pains.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090212_0090467 I don't know really tabs
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090467_0090932 I like the idea of tabbing. But then you can't see all of them at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0091303_0091783 Well, it's no, but the thing is if you're looking, if you can check them both, you'll see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092178_0092282 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092314_0093320 So the summary and the topic and the transcript. Or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0093620_0094088 Oh yeah, I guess that was the other thing, whether we want to have this reorder by call or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094088_0094233 Well, that's not nice.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094233_0094296 second
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094729_0094978 I think, yeah, probably by meeting makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094978_0095288 I mean, essentially they're in time order.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095288_0095598 So, that kind of makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095767_0095835 You should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096204_0096458 Should be medium. No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096458_0096585 should be for Wednesday.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0098888_0099364 I think sometimes in a case like that, like I've run across some in other languages.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099364_0099946 It's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it's put into a list box or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099946_0100175 It's hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100175_0100452 and then if we're highlighting something in the transcript window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100452_0101260 it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a list box, an item in a list box.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101260_0101496 So, no but if you...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101496_0101599 Where's it coming from?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103036_0103108 As a
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103329_0103842 Um, yeah, it's just like from past experience of there's goofy little things that happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103842_0104599 It just doesn't let you save certain things and it just kind of... trying to do a different kind of... to go to a different window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0104599_0105080 So if you want to go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105080_0105308 At that point, that's where it starts getting a little bit tricky.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105308_0105835 because you're working with an event handler within the one panel or a list box or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105835_0105890 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106024_0106677 There are ways around it, but we'll be able to figure something out before tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106677_0106952 Or delegates or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106952_0107083 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107588_0107656 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107851_0108601 I think he was saying that as long as we implement that interface, it should work with anything that we do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108601_0108763 Like highlighting me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108763_0109120 I think that was a... What do you mean, you need to work with him?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109120_0109343 Um, isn't Jonathan saying something about that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109343_0109760 I think it was just like, as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109760_0110058 we should be able to have that highlighting happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110058_0110116 Mm-hmm.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110116_0110158 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0113476_0113968 Maybe I should use that as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115367_0115504 Why is it not many?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115704_0115871 Oh, okay. That makes sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0119968_0120335 I thought we were just going to have that as words.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0120335_0121016 like not as XML, just sort of as a... What was that though? Text file. Well, transcript.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121016_0121339 No, because then we need all the other data from the transcript.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121635_0121783 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121783_0121815 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125252_0125286 I'm tired.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125286_0125531 Okay, but not, but not smelled. Say something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125531_0125664 Yeah, thanks a lot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125664_0125902 That's really what we were thinking before.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125902_0126033 Actually, but this makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0126624_0126989 Yeah, if we're going to do the XML, then fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129344_0129433 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129704_0130120 But the thing is, how would we display them if we do take these fluencies out and just, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130120_0130471 created text file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130967_0131486 Unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0131568_0131631 That's flippy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140401_0140531 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140531_0141101 I was just thinking about it, it's probably been used like XSLT to kind of just transform it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141101_0141775 flip it into just a transform zone like a style sheet.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141775_0142195 And then it's kind of like there's usually things built in to, well, it should be built into John Lewis.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142195_0142837 and process XML into, like, and just create whatever file it's gonna be in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142837_0143107 It's been a couple years since I've looked at anything like this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143107_0143373 That might even be easier.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143373_0143725 And then that way we could even pre-process that beforehand.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143725_0143963 I don't know, we don't want to have to do that, right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143963_0144215 Although, on the fly, it's typically pretty.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144532_0144657 I gave up too, and then...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144657_0144731 Are you going?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0145444_0145524 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146551_0146596 But
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146596_0146733 in getting your screws.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146895_0146946 It's insane.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147168_0147522 I was thinking I might try and talk to, who was it, Jonathan or Gene?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147522_0147857 Like just to see what they, what system they use to develop this stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147857_0148685 because it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just to actually use the system.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148685_0148921 you know, at a higher level rather than kind of, you know,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148921_0149202 and playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149202_0149408 and be nice and just sort of see what they're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149408_0149827 So I might try and contact them, see if there's...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149964_0150225 and other hints that you give us.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150225_0150542 just to get things moving at a higher level, I guess.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150688_0151137 It seems to be more interesting to use it as a real developer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151304_0151743 It just seems like a little tinkering here and there, just adding a couple things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151889_0151929 That's more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152034_0152305 No, no, it shouldn't be.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152305_0152397 It should be higher level.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152397_0153316 that should be conceptual and coming up with brilliant ideas and then just bringing those to reality.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0153441_0153811 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0155864_0156372 Like the thing that I was thinking there as well is once it's done for one meeting, it's done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156372_0156430 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156430_0156582 text file or XML or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156582_0157089 Yeah, just, I don't know, it doesn't make any difference really either way to me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157089_0157402 It's like, if it's fast enough on the fly, then sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157402_0157749 That's about the only issue I have with on the fly, whether it's fast or not.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157956_0158182 Especially with Java and stuff like that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0158182_0158649 if it's loading the file and processing it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0159496_0159838 with a run to the memory.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161181_0161213 네.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161805_0161922 Mae'n dda i'n gweithio.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0162054_0162383 I can do each.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163146_0163210 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163372_0163537 I think that does make sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163537_0164018 But maybe at the end, maybe just a point form of things that we're still working on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164018_0164192 or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164712_0164801 Yeah.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168112_0168210 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168501_0168596 So,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171165_0171447 Or she'll just take, she can take it from now on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171447_0171516 Das ist meine Idee.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171516_0171724 How kind.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171724_0172114 I can get you if you want to stand up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172114_0172473 Yeah, okay, actually that's a good idea. I'll take one quick look over.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172473_0172728 try and get it as good as I think they'll be.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0173283_0173628 I'm going to have to do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0174290_0174848 They were changing dialogue back.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0175479_0175581 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176364_0176543 Oh, oh my gosh.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176882_0177179 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0005327_0005656 A oes gennym ddweud hynny yn y tôn i chi? Ie.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012507_0012860 I think there is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012860_0014128 And just because the topic box and all this is based on what was it called, non night text area or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014128_0014333 and takes the reigns always.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014333_0014626 Mae'n cael rhai gwybodaethau yna.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014626_0014856 So you should probably look at the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0015536_0015731 I'm not sure if it's inbuilt though to be honest
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0016668_0016786 네.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018250_0018339 You don't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018339_0018522 Felly, os ydych chi'n mynd i'w wneud hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018522_0018869 Yeah, I was thinking about it. I was getting the impression.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0019053_0019099 아, 진짜요?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0021698_0021836 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0022987_0023159 Okay yeah I see what you mean.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023237_0023267 That's what I was.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0024002_0024042 All right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0026456_0026737 I think I should have come back here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0031624_0031695 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0033862_0034307 What the easiest thing to do is tell how you want to display it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034307_0034400 Just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034863_0035710 so what we'll whenever we open a window for one speaker

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036935_0037078 Pretty much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0038146_0038190 What was it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042122_0042347 The one present.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042347_0042747 Although we could do... We could do the one highlighted as being...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0044963_0045399 Mae hynny'n ei wneud yn ymwneud â'r hyn a ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045399_0045889 that you want to see, per topic you want to see which one spoken most, something like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045889_0046420 Felly gallwch chi ddod o'r bwydau hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0046420_0047031 A byddai'n dod â'r cyfle a gallwch chi ddod y peth y byddai'n dda.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047031_0047163 Do you want to do that then?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047936_0048004 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0048166_0048640 Felly, ie, pethau angen fel, roedden nhw'n mynd i'w ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0049178_0049243 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055128_0055476 Can you put in there what topic we're speaking about as well? Yeah, yeah, it'll be...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055476_0055829 roeddwn i'n gallu defnyddio hynny i'r bwynt yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056075_0056113 Without
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056541_0056607 That wasn't well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0057730_0058078 because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0058078_0058747 Mae gennych gweithredu popi'n gweithredu y ddau sy'n rhoi'r lles o'r cyfleoedd yma.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060366_0060622 So how would you calculate that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060622_0061042 A allwch chi'n gwneud y cyfrifoldebau fel y gallwch chi'n populi?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061042_0061259 Mae'r ystyriaethau ymlaen yn ystod hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061553_0062005 O rai, felly mae'r bwyd yn ystod ymlaen. Mae'r clwys ysbytai'n gwybod am y peth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062005_0062172 and the meeting class in Isabella.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062567_0062708 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062708_0063054 So have you done these yet? No, no, I've already done them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063054_0063276 Just gotta decide on what we want to...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063527_0063800 Roeddwn i'n credu bod y pethau eraill yn fwy bwysig, felly roeddwn i'n gwneud hynny ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063948_0064594 Felly mae'n gweithio'n gweithio ar hyn o bryd?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0066667_0066722 Oh, I see.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067308_0067648 Felly roeddwn i'n gwybod pan mae'n rhan o ddefnyddio.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067648_0067710 If you can, if you want to.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068138_0068232 우리 민희 100조
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068232_0068607 Just the injure. Yeah, but it's not going to take very long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068607_0068783 I mean, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070272_0070386 Smells good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070386_0070452 Felly, a yw hynny?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070452_0070695 Mae hynny'n ystod y...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070898_0071135 Ychwanegwch chi'n ymwneud ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0071468_0071520 Actually, I can't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0072563_0073206 Are you wanting to write that indirectly or what do you want to do with that? What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073206_0073320 if you want to change my code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073552_0074028 Do you want to change the original Embraerter file in?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074028_0074121 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074288_0074356 Have you done that now?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074568_0074831 Oh, okay, so not the actual one, but a copy of it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075146_0075269 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075269_0075311 Real
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075690_0075818 Well just tell me when.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075818_0076625 because I usually work on my own copy for the day and then update it without checking if the one in the share has changed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0076625_0076783 Mae'r cyfle hwn yn ymwneud â'r gwaith.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0077208_0077283 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0078579_0078992 Felly yw hynny'n gweithio ar hynny i gynnyddi'r ffordd yn fwy fwy?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0079726_0079893 I mean the highlighting stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0081352_0082292 Actually for any text area, whatever it is, they define some handy highlights on that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082292_0082443 Felly mae gennych chi gydag o brydau gwahanol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082443_0082847 Felly rydych chi'n ei ddod o. Felly roedd yn ymwneud ymlaen amdano.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082847_0083407 We've got user highlights, selection highlights, time highlights.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083564_0083648 Something else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083866_0084550 So you can quite easily, if your text area is called area, you just do area dot set highlights or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084550_0084615 MBC 뉴스 손준영입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084903_0085417 Dyna'r ffordd y byddaf i'n ei wneud i gysylltu, i gysylltu dros ymhellach mewn amser a transgrif.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0085647_0085685 That's good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091133_0091466 ond os ydych chi'n gwybod, mae'n dda.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091466_0092196 oeddwn i'n cael ymddygiadau i'n ei gynnig. Ond roedd yna'n dweud, o no!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092196_0092783 Does it talk to you now? It talks to you. It's a nice machine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092912_0093190 I've spent too much time on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093287_0093764 Alright, well I've been doing some random pop-up windows for the speaker characterisation, which is good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093764_0093949 So fill that in now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093949_0094239 The windows are all there now after lots of filling.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094447_0094830 Wel, yw, ond, pop-up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094830_0095852 because it basically has to set up like 10 pop-up windows in memory as in already initialize them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0095852_0097625 because there might be 10 speakers. Now all have to have different windows. And working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the topics of the meetings that topic was mentioned in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0097625_0098398 And I have a question about the said we wanted to start screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098398_0098686 What kind of starts, Randy, what do you want?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098686_0099910 I mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser or something? Well, it's an SD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0099910_0100194 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0101016_0101819 So do we want, yeah, maybe we could write on like that, whatever it's called, the top of the window saying welcome to the media browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0102824_0103036 Yeah, how?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103036_0103596 Yn y cyfle yma, mae'n dda i'w ddod o'r menyw, fel y byddwch chi'n gweld.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103596_0104380 with all the, and that because it's the dialogue class that you use there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105197_0105814 I mean, I think they should have two options, either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105814_0106146 And through that once you've got the results you click on something that's not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106641_0106681 Does it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106846_0106986 The only thing you can search is in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0109093_0109356 A allwch chi ddod o'r obiect nom?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0110808_0111239 I suppose we wouldn't want to use, yeah, we wouldn't want to use NXT at the beginning anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111239_0111597 because we don't want to search locally.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111597_0111799 So honestly, no.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112036_0112390 Yn ogystal â hynny, roedden nhw'n mynd i'r adeiladau ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112390_0113079 So let's say they have two options, either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0114980_0115106 Maybe why do we want default?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0115106_0115222 I mean, just...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117710_0117866 Yeah, but local search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117866_0118149 We can't do levels though, we're not anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118149_0118201 I'm pretty sure that's better.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118903_0119072 So we're getting any useful
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0119572_0120392 Mae'r gweithredu ffyrdd ymlaen yn dynnu'r gwaith nifodol i'r cydnabod ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0120772_0120979 Well yeah, that's always going to be the case with search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0127554_0128257 I mean you can, you know the option is to do a search in the way that, if you do a global search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128257_0128525 ac yn ystod ystafell, bydd angen i'r cyfle i'r cyfle.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128525_0129236 as in not even meetings, but the name of the meeting. So, you know, say you want to search for the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129236_0129671 then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129671_0130137 and then you can decide, well I want to search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0131846_0131917 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0133484_0134502 There is, yeah, in one of the papers they have names, such as... Oh, do they really translate it? Yeah. Like the work
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0134502_0135159 Even better understanding.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135159_0135296 That's a working group
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135328_0135540 I love that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136130_0136376 So I've put that in already too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136513_0136562 Let's go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136797_0137361 So yeah, again, concretely to the startup, startup, whatever it is, window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0138687_0138799 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139654_0139748 Yeah, how is that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139748_0140090 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddweud y byddwch chi'n cael amser i'r hyn hefyd?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0143830_0144030 It would have been like a list of
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0146883_0147426 So the general score would that be for the whole of the language?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0147621_0147931 Well, you know, it's why I'm asking.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148152_0148272 Like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148571_0149086 So what would the, if we had these fake topics, what would they look like? Bunch of keywords.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149086_0149296 ychwanegol
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149296_0149507 Mae'n dda i'r lles o ddwyfn o bethau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0150892_0151721 Because that would be really handy then, we can actually test it on the user. As opposed to just doing it and not using it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151721_0151946 because if you just have the segmentation, that's great.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151946_0152612 Ond dweudwn ni ddim yn gallu cydweithio'r gweithiau i'r gweithiau anotatio, y gweithiau sy'n segmentio.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154848_0154929 You're not alone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154929_0155000 Mae'n bwysig iawn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0157347_0157497 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158504_0158755 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158755_0158866 just looked at
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158866_0158946 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159488_0159909 Sort of, but then the main idea was more like to speed up, speed the search up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159909_0160355 I guess NXT over the whole of the covers would just not feel...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160355_0160440 That way it's slowed down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160737_0161085 No, but the general inverted file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161085_0161177 It's still uses a bit.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161177_0161402 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161402_0161533 That would just be nice extra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161826_0162209 Yeah, I wasn't sure. I don't think we have that in the document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162322_0162464 You too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162464_0162631 So what? It's only interim.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163367_0163566 Yeah, I mean if you have time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163566_0163798 because I'm only going to do this if I've got time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163798_0164155 oherwydd, rwy'n meddwl, yna byddai'n rhoi, os ydych chi'n gweithio ar ddau gwybodaeth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164155_0164659 it will give you the the meetings but also how often that word occurred in that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164659_0164887 We just give you a ranking with the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164944_0164998 I'm going to go into the bathroom.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0165287_0165337 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166254_0166691 Mae'r tfidf yn unig yw'r scôr ddiforol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166691_0167133 Ie, os ydych chi'n gweithio ar ddyniad a'ch ymwneud yn oed fel…
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0167133_0167654 basically all of the meetings. You want to see where they actually spoke about it, where they're just mentioning it once.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169068_0169150 language and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169607_0169964 Sunny day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171103_0171347 And then add those up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171347_0171413 because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171413_0171547 The things that you can't do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0184287_0185068 So, to come back to the start of spring. Oh, okay. I'm very unsure about what that should look like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185068_0185739 I mean, for the part where you can choose the meeting, what kind of information do you want to have about the meeting?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185739_0186339 I mean the longer name, obviously, if there is one, because they don't all have longer names.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186339_0186624 what the users that spoke.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186624_0186781 uses that took part
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186781_0187146 then that's pretty much the same for the same group
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187463_0187523 a set
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187875_0188443 Yeah, just to give them an idea, a general idea of what there is, so they can pick a...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190217_0190360 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190360_0191168 Rwy'n mynd i weld y cyfle y mae'n ddod yn ystod y cyfle hwnnw o'r grwp o'r gwaith.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191168_0191313 yn y cyfle hwnnw.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191313_0191358 Look at that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193761_0193944 Keep it more general.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193944_0194339 because we just want to have a way of, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0194339_0195069 Because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting, they can browse through that quite nicely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0196708_0196761 What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197378_0197509 How are we going to know that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197755_0197983 It can happen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198418_0198689 But that would defy the whole point of browsing, right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198689_0198979 If you only want to look at the fire... Well, alright, call it favorites then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198979_0199684 Yeah. You can have a favourite. You just scroll down the list and find your favourite one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0199684_0200295 Yeah, it's not enough information. It's not like they come back every day and do the same grousing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0200295_0200898 Айфу ка
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0201511_0201565 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0203619_0203867 So we can sort out the file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0204433_0204785 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205023_0205757 I wasn't going to put any help in there, any sort of explanation of how the browser works to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205757_0205864 Dobrý.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207091_0207139 I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207616_0207937 But I mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208152_0208271 Yeah, we'll switch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208271_0208431 Even if it just said two things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0209821_0210117 Yeah, that all happens through the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210117_0210615 Mae'r gweithdor yn gwybod beth yw'r ddau sydd eisiau gweld arno.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210615_0211023 or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks at his credit.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213265_0213415 Oh, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213415_0213551 Inside the segment, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0215327_0215467 Ie, dyna'r blynyddoedd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216096_0216266 Yeah, that looks about right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216266_0216811 Ond rwy'n anodd ymlaen am sut i'w wneud ymlaen yma.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216811_0217577 We want all the information about the name, the language, the user.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217577_0217646 Well, we don't do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217863_0218569 Maybe if they know the codes and in other courses.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0219105_0219240 Ie, mae'n dda.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220084_0220230 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220271_0220456 But then, yeah, as I said.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0221530_0222119 No, no, no, I'm not saying you can pick a user, but it should come up with some list.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222119_0222777 but an extended list of the meetings. So you know, you have a BDR, whatever it was called, 01.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222777_0223344 and then it gives you the longer name, blah, and then it gives you the, you know, the participants.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223637_0223889 I don't think so.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223959_0224134 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224134_0224316 But then... Is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224316_0224556 No, it's not at all, I think. It's all true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224556_0224692 I told it, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224692_0224950 I've not tried that yet, but I was going to do it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224950_0225317 Mae'n bwysig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225317_0225963 Yeah, I'm not sure, but is that very... is that not annoying? If you have to... Get out of the bloody way!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225963_0226273 Yes!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226273_0226386 We do that a lot, don't we?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226386_0226994 I ddysgu am unrhyw ddwylo, mae angen i chi gysylltu'r un o'r hyn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226994_0227437 wait for it to pop out. Yeah, that's exactly the way.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0229882_0230290 It would just be nice to have some basic information on.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230290_0230807 Mae'n meddwl y byddai'n cymryd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230807_0230954 Maybe that's the best I did then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230954_0231487 Felly mae gennych chi ddod i'r menyw, y llwybr gweithio, nid y llwybr go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0231713_0231788 and then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232000_0232366 some sort of fields which updates dynamically depending on what you've highlighted.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232710_0232798 Yeah, that sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0233635_0233667 See?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234346_0234496 What does non-nice yourself mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234696_0234930 Not earlier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235811_0235971 Rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwy'n gwybod, rwy'n gwy'n gwy'n gwy'n ddynu, rwy'n gwy'n gwy'n ddynu, rwy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235971_0236358 You've got lots of non-something and then night-something and then end-something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0236758_0236869 One's an interface and one's a...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238062_0238529 And most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying, you've got to update this Jonathan.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238529_0238836 This is unintelligible.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238898_0239158 Great.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0240763_0241021 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241021_0241212 It's not great though.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241212_0241619 Right, so anyone else got anything to say?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0242119_0242579 A allwn ni... Iawn, a allwn ni eisiau unrhyw fath o weithiau yn y ddwy o bwynt?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243033_0243115 Yeah, it's not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243115_0243612 Rwy'n meddwl, rwy'n mynd i'n mynd i wneud gwych gwaith y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwynt y ddwy o bwy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243817_0243898 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244842_0244907 If you like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244907_0245123 Rwy'n gallu ysgrifio hynny ymlaen, os ydych chi'n gwybod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0245675_0245756 What time?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0247755_0248019 I've got a doctor's appointment at 10 to 2.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0250419_0250544 How about...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251067_0251106 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251571_0252344 If one's bad for you, then you're not talking. No, no, that would only give us like 35 minutes. Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252344_0252592 Wel, wel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252592_0252753 like you know five or six.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0253117_0253282 What's three o'clock?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0254517_0254873 I'll write this meeting up and I'll send it to him as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0255359_0256031 Because she's not here. No, I mean, she collected... Oh, right! Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, that's cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256031_0256612 I collect meetings sometimes! I don't know if somebody was collecting them but that's what I thought when you said it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256612_0256834 We should probably do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257021_0257501 So can we just repeat briefly what I was talking about?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257501_0258117 So we've done progress on the speaker characterization. Who does the speaker characterization?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258117_0258709 We mentioned topic labeling with keywords.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258709_0259136 Rydyn ni'n gweithio y bydd y gysylltiad yn rhanfn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0259136_0259489 And Michael, did you have anything?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260473_0260541 Do we just?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260848_0261428 Yn ogystal â'r bwyd, nid oes gennych amser ar y dyn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0261428_0261548 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263546_0263744 I think it would. Also?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263885_0264236 I think it would give you the most relevant result.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0265828_0266434 No, but for things like if you search for language, then you might have, you have some topics which have as a,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0266434_0267224 Some meetings which have as a topic language they specifically speak about language and they use that word like in every sentence.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267224_0267660 A yna mae gennych chi'r hyn sy'n ddweud, yn ddweud, fel un neu ddwyf,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267660_0268069 you know, my language is German or something stupid, but you don't really want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268069_0268282 So you want to distinguish those somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268282_0268379 or nuts anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268695_0268792 Yeah, very easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269326_0269623 If I want to, I'll tell us. We can just do something really simple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269623_0269691 I mean...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272028_0272402 Ie, jyst... Yn ystod hynny, jyst... Yn ystod hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272402_0272761 Yeah, I mean, you just do it really simply, you know?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272761_0273228 We'll have to talk to Pernilla about this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0273228_0273333 We are using that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274023_0274217 It doesn't have to be all intelligent.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274503_0274584 And if the one
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281142_0281256 We'll see you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281256_0281671 Yeah, but there are 75 meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283154_0283256 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283612_0284081 Mae'n bwysig i ni hefyd i ddweud y llyfr y gallai'n cyrraedd yn ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284081_0284542 but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284934_0285207 Mae'n bwysig i chi ddysgu am ddysgu llyfr y dynion.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285410_0285498 Yes, sir.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285850_0286022 We will discuss it again on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0002306_0002541 Mae'n gweithio fel hynny?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0005698_0005937 Ik ga in de...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0009179_0009353 Take just the same things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0010398_0010516 So how are we getting along?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017338_0017486 I want to do a bit of that, see?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017486_0018262 The data processing is fine but I don't particularly want to do the GUI for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018262_0018397 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018397_0019186 Ie, roeddwn i'n meddwl am…
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019186_0019778 I've created two classes, one that represents speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019778_0020295 sy'n cymryd â'r cyfleoedd ac mae'r wybodaeth am ddod o'r ddod yn ymddangos yn ymddangos yn y gwaith.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020295_0020877 Mae'n mynd i'r obiectau a'r obiectau yn ymddygiad â'r wybodaeth am y cyfle a'r cyfle.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020877_0021528 Felly, y gyrfa sydd yn y gyrfa a'u ddod yn ymwneud â'u ddod, a yna'r adnoddau sydd yn ymwneud â'r gyrfa.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021528_0021812 So there's two separate classes, do you see what I mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021812_0021965 And they're two different objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021965_0022709 Mae'n gallu gweithio'r rhai o'r obiectau ac yna rydych chi'n cael'r obiectau yn ôl ac mae'r obiectau sydd wedi'i adnabod yn cael'r wybodaethau y maen nhw'n angen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0022709_0023131 a gallwch chi ddod o fathau i roi beth sydd eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich eich e
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023131_0023532 neu'r hyn, ond dyna beth sy'n dechrau i'r ffordd yw gydag y datblygiad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023891_0024199 Ie, yw'r cyfle y byddwn yn cael ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024199_0024593 ac yn ogystal â'r obiectau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024593_0025389 Mae'n dechrau bod angen i'w ddod yn ystrych a'i ddod yn ystrych ac gallwch chi ddod ymlaen i'w llesio o'r ffactor.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025463_0025733 a hynny'n gweithio'n un o'r tîm i popu'r ddau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025733_0026149 Ond dyna beth y byddwn i'n mynd i'w ddweud, beth y fformat y byddai'r data yn mynd yn ôl.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026149_0026783 because it can come back as almost anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026783_0026961 Mae'n dda iawn i'w ddysgu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0028239_0028328 Yeah, it can.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0029102_0030576 Felly, gallwn i'n ei ddweud fel y bydd yn ei roi i chi, oherwydd ymlaen, ystafellau datblygiadau'n bwysig yw'r teimloedd ar y cyfnodau sy'n dweud, mae'n cael un sy'n dweud ymlaen, ymlaen, ymlaen, ymlaen, ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030576_0030860 1% cwch a 1% cyfrif.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030860_0030913 Do you sell me?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030913_0031695 A yna mae'n cael ymlaen, mae'n cael ymlaen, mae'n cael ymlaen ymlaen a yna mae'n cael eu perthynas i'r hyn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0031695_0032375 Felly gallwch ddod yn ôl fel ychwanegu'r has-degol, neu gallwch ei roi fel vectr ac mae'n dweud noes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032375_0032689 Mae'n unrhyw strin, ddŵr, ex%
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032689_0032977 We'll say a vector that's cool, I don't know, whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032977_0033810 you can either have an embedded vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0033810_0034240 What the easiest thing to do?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0034640_0034795 Yeah, he's hit all the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0035962_0036317 See that's the key. How did we? Look at that again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0036622_0037082 Mae'n y fformat y mae'n ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037082_0037710 Mae'r ddarlith yn y gysylltiad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037768_0038191 Felly, mae'r holl beth sydd wedi'i caliolio hefyd yn ymwneud â'r amser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038191_0038361 Yeah, that's easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038361_0038476 So I'm gonna call it amazing actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038476_0038941 the influences are. I lived in Germany for six months, don't know if that had any effect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038941_0039137 Mae'n dda i ddysgu'r ddau yn ymwneud â'r Brydd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039137_0039381 لا أعرف ما تفعل
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039381_0039876 I don't know what it is people go through.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039876_0040167 Ac mae'r hyn yn cyrraedd hefyd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040167_0040336 All I have to do is get the dialogue out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040336_0040428 So that's the number one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041434_0041734 So then, how is this box populated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041734_0041973 a'r cyfle hwn yn populi'r un o'r un o'r un a gynhyrchu'r un.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042237_0042339 the warm present.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042950_0043546 Oherwydd, ar y moment, mae yna metodau i'w ddweud y ffordd y mae'n ei ddefnyddio i ddwy o'r torth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0043546_0044062 it says like get talk time and you take the name.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044062_0044474 So that that would call that and call the meetings method that's a return now
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044474_0044823 a byddai'n popi fel hynny, a byddai'n dda i'n bwysig i'w gwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044823_0045043 I mean that would
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046352_0046390 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046899_0047044 Yeah, that would be easy as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047199_0047239 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047239_0047777 Felly roeddwn i'n mynd yn llawer o fathau sy'n dod yn unrhyw fath.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047777_0048030 Mae'n bwysig i'w wneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048030_0048200 Okay, yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048700_0048948 Mae'n rhaid i'w gyrraedd i'w gyrraedd i'w gyrraedd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049571_0049713 No, it's still as an object file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049713_0050140 prices a whole lot of line and then they're much much smaller
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050140_0050561 only like a one without one K. So that's all just pre-processed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050561_0050671 Yeah, it is a breaking system.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050671_0050993 ac yna mae'n mynd i'r obiect yn cael ymddygiad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050993_0051116 mae angen i chi gyrraedd y gyrraedd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051116_0051305 It's got a load method.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051305_0051769 Felly, yw gweithio yw gweithio'r gwaith yn unig, oherwydd os yw gweithio'r gwaith yn unig ar gyfer ein cyfleoedd,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051769_0052052 mae'n mynd i'r ddau a'i wneud y proses sy'n mynd i'r obiect ei hunain.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052052_0052355 and then if you call it a Nile Constructor.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052355_0052804 yna gallwch chi ddod o load ar y cyfan neu phoen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052804_0052879 Das ist es.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053397_0053633 Rwy'n oed yn gyfle i'w gweithio.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053683_0053812 Hold that, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053812_0053941 أدأ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054355_0054561 Mae'n dweud chi chi'n ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054561_0055144 Mae'r cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle hwn yn y cyfle h
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055391_0055574 Yeah, yeah, it'll be pretty easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055903_0056071 Ja, daarom niet te zwaar.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056071_0056435 Mae'n bwysig i'r broblem gyda'r unrhyw beth ddim wedi'i ddod o'r bwysig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056752_0056795 Да и и
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056795_0057141 Nid oes yn dda i'n ddifynu'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057141_0057373 Mae rhai o ddifogau yn y ffordd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057373_0057710 Mae'n rhaid i mi ddangos i'w gweithio.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0058924_0059029 Yeah, that would be a problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059029_0059346 a yna gallwch chi wneud ymgyrch ar y cyfle, ar y gweithredu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059346_0059579 because that's the thing these these are so small
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059579_0060210 gallai'n mynd i'r holl arfer a'i ddysgu ar yr holl arfer i ddysgu a yw'r cyfleoedd yn unig, neu bethau yn unig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0060210_0060321 Felly nid yw'n gysylltu'r peth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061027_0061353 Mae'r glen yn cymryd ymlaen i hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061353_0061562 Because they're just for the meat.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061822_0062225 Mae'r cyfleoedd ysbytai'n gwybod am y pethau hynny. A'r cyfleoedd ysbytai'n gwybod am y pethau hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0062858_0063016 No, no, what the hell did you do?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063289_0063528 but we weren't near.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063528_0063805 Roeddwn i'n credu bod yna ddaeth oherwydd yn bwysig, felly roeddwn i'n gwneud hynny ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064279_0064838 No, design the game first. The problem is if you change the classes...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064838_0065272 Mae'r cyfle sy'n cymryd yn anodd ac mae'n gallu ei gysylltu. Felly mae'r bwysig yma ar gael.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065272_0065398 ac na fi ddim yn gweithio'n dda.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065605_0065949 byddai'n mynd yn ymwneud â'r ffordd a'i gwneud yn fwy fwyaf.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065949_0066289 If I gave you one. If I gave you it now and you worked on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066289_0066787 and then I changed it and run the thing again, you would never be able to like the old jazz back up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066787_0067293 a yna bydd angen copi'r holl ffordd o obiectau arall yn ystod. Mae'n ddiddordeb, rwy'n credu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0067637_0068265 But if you want to make a picture, you can do that without anything. What do you mean a picture?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068265_0068459 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068459_0068569 Yeah, but it's not gonna take long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068569_0068860 That doesn't take away.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069110_0069420 Nid oes angen i'r gilydd a'i ddod yn y ffordd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069420_0069766 Ond roeddwn i'n rhaid i ni wneud ychydig o'r hyn i chi ychydig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069766_0069924 oherwydd y byddai'r obiectau yn dda.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0070656_0070793 That is still my home direction.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071077_0071212 응, 안 해
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071212_0071434 O es finista por el glonio, no me lo voy a creer.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089041_0089444 That way it doesn't crash, you try and load all 10 in one, it crashes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089444_0090063 Mae'n bwysig iawn os gallwch chi'n ffwrdd, os gallwch chi gysylltu 10 ffrindiaethau cyhoeddus yn ymgysylltu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090063_0090305 You can do that. Fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090305_0090583 I can't do them. I can't do them if it thinks they're one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090583_0091142 because it's about the amount that each, you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091142_0091801 Ond os ydych chi ddim, roeddwn yn dweud, oes gen i gyd yn ystod, oes gen i gyd yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn ystod, roeddwn yn y
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091801_0091884 Guys
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091884_0092582 Does it talk to you now, does it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0092582_0093326 So nice machine, isn't it? Spent too much time on it, I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094276_0094351 No, de todo, de...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094351_0094424 Yeah, I think too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094645_0094693 They pop up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094693_0094753 It was difficult.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099083_0099438 It's an SD browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099438_0100082 some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0101925_0102381 or a switchboard that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102381_0102717 Lleid i mi gyrraedd, leid i mi gysylltu, leid i mi rhywbeth unrhyw beth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102717_0102797 Whistle a tune.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0105945_0106173 Click on something that's stupid and it's t-series
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106173_0106536 Mae'n angen i chi gael unrhyw ddwylo o hyd i'w gael ymwneud â'r bobl.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106774_0107296 The only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you've loaded an observation.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0107942_0108922 gallwch ddefnyddio'r gweithredu ffyrdd cyfrifiad i'w adnabod y lles o ffyrdd cyfrifiadau ac yna ddefnyddio un o'r hyn i gysylltu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0108922_0109064 под любое...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109368_0109743 It has to be an observation and even if you go, you can go and search the whole corpus from that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109743_0110080 Ond mae'n rhaid i chi gael... Mae'n rhaid i chi gael ymlaen i rywbeth o ran unrhyw rhan.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110080_0110675 Mae'n unrhyw metod ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ymw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110675_0110886 The engine class only has one such engine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0111483_0111596 نعم
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118131_0118293 Doesn't take long to load up anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118293_0118486 You can light the dumb one up, it doesn't have any.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0120372_0120433 이렇게.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121092_0121255 But he gives one at a time anyway, doesn't he?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121255_0121388 otherwise you crush the thing
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0124992_0125139 It's not too slow though, I don't think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125139_0125328 It's not too bad, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125328_0125523 Dwi'n meddwl bod hynny'n bwysig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125936 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130214_0130271 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130271_0130817 Mae'n gwneud ymlaen i'w gwneud yn ymddygiadau i'w gael ymlaen. Ac yna rydym yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymwneud y pethau yn ymw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130817_0130921 One of these.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132245_0132471 Did we think about?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132681_0132824 ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134197_0134354 How do they translate it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134607_0134666 To the next.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134666_0134793 Okay, well that's my little problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134793_0134875 I'm gonna just use that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135077_0135305 That's a working group, is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135332_0135852 I wanna see the videos about Vaven better understand.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0136433_0136556 Okay, that's good, that's good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138033_0138314 So who would have the ideas?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138314_0138521 I'm eating the DS.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138521_0138764 o ran ymddygiadau documentol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139058_0139344 Yeah, to do what Tiske is talking about, you do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139344_0139509 to do the topic later.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0140243_0140790 If somebody's done the keyway, the idea of the DFS already with me, not too probably.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143073_0143304 How do you do an inverted VAR search without the TFID?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143503_0144032 I think you need to do that. Well, it would have been like a whisker.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144032_0144273 the amount that they occur over 10 documents.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144273_0145030 Mae'r amser y mae'r df yn ymwneud â'r amser y mae'r ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o ddwy o dd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0145030_0146188 Mae'r amser yma yn y document a'r amser yma yn y document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0146188_0146938 Felly mae'r bwysau yn cymryd yn cymryd i'w scôr genedlaethol, mae'r bwysau'n bwysig ar gyfer ymddygiadau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147303_0147608 The thing you can't cross is the cork and it's still tight at the end
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147937_0148548 Plus y stop list, felly rydych chi'n mynd i'r bach sydd fel hynny, a byddai'n cael sgwrs ymgysylltu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148743_0148810 These fake top.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148964_0149212 Bunch of keywords. Bunch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149212_0149416 Mae'n dda i'n gwybod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149416_0149507 keywords or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149507_0149838 What's the I in TFIDF?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149838_0149964 Inverse document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149964_0150187 I'r termfrigus, ymwneud y stockynfrigus.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0150429_0150823 I did do it once, I do have a job class that does it for something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0152722_0153001 Also, keywords give you an eye on a whole new type of set.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153001_0153109 See how to do keyway tests.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153109_0153454 Ond gallai'r tebygau cyhoeddus oedd yn ymwneud â'r hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153454_0154048 Yn ystod hynny, roeddwn yn gweithio ar ddwyloedd. Pan fyddai'n teimlo, roeddwn yn teimlo at ddwyloedd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0154203_0154315 Felly, diolch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0155341_0156222 Rwy'n credu bod yn ogystal â'r fforddau'r broses yn ei hunain yn dda.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0156222_0157189 The easy bit is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole occurrences in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157189_0157624 because you don't have to integrate as much information
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157973_0158359 No, you can do search without TFIDF, you just can't rank the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0158970_0159494 No, no, no, but isn't that what the idea was in the first place, to rank the results so that...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160264_0160488 Yeah, but that way it slowed down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160488_0160600 ranking points that down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161107_0161604 It still uses a bit of fiber, but it ranks the results by the amount of fiber. That would just be nice extra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161604_0161818 Roeddwn i'n credu bod hynny'n rhan o'r blynyddoedd, ond oes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162242_0162710 No, we didn't. So what? It's only interim.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162977_0163392 But yeah, I guess if that's not part of it, don't worry about it. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0163561_0163750 because I'm only going to do this for a while.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164726_0164813 We'll just give you a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164813_0165282 That was the whole point. This is your top one, this is your bottom.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166295_0166492 how informative
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166492_0166721 Mae'r tfidf yn sgwrs informatig, yw hynny?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0167959_0168230 It's not a compound.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0168416_0168525 Boleh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169308_0169412 That's a good one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169412_0169892 Well, excuse me. Sunny day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169892_0170033 Bir daha gelecek diye bilgi...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170303_0170774 Mae'n ffordd mwyaf, mae'n gwneud rhan fwyaf ar gyfer un, bob tôn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170774_0171163 You could make it more complicated and make it difficult. Let's not make it more complicated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0171523_0171710 The way we were doing it, we were just looking for...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172042_0172133 Well, that's way we're thinking.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172133_0172283 그리고 다음
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0173224_0174008 I guess I'll just do a sum of the individual TFIDF for each term returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174008_0174408 and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174408_0174774 ac y gwych, mae'r dynau ymddygiol ymwneudol yw'r peth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174957_0175023 I think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175023_0175228 It's pretty crude anyway, this is just looking for...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175414_0175908 it's all it's going to do is look for separate because then it's going to go into the NXT session.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175908_0176137 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176137_0176267 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176267_0176403 So yeah, that's this group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176403_0176608 Um...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177487_0177584 Groups.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177584_0178053 Yeah, without doing any like, um, web page.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0178851_0179386 Yeah, then I... Actually, that's a problem for me too, so...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179386_0179709 That's um... yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179709_0179940 But the idea is that gives you an informative score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179940_0180210 how you combine that is up to you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180210_0180351 I guess there's lots in the list.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180351_0180980 If you were, there's a whole load about it in Manning and Shudder.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180980_0181393 They've got a whole chunk about it. So just IR, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181393_0181581 the second information entry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181581_0181729 Mae'n cael cyfle bach yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181729_0181889 If you haven't got it, it's on Cognac.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182495_0182581 Me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182581_0182878 Hundreds of figures.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0187627_0187906 Do you want that on the start up screen?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188687_0188748 Yeah, I guess I
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188748_0188875 Yeah, I guess that's a good question.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0197880_0198070 You can have it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198070_0198284 I could have a site for myself if it's easier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198795_0199338 Well, I call it favorites.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199338_0199448 You can have a favourite
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199722_0200105 Yeah, it's not enough in relation to... It's not like they come back every day and do the same thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0201502_0201561 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0204803_0204956 Yeah, it would be quite a bit hazy, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0205719_0206009 That's not what I'm suggesting. I'm just saying these are
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207456_0207592 좋아.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207592_0207657 I mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208096_0208257 Rwy'n gweithio.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208257_0208441 So even if it just said two things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208441_0208990 Mae'r un wedi'i dweud, roedd e'n mynd i'r adeiladau i'r cyfnod a chael un texnod, a'i ddod yn y menyw.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208990_0209204 And then another one that said search that led to instant
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209204_0209467 I think I've researched like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209594_0209856 Yeah, or one that, yeah, one that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211013_0211248 Well the only thing to do is just have search as the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211248_0211482 mae'n mynd yn ymwneud yn y pwynt yma.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211482_0211798 and that's the interface. You just go from there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212121_0212516 A yna mae'n mynd i'r brosiell ar ôl i'w gysylltu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212516_0213348 or the search window they could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just and a go button that said take me to this oh i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213348_0213571 So that's the inside the segment.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213571_0214400 So the only thing that comes up when you finish is a, when you start, it's just one window like that. And it's got all the search stuff right down there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214400_0214615 So this is your search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214615_0215164 just over here and here is just go to wherever on the go button.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215164_0215514 Ac yna, oedd e'n mynd i chi i gyd yn y ffordd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215704_0216048 Ac yn y tîm y mae'n dweud, roi'n fawr i'r brans.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0216813_0216963 Good job. Good job, down there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217344_0217656 Ah, you want a hat?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217831_0217942 It was time to come up with a new idea.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0218438_0218515 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219079_0219129 이해종
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219733_0220248 Mae'n dda iawn. Os ydych chi eisiau gysylltu, yw'ch gysylltu. Os ydych chi eisiau edrych ar un cyfle a ddod yn ymwneud â hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220248_0220721 That's true. That's. Oh yes, you have two.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220721_0221165 Mae'r un yna, un yna, mae'n rhaid i chi ddweud, un yna i mi ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221165_0221415 gallwch chi ddod o'r un, gallwch chi ddod o'r un neu'r un.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221415_0221477 Thank you everybody.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221477_0221637 No, no, no.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0223369_0224053 We could do Microsoft's Day and hold it over and it pops up a thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224202_0224302 Is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224883_0225023 Mass over his name.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225023_0225259 Actually, listen. Why don't you do that then?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225832_0226409 Get out of the bloody way I'm trying to say that bit!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227076_0227367 Ie, yw hynny, mae'n bwysig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227367_0227691 So that's why you could just have a list of your users then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227691_0227942 And just to just say I want to look for this user.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228029_0228112 family.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228112_0228471 a yna mae'n mynd i'r lles o'r un sydd wedi cael hynny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228471_0228698 And then you search. But then you need to search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228698_0229192 Maybe just leave it, just have them leading names there and don't worry about the speakers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229192_0229367 If they're doing speakers, they're doing search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229367_0229594 It's not the same. It's doing the quick access.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230146_0230659 Oh you have a text box there. Yeah I'm thinking that, that updates. Yeah as you go over there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230659_0230821 Then that doesn't get in the way.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0232469_0232617 Mae'n dda i'r ffwrdd yna a'r ddod yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233013_0233294 gallwn ni wneud hynny'n gweithio gyda'r hyn yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233465_0233505 I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233723_0233769 Cool
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233769_0233929 I think. No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233929_0234025 a mynd i'r cyfle.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0234538_0234956 I think it's a night object model.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235175_0235508 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddweud yw'r cyfle rhaid i chi ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235508_0235796 Mae'n corffis yng Nghymru a yna mae eich element yng Nghymru.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235796_0236117 You've got a lot of noms on your face.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0236408_0237040 I think the N ones are interfaces and the N one, one of the ways around one's an interface and one's actually an implemented class.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237040_0237498 Because you go back enough and they um, what's his name?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237498_0237773 The API is alright but there's not a lot of description in it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237773_0237959 It's very creepy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237959_0238103 It tells you what.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239098_0239480 So you end up just, it returns a M text box.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239480_0239560 So okay, what's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239583_0240106 It's an implementation of an ntext interface.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240106_0240169 What's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240169_0241198 It's an extended version of it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0242760_0242869 Might be useful, wouldn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0243694_0243809 じゃあ、ちょっと待ってておくね
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0244908_0245011 I forgot something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246177_0246362 Just off the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246973_0247021 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247021_0247144 What that means is to write it down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247460_0247646 Do it for the world.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247646_0247742 Yeah, that could be funny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248492_0248785 Friday morning?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248940_0248994 Are you?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249148_0249215 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249215_0249491 Maybe I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0250517_0250815 So we say 3 o'clock and then if there's a serious problem I'll tell you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252439_0252628 Smael am y ticrwydd ydyn ni.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252792_0252904 I think it's better than fancy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253216_0253648 Just say 3 o'clock and then if there's a problem with that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253648_0254165 Mae'r pwmpen ar 3 o'r oed yn unrhyw fath o'r pwmpen ar 5 o'r oed yn unrhyw fath.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254165_0254342 But I don't think that will be an option.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254982_0255215 Is she collecting them? No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255215_0255501 You just sent it to her. Because she's not here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255501_0255898 I mean, that you collected... Oh right, oh yeah, sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256003_0256253 I collect meeting subjects!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256327_0256480 I thought somebody was collecting them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256480_0256648 But that's what I thought we'd do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256898_0257262 then we know who's missed them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268426_0268832 Yeah, that would help. For single terms, it would be very useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268832_0269419 for multiple terms unless you want to do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0269767_0270631 Or you could do it and override it by the... You could just ignore the ranking if it doesn't show up together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0270631_0270975 or you could have you could penalize it you could just put a blame to do the surgery
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271207_0271446 Yeah, you do the NXT shirt, so it doesn't show up together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271446_0271683 either disregard it or put a weighting against it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271683_0271921 So how many pairs you get?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272131_0272336 Yeah, so then just push next.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272981_0273098 Yeah, that's good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274286_0274539 Some things you're going to get a lot of results for.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274539_0274873 And if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom, then it was actually the most relevant one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274873_0275008 Something that would not push it up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276454_0276627 Mae'n dda iawn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276627_0277014 and also with there's something like sunny day
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277014_0277640 the if sunny and day aren't mentioned together a lot but sunny types of questions once
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277640_0277942 that its turn will be low and it will push down the other one if you combine them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277942_0278075 if you stick together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279124_0279167 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279167_0279738 ond ti ddim yn system gynnyddio o'r amser, felly os oes rhywbeth yn unrhyw beth yn gynnyddio'r cymorth yn dda o'r TFIBF.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279738_0280798 gallai ei gynnal oherwydd y gallai ei ddod o'r botwm. Rwy'n meddwl bod yn unig, a oes gennych gynnydd i gynnydd i gynnydd i gynnydd i 75 meiniadau?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281067_0281627 I don't know what we're doing. Yeah, there are 75 meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281627_0281677 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281996_0282399 Felly, os ydych chi'n dod yn 75, oherwydd, dim ond y byddwch chi'n dod?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282399_0282559 How do you rank them or something?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282559_0283107 When it turns 20, even if it turns 20, do you cut it off at 10? Do you rank them? Do you...? Yeah, that's true. Okay. What's the threshold?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283107_0283196 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283425_0283566 Dat is helemaal mooi.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283566_0283669 It would be useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287489_0287536 Is that it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287733_0287945 Done.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0288070_0288203 It's time to 40.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0004764_0005099 Do you have any comments?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0005099_0005160 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0006711_0006820 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0010769_0011623 One thing that I was wondering is there standard control that you use to connect the different things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0011623_0012020 like if you're in the topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012020_0012646 Is there a particular type of control? Like is there one of these NXT, or sorry, night controls?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012646_0012722 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0015854_0016228 You haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016228_0016669 like other topics or what we're going to do for speaker I guess.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016669_0016708 Right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016779_0017338 Well, okay. When we talk about speaker characterization, how are we accessing the list of speakers?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026808_0026979 This is the best thing that I've ever done.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026979_0027329 like when he was talking about like having architecture that things are going to plug into.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027329_0027798 I mean, so that things are all modular. I mean, it would be a good idea if we use that same idea for anything else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027798_0027954 What else are we doing?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027954_0028342 Yeah, even the searches or whatever. Yeah, can you think?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0028342_0028849 I mean search results if they're all in a predictable thing with a name, certain properties or listed properties.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0033745_0033849 Have I?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034053_0034342 How you wanna use the plate?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034378_0034788 It's just a matter of deciding what would be easiest. All the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049224_0049723 So each time are you going straight to the XML files for the information? No, there's still an object file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049723_0049757 This is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049757_0049850 a whole lot of learning
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049850_0049965 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049965_0050004 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050258_0050422 Without 1k.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050422_0050663 So that's all just pre-processed? Yeah, just pre-processed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051309_0051345 So what you do is you take a little bit of the white and you take a little bit of the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051959_0052044 of general, right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0052811_0053116 Is it for the entire corpus?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053116_0053476 Or is it just like individual ones, like one object for? One object for each of these.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053476_0053540 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053540_0053686 한 번 더 해볼게
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053919_0054132 I wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054132_0054324 Right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054355_0054385 It's just...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054871_0054911 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0056609_0057022 Or just return a null or a blank or whatever. No, top-specified idea. I have a default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0060208_0060258 So it doesn't
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071484_0071909 Actually, I can upload my stuff as well. I just have to make one change to your phone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071909_0072240 just to load this one instead of the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0072240_0072566 So, that's two lines of code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073070_0073163 Um, what do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073336_0073698 Well, yeah, just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074114_0074311 Well, you're a person.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074427_0074693 I did in my directory.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074876_0075176 Um, I have a copy, yes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075176_0075245 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075245_0075906 But I was going to update that one. It just makes sense that... Well, just tell me when because I usually...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076114_0076300 And then update.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076547_0076744 Ie, rwy'n meddwl y byddwn yn gwneud ymdrech.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076744_0076902 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076902_0077102 I'll just make that one and let you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077311_0077597 Like I said, two lines of code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077597_0078132 And then you can play.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078132_0078233 There's not much to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078233_0078625 I have to get better results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078938_0079543 Yeah, and just to wire in the topics and we do them in some ways.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0079543_0080115 I mean the highlighting stuff. Well also yeah like that as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080115_0080211 So yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080297_0080874 and just wanna find out what kind of objects those were for the other ones.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080874_0081304 So it goes even higher.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0082326_0082359 different
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085593_0085681 Okay, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085892_0086548 Okay, there's a few more things to do with that. And then now once Panela gets the index.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086548_0086820 then that's gonna be kind of fun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086820_0087170 I'm just wondering if you had to, well the way you're doing it, I was gonna ask if the way you were doing it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087170_0087588 reloading like a new corpus each time for each meaning but you're doing the objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087588_0088289 So you don't need to just, cause if we, if we do have like the inverted search says that there's young people.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0088289_0089001 documents are we going to have to load each of these 10 core points just to do the individual next t-search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0089380_0089533 He probably...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090150_0090373 Fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090373_0090406 I'll do the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090860_0091294 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o ddod o
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091294_0091408 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091738_0092049 Otherwise the guy's, oh no.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0093795_0093898 I can feel that in now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099112_0099725 It's an SD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099725_0099959 I know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099959_0100154 It doesn't take two months.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100154_0100590 We have to, while we're debugging.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100590_0100987 But something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103440_0103544 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103783_0103949 And that because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104515_0104905 I was just going to ask if we should assume that they'll want to load a meeting first, but not necessarily.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104905_0105239 I guess if you're doing a search on the entire.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0105765_0105892 And through that one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0106555_0106792 Well, we can put the chicken in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107270_0107714 I could probably even. That shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107714_0107884 And if it hasn't loaded, then force them to load it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111723_0111938 Unless they know what meaning it is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111938_0112083 لقد أخذت مني
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0113546_0114127 Or, well, the things that may just be looking for a word, and, you know, if it shows up 10 different meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114127_0114868 Then at that point, they'll probably want to, like, do we want to, like, if it done by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114868_0114978 I'm gonna have to go through.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115184_0115431 Well, like to a lot of like the thing is, I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115580_0116003 Like when it loads up, it'll load up the transcript window and whatever other window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116003_0116206 Right now I think just the topic ones.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116206_0116826 Although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116826_0117456 So I'm just thinking if it's kind of like you were saying, you have to have a norm object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117456_0117835 I mean, before you do, you search it all. Yeah, but local search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117876_0117953 Candle level.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117953_0118007 That's right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118453_0118825 Yeah, but the, okay, the global one feeds into the local.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118825_0119318 So if we're getting any useful data, it's going to be doing a search on each of those files.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0119318_0119664 So it's going to be loading up each of those one at a time to get the data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0120470_0120896 But it could be time consuming, like if there are 10 documents that paper is in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121424_0121743 Um, yeah, well, just thinking of some way we could, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121743_0122317 catch the results in a nice little format that will make things a bit easier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0122317_0123043 But the thing is, I mean, if we've got that, then it's going to be needing really to load the entire corpus for that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123043_0123539 if it's trying to show us where those were, if it's trying to highlight those in the text or transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123539_0123775 And we're going to have to have all that other game.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123775_0124048 So each time when we have the surgeon going, we have like,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124048_0124307 attend different meetings, the word wireless comes up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124307_0124688 Go to meeting one in Hestel, the normal object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124688_0124836 Next one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124836_0125272 I mean, that's kind of... Yeah, it's not too slow though, I don't think. It's not too bad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125272_0125338 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125539_0126076 It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least, like that's all. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126076_0126392 Test it, try some other ones, and shut down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126392_0126975 Yeah, so just sort of based on that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126975_0127464 But if it doesn't take that long each time, then it should be alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0128741_0128774 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0129973_0130006 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0130824_0131060 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131060_0131406 And that way they know specifically which meaning it is. I'll save the time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131406_0131880 Because I'm sure they don't want to have the extra loading time either. They can avoid it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131880_0132180 So yeah, or they can check mark, I think it's the ones they want to check.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0132988_0133108 I think they were in the text room.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0133108_0133838 We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of BDB, you don't just do a stream.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134088_0134278 Did they? Did they?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134278_0134441 That's nice.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134441_0134649 Like the working group that it's part of.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134767_0134902 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135309_0135394 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135999_0136107 If it's accurate.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0138712_0139019 Do we actually need the frequencies?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139480_0139554 Oh, right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139574_0139634 Okay, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140160_0140436 Well, the thing is, if it's being done... If somebody's done the key by so...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140755_0141096 There's a class she was trying to get to work on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141096_0141729 They did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141729_0142205 But it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff, but at the last I heard it wasn't working.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142205_0142825 So she's going to look at more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142825_0143125 But if we need the frequencies.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143368_0143467 Um, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143784_0144054 Well, it would have been like a list of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0144389_0144452 What does that stand for?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147353_0147533 Korkunçlu
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147533_0147825 Well, you know, it's fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147825_0148187 Plus y stoplis, fel y gallwch chi ddysgu pethau fel y gallwch chi ddysgu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0149632_0149922 What's the I in TFIDF? Inverse document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0150668_0150690 something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158468_0158525 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158525_0158712 Yeah, that's why I'm thinking too. Do we need to?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158712_0159014 I mean, we're just looking for your stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0159014_0159111 No, but that's what this is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0161982_0162591 I don't think we had that in the document. No we didn't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162649_0162718 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162718_0162746 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0163504_0163648 Yeah, thanks.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0164960_0165013 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165013_0165350 actually because things I mean this is your top one this is your bottom yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165350_0165897 But the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting, if they're looking for a particular term or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165897_0166317 They just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and I want to see it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0167571_0168186 If it's like a two word term does a TFIDF come down?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168186_0168529 It's not a compound noun, it's just two words together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168529_0168814 Um... I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168814_0168924 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168924_0169280 to something like Edinburgh University.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169446_0169675 Well, that's what any of us do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169675_0169803 Sunny days.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169803_0169843 So you're good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0170922_0171222 Let's not make it more complicated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171385_0171739 Because the thing is that we were just looking for the words.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171739_0172055 period each word in the index.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172055_0172193 That's the way we were thinking.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172193_0172508 And then it's just saying, were these two words in any of these documents?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172508_0173238 if it wasn't, we'd go closer and do the NXT search. Yeah. So look for the exact term or the regular expression or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0175914_0176170 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176170_0176242 That's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176617_0176931 I'm just wondering if it's going to give us something cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176931_0177652 But if it's sort of like, if the NXT search has still got to be run to find these terms or these groups of terms.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0177957_0178333 Or also, like, do wild cards work for something like that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178333_0178889 So if you're looking for wireless wired wire, blah, blah, blah, you can do wire with a star.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178889_0179192 Actually, that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179192_0179324 So, work.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179324_0179364 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179683_0179870 But the idea is that gives you the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180329_0180467 It's trying.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180467_0180583 Okay, if you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180583_0180653 2월 1일에
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181036_0181057 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181454_0181530 I actually...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181880_0182342 Yeah, I've got somewhere. PDF.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182591_0182876 Hundreds of figures.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182876_0183163 Do the PDF, switch it to Postscript, switch it back to PDF.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183580_0183640 Ugh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183640_0183894 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0184522_0184819 How? Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0186835_0186923 Pretty.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0187258_0187797 Probably for the most part. I mean there'll be a set of people that do it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188405_0188759 search for stuff start working yeah i guess i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188759_0189152 Okay, like search, browse.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189349_0189594 Like if you're looking for something specific, like is that what you're thinking?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189594_0190013 Like if they know exactly where they want to go, they want to go to that meeting on December 3rd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190401 They just go there and see stuff then they can go and browse. Yeah, I want to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0191972_0192304 Browse by meeting, browse by blog, browse by speaker.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192304_0192679 Like, no, I'm just thinking of different ways we can do that, like different buttons on the top.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192679_0193086 like if they're looking for a particular person, particular working group, particular whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193086_0193671 And we just, we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193671_0193905 where we could keep it more general.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195177_0195627 Yeah, but I'm just thinking like initially when they load up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195627_0195904 What are the range of things that they'd want to do?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195904_0196265 Like if they're part of X working group, they'll want to get in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196265_0196481 Do we want to save preferences?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196786_0197287 Well, if they're part of BDB working group, they're going to want to look at the BDB ones and so we'll default to that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197287_0197384 Mm-hmm.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197610_0198058 based on what they did last time. They can have a say, preferences.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199005_0199280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199424_0199910 Just scroll down the list and find your favourite one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200239_0200457 Могу я сошить?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200457_0200585 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200585_0200849 I forgot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200922_0201065 Ok
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201065_0201541 Well, no, I'm just getting back to sort of what could be on the startup screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201541_0201912 like there's just a range of things we could do. We could have like search options, browse options.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201912_0202445 I'm just playing around with ideas
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0202445_0203527 And then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say, well, if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203527_0203630 and then do this blah blah blah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203630_0203968 So we can sorta guide them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203968_0204271 It's just like, hey, my task is to do this, and there's a button for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204271_0204383 Perfect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204383_0204496 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204496_0204529 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204529_0204737 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205682_0205884 No, ale znam rany, oczywiście.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205884_0206558 I'm just saying, like these are just like a lot of programs, well kind of lame programs do have that sort of thing first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0206558_0207407 just because they don't want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the program.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207407_0207598 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207992_0208211 Probably we'll search something. We'll search. Yeah, we'll search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209137_0209471 I just instantly search like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209471_0209691 Yeah, that's the music, so I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0210971_0211077 Such as pretty.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217577_0217753 Well, we don't actually have usernames, do we?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217753_0218050 Aren't all these codes?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218519_0218657 In a case like that, we do want to drop down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218657_0218789 We don't want them to type from doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219359_0219525 and allow multiple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219563_0219865 Okay, you're just looking for one specific.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0221052_0221142 Amazing what this is
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0224492_0224581 A tool too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0227069_0227251 Yeah, that's true, that's in the way.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230548_0230731 Bu bir şey değil
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230731_0230930 Maybe that's the best idea then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234609_0234815 object model.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234815_0235146 I think in that case it's the right corpus.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235146_0235208 No
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235208_0235417 Ie, mae'n rhaid i chi ddod oedd y cyfle rhaid i chi ddod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0236358_0236513 Yeah, I think the N ones
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0239953_0240051 I remember.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240638_0240914 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240914_0240980 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0241644_0241921 I'm really just gonna keep on going
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0242621_0243025 Might be useful, wouldn't it? Like Friday afternoons.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0243877_0244106 Then we won't have to have the meeting with Steve on Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244106_0244159 portal.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244241_0244628 So do we want to arrange this, get this one earlier?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244628_0244888 Three? If you like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245098_0245167 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245587_0245678 Okay, yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246596_0246706 Possibly
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246706_0246996 Usually by the end of the month, so I need a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246996_0247596 Although I don't know because it's the lab and trying to get some work done for the lighting stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248060_0248216 Okay. Right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248216_0248298 And...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248688_0248940 3 o'clock?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248940_0249187 Are you ready?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249187_0249353 Maybe I think I'm not sure
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249353_0249436 Classic.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249767_0249998 I think she's got a class at 11.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249998_0250371 with all that 12, three, four, seven, plus 12.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250371_0250565 How about...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250776_0250894 Or if we could try one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250894_0251001 We could try shortly after.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251001_0251148 One, yeah, one, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251148_0251339 Well, it wouldn't be a long meeting, though.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251339_0251379 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251379_0251707 Would you want to? No, probably not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251707_0251921 If one's bad for you then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252235_0252278 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252855_0252933 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259469_0259873 There's just sort of the basic implementation stuff that I was removing from.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259873_0260094 But it should be fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260094_0260376 Това е профессията.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260376_0260692 Do we decide whether to be ranked?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260798_0260979 Really? Oh well, basically.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0261426_0262136 Well, I kind of think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262136_0262837 just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document, it's not really getting them together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262837_0263091 like if someone's looking for a particular term.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263091_0263526 I don't know, just don't know if it would bring us that much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263668_0263708 Also.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264093_0264561 If they're looking for, like I say, a sunny day and...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264561_0264931 Sunny shows up in this document, Dave shows up with them up together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264931_0265179 or if they're
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0265179_0265811 It just doesn't, you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up, it shows up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0268462_0268812 For single terms it would be very useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0269500_0269766 to do something really simple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270757_0270985 penalize it you could just put a blank in the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270985_0271210 which is still through the NXT search line.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271210_0271367 Yeah, you do the NXT shirt, so it doesn't...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271367_0271506 together either just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271599_0271853 waiting and how many pairs you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271853_0272207 It wouldn't show up on the search results if it didn't exist.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0272813_0273225 We'll have to talk to Pernilla about this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0273225_0273883 We are using that. I mean, it does make sense for that, but... Actually...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274305_0274557 Some things you're going to get a lot of results for.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274879_0275247 I mean if it's well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275247_0275434 Yeah, okay, search me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275434_0275852 I think we can actually put that on the list of meetings that get returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275852_0276514 there were 15 meetings of languages in, and it's going to show you those and rank them as to which is the highest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0276514_0276625 That's okay, I see that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278040_0278313 Well, the thing is, I mean, that'll be exactly how we're doing it now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278313_0278617 Like we're just looking for the two words separately, see if they exist in the same document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278617_0278907 and if they do, then there's a possibility that they occurred together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278907_0279111 and then we do the annexes right on that document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0279318_0279373 moments.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280821_0280998 We'll break down, it's not doing anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280998_0281269 I don't know what we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281269_0281344 Pretend.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281344_0281597 There are 75 meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281597_0281750 Yeah. Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0282891_0282954 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0283224_0283732 Mae'n bwysig hefyd i'w gweithio arall.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0287628_0287707 Yep.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0002063_0002511 It's good every time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0004128_0004707 Oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0006734_0007677 Too slippery.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0007677_0008425 Maybe I'll just sit here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0008425_0008509 How do you own that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0011420_0012024 Was that an answer? No, that's just summary. No. No. I'll do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012024_0012207 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012207_0012328 Oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019391_0019703 See you in the next one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019703_0020121 Good peach deer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0021504_0021700 I think I'm just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0024953_0025451 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0026983_0027218 Should run the aisle.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0028081_0028133 No.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0035739_0035785 unique.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0039504_0039938 But that took me so long to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0042040_0042072 haven't done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0052524_0052865 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0068919_0069261 I'm all interested in this guy because he seems to be funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0069261_0070287 It's taking till next joke. That would be quite good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0084666_0084871 Yeah, the top left.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087192_0087460 We have a pink yellow one there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087460_0088218 I've never asked him that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0088236_0089082 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0089082_0089224 아
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0095446_0096325 We have to remember to include that in our evaluation. How did the GIF improve your browsing? Yes!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0099902_0100259 I guess that's why we have a separate speech lab.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0100305_0100661 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0101446_0102253 I'm running some troubles with the indexing but found another package instead of writing it from scratch.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0102253_0102750 I don't know. Just know that I haven't put on it much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0103034_0103425 We'll see what happens in the next few days.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0104085_0104232 أكثر من...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0105967_0106108 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108083_0108360 I didn't expect this cross to be so much of a job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108360_0109058 Yeah, that's it. It feels like it's a job of course. It's a job of course. We don't have anything else.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0109058_0109200 practical
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0114513_0115039 I thought we changed it to Friday. Yeah, I thought we changed it to the 10th or something.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120594_0120764 and that will give us the hope that it's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121032_0121596 I've got my DNLG presentation up on there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121596_0121866 Too much now.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0123581_0123733 Just wait.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0126447_0126523 Well, sort of.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0127211_0128210 The thing is, we're going to get an email and see. We're looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0129220_0129630 Well, they're gonna use me
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0129630_0130067 So they should set up the perception projects and things like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0130067_0130510 It's not going to take long. It's only going to be half an hour.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0130510_0130868 We need to use each other.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0131225_0131608 Have more of a break.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0152986_0153581 That's why I'm trying to find this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154016_0154252 I don't have a big party on the 21st.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154557_0154768 End of lectures.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0155606_0155728 Oh, it's actually 24.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160131_0160714 Did he say anything about what he expects of the final report and stuff?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160714_0160855 Like nerves.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162302_0162513 Although it's 50%.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162725_0162808 But we can...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0163258_0164252 We have an interim report of seven pages and that's weekly. Seven pages? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164252_0164518 We could probably just expand that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164660_0164909 I mean, a lot of it is going to be the same thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165229_0165633 And then, I mean, write about the evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165633_0165800 Yeah, that could be.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165915_0166112 I don't think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166261_0166473 I'm sure you're just gonna be.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0198555_0199395 It should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries from using that text extractor thingy you wrote, right?

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200307_0200435 for me.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0217410_0217555 Praise God.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0217789_0217848 and we'll be.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0217989_0218044 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0219012_0219251 We can just email if we need to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0219589_0219664 I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0002312_0002562 Oh dear, I said that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0002952_0003133 But three. Three right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0003133_0003297 Ychwanegwch yn ystod y cyfle hwn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0003494_0003547 My boots.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0004996_0005368 Ah, Sabotage.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0007291_0007454 Yeah, mine is the same today as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0010815_0011006 Who wants to write some written?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0011888_0011939 I'll do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0012734_0013051 Have you changed the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013694_0013806 Yeah, I forgot that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013999_0014535 No, when you said at the beginning I thought, must check the rewrite.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0017326_0017558 - 私も。
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0018698_0018894 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0019388_0019671 I see that like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020309_0020675 There is a file in the directory called Disfull.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020863_0020953 I
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022810_0022869 I do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022869_0023008 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023380_0023460 Alright.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023621_0024047 Mae'n rhaid i ni ddod oedd yna.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025012_0025312 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025312_0025661 They lived there but I had even more stuff there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0026400_0026858 What? Actually, do you know how much we have? It's huge. Okay. So we probably want to...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0027366_0027487 Yes, sir.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028244_0028456 Has anyone had time to play with it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028841_0028914 and comments.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0030210_0030251 I want to keep
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031013_0031119 Might as well, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031119_0031314 Doesn't really do anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031314_0031602 The thing is that yeah, there is, as I said a while ago,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031602_0032314 there is still this one error which is a bug in NXT and that always generates these.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032314_0032693 I think when you left click or right click or something, I'll cut around the nose.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032835_0033593 But if it's a real error then it stops.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035556_0035682 Yeah, it'll be good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035682_0036229 Is there any comments you have about just like wedding or some sort of minor things?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0036931_0037073 A lot of this JavaScript.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037073_0037439 Yn y cyfle hwn, mae'r holl ddau yn popio yn dda iawn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037439_0038026 but I would make them a bit nicer if I had more time but at the moment it doesn't look like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0038026_0038251 No, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0039715_0040133 But that took me so long to do this blow start, didn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040229_0040610 So I'm quite glad that it looks nice on one row and all this kind of thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040826_0040967 No, this is just, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043111_0043280 That's all I can say.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043872_0044186 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0044186_0045922 I've done some like couple of them. It really speeded up. Try that a few times. Yeah, I started using your, I don't know if you've seen that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046694_0046770 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046770_0046985 Ond mae'n dda, mae'n dda i chi.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046985_0047241 It's got a good interface and easy to use.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0047241_0047277 Nice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050087_0050345 So I'll go to that and then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050983_0051183 It's when they say mm-hmm, uh-huh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051521_0051791 I don't know, it's just everyone is in.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051791_0051870 It's very
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0052391_0052733 Is that a sleeper thing?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0053528_0054020 Felly, gallwch chi gwybod y pethau y byddai'n dda i'w ddod o'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054020_0054141 like three or four.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054999_0055042 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059149_0059684 I mean do we care if you know? I don't know, it doesn't really matter. I think it would be difficult.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059782_0060580 But it would be difficult if in the speaker characterisation window we had a heading in a top five dialogue act.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0060580_0061211 and then the little brackets but they're not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0062130_0062233 I'r ysbicwyr.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063316_0063513 No, I wouldn't. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063921_0064001 when it comes out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064597_0064749 ac yna'r rest yw...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064997_0065404 Yeah, just do top five, both local and global and then have another.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0065511_0066137 But then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0067354_0067828 I'm falling for this one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068535_0068751 Yes, that's what speaker categorisation gives you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068933_0068999 Who's the Wimps?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0070291_0071373 So is this percentage then? If you say like joke for this speaker is percentage
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0071373_0072234 I don't know, 20. Is that the... What percentage of his speech is joke or... What percentage of the dialogue is jokes?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0072390_0072533 yn y cyfle.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0076024_0076748 Mae'n dda i'n gweithio ar y cyfle.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079148_0079241 You will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079655_0079701 So good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0080298_0080635 Yeah, I was thinking that. It sort of turned out that way, didn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081393_0081435 I'm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081435_0081503 It doesn't matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081701_0081788 Oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0083604_0084156 I have one question that I reckon we should have a little icon for my browser.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084458_0084804 Wel, nid. Yn y cydnabod.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084804_0085504 At the moment they've got an X which is, you know, NXT and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that. Yeah, it was something else.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0085748_0086228 No... I meant something original.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086228_0086606 I would suggest.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086606_0086931 The only thing I could think of was an M. Yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0087488_0088107 What am I seeing out before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089655_0089703 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089864_0090401 Mae'n bwynt yn yw, gallwn ni ddod yn un o'r ffaith yn unrhyw ffaith.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0090996_0091065 Videoyu...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092316_0092511 All os ydych chi'n gadael rhywbeth, gwybwynti'n i mi.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092623_0092786 Felly, rwy'n mynd i'r holl ffordd o'r holl ffordd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093222_0093399 Tamam, tamam.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093399_0093461 really easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094007_0094383 Yeah, yeah, I know how to put it there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094383_0094598 Ond roeddwn i'n mynd i'w gweithio'n dda.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094598_0094669 ma non può ciò
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094912_0095078 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0096698_0096891 Oh, yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0097278_0097652 Velkommen til at møde med mig. Kan man få hård hår på disse machine? Nej.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0098936_0099810 if the sound card is registered to your name, which it usually is not. And you have to reboot, and sometimes it doesn't work.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0109184_0109734 In fact it's an NXT package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110371_0110848 I mean sometimes I have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110848_0111427 I think it was like, right, I'll try this then and see what it does.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0114594_0114697 I thought we said
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116565_0116699 Like a tea.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116932_0117417 Well that's the problem because Steve hasn't given us any details, has he?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118045_0118119 That's sort of
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118486_0118681 I'm sure we could do that in a meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118798_0118957 Just brainstorm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119308_0119597 The thing is, yeah, we had the deadline last Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119597_0120310 but we won't be able to do an evaluation during the weekend anyway. So I think we could set Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0120589_0120727 And that will give us the whole chance.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124504_0124539 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124539_0124631 I think that's why I'm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125696_0125814 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125814_0126195 At the end we'll say, you never gave us any tests or things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126439_0126709 Well, sort of. That's how I understand. He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126709_0126933 He would make something up. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126933_0127272 Yeah, find some people. That's how I used to do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0127272_0127400 The thing is, you know,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0128207_0129005 I think if we don't get anything from him then we should just do our friends basically.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0129539_0129786 Both are your friends.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130084_0130181 It's so good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130181_0130389 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0131849_0132005 Like highly computer like
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132005_0132102 When they will be.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132203_0132302 It doesn't have to be you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0133368_0133554 I was thinking of like 10
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135493_0135700 How can you get a range of people if you have three?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135848_0136057 Look at all the students.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137042_0137183 There should just have two.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137207_0137686 My bad one wasn't good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0138306_0139183 Unrhyw beth. Mae'r cyfleoedd yn 1.5 weithiau neu rhywbeth.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139183_0139283 Nearly two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139470_0139766 Oh, it's true. Yeah, it's two weeks then.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139766_0140033 Do we have to have done the evaluation by then?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141001_0141075 I understand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141075_0141211 That was the third thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141211_0141299 Yeah, that's the best.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141791_0141925 Is that good Friday?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0142694_0142974 Well I'm sure on the website it says Thursday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0143656_0144109 Mae'r cwestiwn yw, a oes gennym y gweithredu ar y cyfle?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144673_0144807 We should definitely ask him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144807_0144937 Because if not, then...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0146055_0146174 Yeah, you might be right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0147522_0147750 Because we needed to write a presentation as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148526_0148668 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148668_0148771 That's the point.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0149119_0149585 Well, I'm not free after this Monday, but I'm free after. Oh, the next one. OK.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0150257_0150782 I mean, I'm not even breathing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0151069_0151276 That's in on the 18th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0152163_0152341 So, um...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0155338_0155536 I know I fancy writing them in email.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0156342_0156473 Да, да.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157162_0157354 But it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157354_0157436 a part of the demonstration.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157584_0157793 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157793_0158247 I mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158247_0158353 and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158660_0158735 What was the other one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158872_0159599 Felly, sut yw'r berson yn ymwneud â'ch ymgyrch?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0159599_0160018 A oes gennym bobl sydd wedi'i hysglu ar ein bod yn ymwneud?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0161530_0161870 Do we know, did he ever say how long it was supposed to be?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162181_0162365 Das ist mein Haube.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162784_0162869 But we can write a lot.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162869_0163120 I think we should write everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0164008_0164164 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0165590_0165676 Yeah, we think it's going to be
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0166237_0166299 I should use
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167052_0167284 So do you want to write me an email then? Sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167284_0167326 Let me get you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167850_0168296 and when I get home today which will be before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0168622_0169192 Before I pass 6, I will make that file readable, writable and everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169318_0169404 Bye!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169404_0169517 Well, I will...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169906_0170600 Well I will need your snippets of code or it would be good if I had them by tomorrow evening.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0170935_0171105 Oh, I was gonna ask, um...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171289_0171434 At the moment your search window.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171565_0171657 How's it organized?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172507_0172809 But at the beginning, when you haven't searched yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172809_0173357 Mae'r balon yma i'r 2 a'r gwnes yma yn ddod o?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0173882_0174181 And then if you, I don't know, double click on one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0175887_0175963 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0176802_0177381 Well, that's the icon by the way. Yeah, I do. Beautiful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0177559_0178451 Yeah, maybe you want to do left handed. Yeah, one left click highlights the result in whatever you've got open.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178805_0178847 together.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178969_0179185 various like different topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0179185_0179812 Usually one left click it's highlights it, cross highlights everything. I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181008_0181185 Well, it's difficult because...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181679_0181767 What did you look at?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182347_0182533 No, it's difficult.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182533_0182797 because the transcription window does cross highlighting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182924_0183290 in a very awkward way because he has to find the topic first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183290_0183584 That was a pain.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183744_0184682 and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0184682_0185363 And that works when you left double click on a topic, on a meeting, sorry, then it loads it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185470_0185530 so you can
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185645_0185769 You could take that for loading.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185971_0186525 So if we have that the same on this one, at least that you, if you double left click, then it loads.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187847_0187994 Highlights, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187994_0188550 I mean, obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here. But also highlights
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0188848_0188969 Actually it's difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0189484_0190231 Because you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be open. Well, I suppose if you have a local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190231_0190333 yna gallai'n gweithio ar y llwybr.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190932_0191506 Oherwydd, os ydych chi'n mynd yn ôl o ran o brydau gwahanol yma, a dwi wedi cael unrhyw fath o fath o'r hyn, gallwch chi ddod o'r hyn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0193267_0193395 What do you mean by that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0194506_0194561 So come on.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0195663_0195780 Oh, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0196279_0197295 well in any case if you left click on on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open then it should cross highlight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0197295_0197410 If not, you can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200617_0200677 Can you make a
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200781_0201493 Is it very difficult to make another GUI but only for a global search?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0201930_0202490 Just take that away, the local checkbox.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202490_0202650 Kuzuda da
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202772_0202979 Ie, oherwydd ymlaen ysgolion y gallwch ei gael.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203231_0203342 Yeah, would you make that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203342_0203575 That's quite strong for me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203575_0203798 Everything else can just stay the same, you know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203798_0204134 In fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbox.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0204584_0204934 Where are you going?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0216087_0216123 We're done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007053_0007312 Oh, that's her head. She doesn't see first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007312_0007390 I'm gonna stay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0011917_0012147 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0017470_0017772 It's just, it seems a little chaos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0019495_0019601 See you in a bit.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0020970_0021307 except Excel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0022410_0023001 It doesn't have anything in it. It has about three lines of XML that doesn't do much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023214_0023273 What's that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023775_0024183 Just to be occupied.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024183_0024302 Ez fesztő, lehet az benne működni.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024302_0024419 You
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024562_0025175 I had lots of stuff in there yesterday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025175_0025310 It's just dumb.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025310_0025643 They live there but I have even more stuff there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025643_0025952 I was unzipping all these kind of crazy huge things that were in the box.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025952_0026083 I needed them, they were for this though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0026083_0026667 It's all right about that. I was recording that. What did you actually do?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027076_0027357 Mae'n 8 gigau arno.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027357_0027476 So yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027476_0027982 Siis ma ollevahe või või.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028614_0028945 I had a play of it. Yes please. Any comments?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028945_0029123 Uh, no, it's good really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029123_0029191 Yeah, that's it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029599_0030007 It generated a lot of exceptions in the background.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0030007_0030205 But that didn't cause any problems.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033280_0033537 Yeah, I didn't discover any of those.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033537_0033821 Päätinamalaiske.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033821_0034404 Roeddwn i'n hoffi i'w gweld a fyddwn i'n ei wneud. Dwi ddim yn gweithio ymlaen. Mae'n dda i'n dda iawn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034404_0034674 And the startup screen is going to get pixel, right?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034674_0034783 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036267_0036363 No, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036363_0036835 Mae'r ymddygiad yw bod y sgriw yn dda iawn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036835_0037111 But this is a lot of this job is for this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038021_0038352 No, it's not, it's not, it's not. It's not the top priority.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038566_0038773 I think it'd look better on wind eyes as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038773_0039024 oherwydd y mae Jawa'n defnyddio'r Windows natyf.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0039343_0039428 Actually, can we?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0040098_0040140 to the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0041480_0041897 Well the um, the um, speaker characterisation is finished.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042029_0042437 Nid oes gen i gyd yn cael gwybodaethau'r obiectau hynny oherwydd mae'n mynd i'r agweddau ar y cyfans.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042437_0042884 Mae'n ffastr oherwydd unrhyw rhan os ydw i'n log in ymlaen ac yna'n gweithio'r codi.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042884_0043116 Mae'n mynd yn fwy fwyaf oherwydd yna, yn y ffordd yma.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043276_0043666 It does. I just can't help but sit in the lab and wait.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043889_0044535 I've done stuff like that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0044535_0044929 really speed it up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045839_0045916 That's the way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045916_0046646 Mae'n dweud beth yw'r cyfleoedd yn y cyfleoedd, a gallwch chi weld beth yw'r bwynt.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0046646_0046715 I'm sorry about that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047380_0047894 Mae'r diologau yn cael ei wneud ac mae'r cyfnodau yma yn ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047894_0048815 But some of them, some of the things, actually what I wanted to talk about in that little bit was there are some that occur all the time that I just, and I don't know how interesting there are.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0048815_0049448 So the first one statement is that it will be removed because it was like everything is prefixed by statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0049448_0050088 every single dialogue act starts with statement and so everybody's top dialogue act statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050088_0050129 So we're good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050245_0050314 So I'll go into that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050314_0050682 and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050682_0050792 I don't know what that means.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050792_0050952 who knows what was it? Back Channel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051210_0051277 Is that what that means?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051277_0051370 Oh, keep going.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051370_0051605 And then the other.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051884_0051947 Some people don't though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051947_0052095 There are some people who don't do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052095_0052411 actually yeah you can see that they don't do that and it's the bottom of their list
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052523_0052876 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052876_0053288 Some people have, and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time, yes no questions.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0053288_0053572 So which
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054120_0054797 That's the thing I wanted to know whether or not we because at the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five or the top X
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054797_0055107 So you give it any number, it will give you the top whatever for each person.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0055107_0056001 a yna'r ystod y cyfnod yn gwybod am yr holl ddialogau arall ar gyfer y cyfnod. A yna'r amser y byddai hynny'n cael ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056001_0056677 and we'll give you that in top order as well or you can just search for each specific dialogue act.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056677_0057267 Mae angen i chi ddysgu yn Bs a Ks yn ymwneud â ddwy ffordd rhan o'r ddwy ffordd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057267_0057447 I can change that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057447_0057616 So I don't know what we want to display
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057616_0057967 That's why I'm asking you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0058705_0058934 All's like 25.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0059098_0059276 I mean do we care?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061270_0061732 Rwy'n credu y byddwn yn cael y 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o'r 5 o
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061732_0062279 Felly roedd un o'r box wedi'i ddysgu, dyma fy nghymdeithas 5 diogelwch. I'r ddweudwr.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0062279_0062926 And then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speakers top dialects.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063063_0063146 Either of those would do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063146_0063342 but it would start to think about the space.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063541_0063654 Well you could have, no you don't need that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063654_0063991 Because it's a speaker window, the speaker characterisation window comes up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063991_0064404 Felly mae gennych chi'r un ymlaen yno ac yna gallwch chi ddod o'r 5 o'r cyfle yn y cyfle hwn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0064404_0064962 A yna'r 5 o'r cyfle yn y cyfle yng Nghymru, a'r 5 o'r cyfle hwnnw, ac yna'r rhai yw'n bwysig.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066048_0066086 that can.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066256_0066714 Ond yn ddiweddar y pethau'n ddaeth yn ddaeth, pethau fel llwyth yn ddaeth yn ddaeth yn ddaeth llawer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066714_0067023 Well they do sometimes but they're not that common.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067023_0067170 One guy has top five chugging.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067170_0067229 one of his tokens.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067229_0067328 He's an undergrad.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067328_0067396 That's what I'm doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067426_0068442 This is good for browsing though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0068558_0068633 That's what's good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069233_0069679 Thank you, me. Yeah. It's taking till next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069860_0070409 That would be quite good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0072044_0072846 beth yw'r cyfleoedd diologau y mae'n ei wneud yn y cyfleoedd a'r cyfleoedd yng nghymru a'r ymgysylltu?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073056_0073347 I think most things are coded with the dialog act
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073347_0073526 A lot of them are kind of with a Z, which means no labels.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073526_0073733 Felly roeddwn i'n meddwl y byddwn i'n mynd i'r ddau.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073733_0073790 accessible.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073946_0074059 a'r ystafell y mae'n anodd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074059_0074781 And also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something, so if I quote a joke to you, they separate that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074781_0075165 So they put the dialogue act and they put a double the colon and they put that aside
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075165_0075639 Ond roeddwn i wedi gwneud unrhyw materiaethau cyfrifol oherwydd yw'r pethau'n ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075639_0075772 Ya, ada orang lain yang menjelaskan.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075772_0076025 So you have to be original about your material.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0076025_0076404 Oh, that's a bad credit, too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077423_0077500 Yes, we got it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077500_0077559 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077673_0078155 Mae'n rhaid i mi ddod yn ymwneud. Mae'n rhaid i mi ddod yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078155_0078195 Ich habe es mir schon mal gemacht.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078195_0078339 But I think it's pretty much complete.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078339_0078429 So I'll do that tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078429_0078493 just put it up there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078493_0078683 gallwch ddechrau'r ddau.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0080941_0081261 Nid, mae'n dda i ddod yn ddod yn ddod.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081261_0081362 괜찮지, 이거
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081863_0082071 Put it in a package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082181_0082258 Ich bin überwältigt.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082410_0082679 It doesn't seem to make any difference. I've never ever used driving packages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082679_0082941 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082941_0083101 I think it's in the same directory it works.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0083101_0083343 So diolch.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0084289_0084638 Yr hyn y gallwch ddod o'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085342_0085510 Yeah, we have something, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085510_0085735 Just for a little Microsoft gift like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087174_0087240 You have it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087458_0087887 What am I seeing out before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0089751_0089873 I'm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0090954_0091434 What do you think I'm gonna do? MSC is an information machine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0091434_0092082 Mae'n dda iawn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093351_0093450 It's really easy
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093450_0094076 you do it in one of the whatever the main window is you do set gear for some set set set picture
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094076_0094130 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094723_0094995 Rwy'n credu y byddwch chi'n ei wneud yn ffarn, yn oes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095198_0095345 Yeah, yeah, just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095345_0095469 C'est sûr.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0096862_0097042 You can even have some sound when it comes on in
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097042_0097588 Welcome to the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097588_0097750 No, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097750_0097841 I have to do it anyway.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0098317_0098701 No. No. But I think if you put headphones in it'll just play it just normally.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0099842_0099951 Sometimes it works.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0106575_0107074 I still can't make it run TNT from Java. Maybe I'll try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107074_0107140 Yeah, you try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107140_0107443 Mae'n dda i'n gwneud y gwaith.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0108805_0109267 It's a job of course. Practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0109598_0109694 Cool as hell.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0110835_0110927 Yeah, I think it was.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111060_0111155 Se fue atrás.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111299_0112231 It was plainly generated by going to generate a Java doc and it just went...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112554_0112756 It's good to know what methods are there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112756_0112904 without having to look at the source code.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112904_0112944 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0113268_0113370 This is the zero.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114442_0114592 Today, wasn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114592_0114681 I thought we saw
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124630_0124769 We didn't have the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124769_0124899 Maybe it's just today, too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125011_0125070 Send them an email.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125070_0125180 I probably wouldn't do it anymore.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126155_0126235 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126563_0126708 He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0132751_0132990 How many people have you tried?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133265_0133358 Really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133528_0133914 No, it would take forever and then you gotta analyze the results.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133914_0134088 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0135705_0136941 Yeah, one computer scientist, one art student, and one dude off the street. And one supposed to be a woman, one supposed to be a man, and one... visible woman.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0137100_0137490 I should just have two.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139417_0139544 Always true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139544_0139677 Yeah, in two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140616_0140712 So that's the whole handle.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140712_0140962 25th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141119_0141248 24th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141940_0142114 Yeah, yeah, it's been fun. Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145149_0145491 We should try and have it done by then anyway.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145491_0145868 otherwise it starts getting tight otherwise
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146247_0146629 We should aim to be finished by Monday, this Monday coming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146629_0146885 Yr hyn yn dda, yn ogystal â'r ddwylo.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146885_0147214 start the evaluation pretty much straight away and then go.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147364_0147545 Yeah, and then get...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147696_0147872 Mae'n rhaid i ni ddweud y reportaeth a phryd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147872_0147950 It's funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150022_0150518 That's easy compared to me. I mean, I'm not even really...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150813_0151225 and you must have your research for power.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151225_0151432 Yr hyn yn y 18?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151652_0152009 How's yours? I know, not at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199496_0199655 the US dog
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199655_0200097 Mae'n dda i'n ei wneud. Mae'n dda i'n ei wneud. Mae angen i chi ddod o'r bwydau ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0200097_0200142 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0204919_0205171 Mae'n gallu gwneud y gwaith ymchwil am y gwaith.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205569_0205767 Is that what I mean?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205965_0206035 É.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206073_0206264 Yeah, I did the above with that, but yeah, cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206264_0206444 What? I didn't think we were going to bother with that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206444_0206625 Well, we can't do anything about that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206625_0206726 Yeah, it does.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0207919_0208441 Well, we'll do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it. But we're not going to do it. At the very least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209642_0209821 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209821_0209934 I don't know how to do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209934_0210340 Er enghraifft, os yw'n gallu gwneud rhai cyfnodau.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210340_0210705 Dwi ddim yn credu ein bod yn gallu ei ddweud y byddwch chi'n mynd i weithio gyda'r sefydliad.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210877_0210998 If you're creating it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210998_0211183 They like taste. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211183_0211507 Ja, er war keine leichte Mahlphase, weil er war mit dem normalen Dir.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211507_0211992 Roeddwn i wedi cael ymddygiad am ddod o gyrraedd XML.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211992_0212200 En dit ligt achter de mensen die...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212200_0212531 I swear it's not as straightforward as writing an XML fuzz.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212531_0212781 but it's organizing the segment later.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212781_0213044 It just looks so complicated to get it from.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0213203_0214288 o'r ffyrdd dechrau mewn i'w gweithio yn ymwneud â phynhaid sy'n mynd i'r ddarlith a'i gweithio. Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n ddiddordebol, oherwydd y peth y gallai eu gwneud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214288_0214589 Organise it by time, not by speed.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214589_0214771 Bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214959_0215201 절대 안 해
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218105_0218169 Yeah, we did.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218169_0218366 Mae angen unrhyw fath o ddwy o bryd hwn.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0004201_0004336 It's the next day.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0007493_0007587 It seems slippery.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0009133_0009200 Bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011344_0011435 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011435_0011518 Is that an essay?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011518_0011696 No, that's just summary.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011754_0011982 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012309_0012442 Oh, right this way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012641_0012696 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012988_0013625 I didn't have privileges to get in to update your file.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0013625_0014060 I actually meant to send the email and then just continue.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014324_0014843 check the read-write in the line-up. Because I forget mine as well and it's just like you know every time I put something in there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014843_0015002 See you guys.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015002_0015254 That was the main thing, so as soon as that's in, it'll be ready.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015254_0015416 I was making a couple of little changes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015416_0015672 so those will be able to play with.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015672_0016188 Still working on the, trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016188_0016478 So that's that's where tonight
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016478_0016680 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016680_0016966 Come on.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016966_0017340 getting a better feel for all these night objects.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017545_0017761 It's just a funny game. Seems a little chaos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017761_0018272 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018272_0018612 and you spend the time to invest and learn all about them. It's like, wow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018612_0018924 What's the minimum I can get away with? Get me what we need.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018924_0019419 So it's like, I don't know, unless I want to do something with this in the future.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019590_0019753 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019753_0020065 Dear.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020065_0020117 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아, 아,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020297 Anyway, so, yeah, that's about it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020934_0020962 I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021106_0021208 I think I got...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021208_0021506 I saw that and I'm just trying to remember it. I did create it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021506_0022321 Because I was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago. So that may be mine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022549_0022601 Oh really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022863_0022940 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022940_0023032 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023032_0023273 Yeah, so it's hard to get into that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023273_0023456 Yeah, I hope so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023456_0023857 Um, but yeah, that was, that was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024270_0024714 I'm just giving false impressions of what's happening. Something's going on.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024880_0025008 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025008_0025238 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025238_0025333 I'll follow his objects.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026232_0026377 I'll just record on that one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026377_0026667 What did I actually do on my twit out?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026667_0026774 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026774_0026982 So we probably won't have to worry about it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0027676_0027902 そうですね。
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028023_0028142 Mm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028142_0028236 How's everything else going?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0029902_0029991 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030189_0030281 Do we want to keep that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030281_0030441 Like, are we keeping that how that happens?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030441_0031056 it just prints everything out in the shell as well, because it does everything. I guess that's its default behavior.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031056_0031237 So that's just cool. It doesn't really do anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031237_0031329 So you can.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0032007_0032077 Oh, right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0034811_0035151 I was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what I was doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035151_0035394 So I didn't take it for a full test run yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035394_0035525 but you can do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035525_0035715 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0036863_0037115 This is the most difficult job I've ever done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038183_0038603 I think it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038603_0038718 They look better on wind eyes as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038718_0038753 谢谢老师
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038753_0038799 Donc, c'est...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0039372_0039778 Actually, can we run it on Windows?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040120_0040237 Is it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040589_0040879 Were you using like a GUI builder or just all from the phone?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040968_0041094 Okay, let's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041310_0041492 That's nice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041892_0041987 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043448_0043867 Can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043867_0043909 Hey
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043909_0044253 I don't know. I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0044253_0044625 I've done stuff like that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0050822_0050856 always
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0051559_0051733 It's kind of boring.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0054913_0054979 forever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057759_0057819 I'm asking
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057819_0058348 or if we have a choice so they can filter those out, the top most common.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0058348_0058783 just say okay show all or show only all the law
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059359_0059504 I don't know, that doesn't really matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059504_0059733 We can just automatically filter these out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0061216_0061303 I think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067906_0067986 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067986_0068106 This is good for browsing though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068106_0068152 That's funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068152_0068407 I mean, that's... It's like it was one idea.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068407_0068548 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068837_0068890 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0069493_0069749 It's taking to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075358_0075462 Let's do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075513_0075642 It was a marvellous joke anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077116_0077494 Okay, that sounds right. So that's sort of implemented now or is that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077764_0077829 Yeah, I just have to...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0078649_0079199 When I'm done typing, I'll just recompile the end browsers and then just get that. You will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079280_0079699 So it uses my private as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0080103 Actually, do we have a naming convention for source files?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080103_0080384 Just prefix them with an N. Yeah, I was thinking
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080690_0080798 That's sort of what I was doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080798_0081025 Like for your stuff do you have?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081163_0081249 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081369_0081562 It doesn't matter at this point.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081562_0081701 Nah, just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081701_0081885 Oh, I'm thinking about the future stuff maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082092_0082165 Yeah, that's true too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082282_0082406 Yeah, yeah, doesn't matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082770_0082939 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0084966_0085049 you know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0085720_0085881 No
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086848_0086949 Yeah, I know, yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086949_0086988 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0087619_0087884 I don't think I've ever seen that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088088_0088254 Super size meeting browser.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088254_0088280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088280_0088700 You
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089258_0089791 Just probably basic text font and just something nice, something solid maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089791_0089834 Okay, good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090132_0090202 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090375_0090402 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090402_0090808 Anybody have any artistic talent?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091249_0091487 It's possible something pulls out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091487_0091840 Some people. Some people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091917_0092258 Maybe I'll check to see if I can find anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0092806_0093153 How do you add that to the Java program?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093153_0093342 Mae'n dda i'n meddwl.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093342_0093493 It's really easy you do it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094287_0094388 Put it there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094440_0094501 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094688_0094729 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095016_0095251 Also, it'll do the automatic scrunching down.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095251_0095320 ...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0096153_0096712 Yes. It's a distinct distinctive experience.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097105_0097311 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097451_0097610 Can we get sound on these machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097654_0098357 Have you ever managed to play any sort of music on the dice machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098357_0098436 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098676_0098758 I'm ready for any time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098758_0098971 If
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0099427_0099484 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100612_0100744 We need a lot of audio.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100972_0101247 Okay, well this looks good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103314_0103778 and we're going to be trying to get the output from that. I don't know, still haven't found out if it's sound.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103900_0104113 feasible to open up more than one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104113_0104744 as many NOM objects as we can for each meeting to do. Like we were going to figure that the ranking did make sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104744_0105104 like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105104_0105252 So we are going to look through only five of them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105252_0105882 just pick the top five to do the search. And since that's probably what we're looking for anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106821_0106975 Seriously?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106975_0107255 Maybe I'll try. Yeah, you try. Maybe you make it work.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0107377_0107864 Ja, dat is wel een zwaar. Ja, dat zou me verleiden omdat ik dat niet kan.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0108383_0108461 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109005_0109126 Yeah, this is just like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109126_0109300 practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109808_0110031 How do you guys find the documentation for Next to You?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110161_0110304 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110304_0110440 Smile.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112103_0112218 Yeah, come here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112218_0112577 Well, it's still this research platform.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112911_0113066 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113122_0113211 I'm just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113883_0114458 Did we have a date for when we actually want the system done?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0114458_0115163 It was a nice night, wasn't it? I think we should change it to Friday. Yeah, I think we should change it to the 10th or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115163_0115809 Because the thing is, I mean, we can keep working on little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115809_0115932 to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0116104_0116933 So I don't do we want to set an actual hard deadline for like when exactly were we going to start the evaluation?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117358_0117427 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117427_0117920 We can still come up with test cases for the people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117920_0118139 come up with scenarios. That sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118139_0118504 I mean, that's fairly straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118504_0118703 I'm sure we could do that in a meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118703_0118805 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118805_0119034 Just brainstorm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120063_0120141 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120773_0120899 to work on it as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121052_0121445 I've got my DNLG presentation on Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121445_0121759 Too much now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0122268_0122340 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123133_0123383 Well, probably if they talk to Steve at some point in time, I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123383_0123515 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123676_0123949 We'll probably just have a regular Tuesday meeting with him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123949_0124267 Like we could send him an email but I don't know if he's around.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124267_0124755 Is that around this week? I think that's why we didn't have the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124939_0125003 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125180_0125261 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125261_0125430 Although do we really want the answer?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125430_0125786 So if you don't ask, we can push it off.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127258_0127312 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127630_0127793 Right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127793_0127917 I'm looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129036_0129224 Yeah, if they have time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129224_0129346 I'm just trying to find people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129674_0129833 Yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130060_0130210 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130210_0130370 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130898_0131310 Actually, some of my friends in different programs might be more willing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131310_0131482 Have more of a break.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131482_0131772 So then I get a range of types of people as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131772_0132330 Like not highly computer-like, not let it slither it to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132330_0132565 That might be good as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132565_0132750 Set a wider range of people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132950_0133165 I'm just thinking like three or four maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133165_0133775 That would be good. Really? I was thinking of like 10. No, take forever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133872_0133975 Zor, zor.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133975_0134636 Like, did an HCI course a while ago and it says, that's what they, there's three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134718_0134790 That was fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134790_0135144 then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135305_0135407 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135407_0135572 Mae'n dda.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135862_0136947 One art student and one dude off the street. One supposed to be a woman and one... I don't know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137425_0137628 That's beautiful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137628_0137769 Mm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137769_0137988 But yeah, if he finds them then that's cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137988_0138094 which it finds people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138094_0138215 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138516_0138578 Oh, right here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0139203_0139271 in two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140242_0140610 I thought evaluation maybe for the report.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140610_0140752 So that's the full handle.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140752_0140882 I like it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140882_0140970 I thought that was it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140970_0141080 That's what I understand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141247_0141500 I thought you said 23rd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141500_0141952 Even though it's Good Friday. It's not Good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142066_0142163 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142163_0142403 Easter too. Wow, that's not a good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142418_0142656 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142656_0143082 Rwy'n siwr yw'r wefan yw'r ystyr.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143247_0143567 So that gives us two days to do the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143567_0143766 No, you don't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143766_0143830 You know, the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144144_0144408 I didn't think so, necessarily.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144408_0144537 I wouldn't assume.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144537_0144643 But we should ask them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145641_0145965 Yeah, that's probably tight otherwise. It's a good target.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145965_0146120 Yeah, you might.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147092_0147205 Straight away and then get...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147902_0148058 It's funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148058_0148276 It's just funny that you haven't finished my Monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148276_0148594 Because after Monday, I'm pretty much free for about a week or so. Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148594_0149073 It's like, if we hadn't, you know, a bit more time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149456_0149558 Follow the next one. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149558_0149960 Yeah, I'm free after this Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149960_0150359 That's easy compared to...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150359_0150594 I mean, I'm not even worried about it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150724_0150827 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150827_0150890 今さえ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151378_0151464 You didn't know that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151464_0151692 I'm gonna go.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151692_0151764 How's yours?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151929_0152096 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0152773_0153143 Maybe that was us, then not him. Yeah, that's why I'm trying to...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153143_0153293 All right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153647_0153757 Yeah, Thursday 24th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154007_0154164 deadline for submission of the plan.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154502_0154676 Well now you can End of lectures
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155209_0155380 So, it's important for us to...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155884_0156315 Just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156649_0156753 We should have it done anyway.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156753_0156839 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157128_0157274 But it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157274_0157747 Is that a part of the demonstration?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0159586_0159628 Oh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160781_0160938 A few little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160938_0161185 Just make some comments at the last meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161185_0161535 Just generally how it all integrates, blah blah blah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161535_0161657 Do we know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161997_0162216 I'd expect somewhere 10 to 15 pages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162406_0162725 Although it's 50% of the mark, I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162725_0162768 Mm-hmm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163174_0163343 Well, we have a bit of time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163473_0163524 That'll be good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0164978_0165201 Just to fine tune in their details.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165315_0165359 more.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165717_0166013 Yeah, that could be. That could easily be like five or six pages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169046_0169143 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169143_0169262 Nid oes bach.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169501_0169604 Although just to get it out of the way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169604_0169952 So I'm trying to remember to do that tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0171732_0172201 Just basic, pretty much like the interim. Do you want to, do you have the interim stuff?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0172201_0172565 Just sort of like Google type thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0173517_0173764 And as these come up, they'll just pop over there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174233_0174429 It doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174429_0174744 That's the other big part.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174744_0175073 I mean, how to get that communication between the two different kinds of windows.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175461_0175946 because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175946_0176441 That was why I was sort of deciding to get the three pains in there instead of just the one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0176699_0177347 So there's a couple of those little things there. There's the icon by the way. Yeah, I do. It's beautiful though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0177347_0177529 Yeah, and makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178574_0178779 Is that how it works in the other ones?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178779_0179183 in like the other windows like various like yeah different the topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0179927_0180420 If you have like a particular window that you want me to mimic its behavior
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180420_0180825 then just find it in the program and just say, okay, just how this one does it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180825_0181051 So if it's like the topic window or whatever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0181663_0182241 So I can just sort of trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring them into you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0187581_0187863 So one left click just highlights.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188300_0188413 I'll just let him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188570_0188695 the transcript or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0189392_0189561 You can just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0190694_0190785 That should be possible.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191221_0191242 time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191550_0191944 Although, yeah, this will, this is actually different from how we printed up here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191944_0192057 like if we're doing global search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192057_0192623 then we are going to do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192623_0192899 and then we'll either multi-select or, you know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192899_0193337 choose the one we want to actually do this. I think multi-select would make more sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193337_0193727 Well, just if there's like three of the top meetings like we said before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193727_0194086 language. We're looking for the little word language and get the highest rated ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194086_0194615 actually look for the terms we're not loading it on fall 76
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194615_0195308 So the results from that will narrow down what we're going to use for the local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195308_0195571 And we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195571_0195821 Are you preaching? Oh, I see what you mean, yeah. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195821_0196372 So it will be a bit different from how that is right now. When we do the research, at least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197254_0197407 Yes. If not, you can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197407_0197508 Good time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0201665_0201959 So that we search two different...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0202422_0202634 Let's actually start up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203017_0203143 Yeah, local anyways, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203143_0203227 No, that's easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203227_0203393 Yn ogystal â hynny?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203393_0203597 That's quite strong.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206489_0206636 Well, it kind of makes sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206636_0206734 Evet, az önce.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206901_0207310 Are we bothering with our topic stuff?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207310_0207511 Or is that sort of like our own topic segment?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207511_0207760 like since we can't do the labeling and all the rest.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207760_0207915 We are still doing our topic segment.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207915_0208053 Well, we'll set it in the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0208316_0209096 But we're not going to be doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they don't have labels.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209233_0209491 All the label ones?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209491_0209673 You're not for people to use.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209673_0209740 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210577_0210642 Here's the clip.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210642_0210701 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210701_0210871 Oh no, it would be country four.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210871_0211092 If you're creating it, it's all false.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218435_0218498 Probably not.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218498_0218791 I mean, just get work done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218791_0218984 I think that's what I've got to do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001099_0001453 Are we? We're not allowed to get in the light so...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001887_0002029 question
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002237_0002381 Am I supposed to be standing up today?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002986_0003229 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008190_0008382 Helo, bob un.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008382_0009196 I'm Sarah, the project manager and this is our first meeting, surprisingly enough.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009196_0009474 Okay, this is our agenda.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009568_0010193 We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better, feel more comfortable with each other.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010193_0010814 Then we'll go do teal training, talk about the project plan.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010814_0011589 discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got 25 minutes to do that as far as I can understand.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0011762_0012154 Now we're developing a remote control, which you probably already know.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012154_0012699 Rwy'n mynd i'r bwyd yn unig, rywbeth y bydd pobl ddim'n meddwl o.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012699_0013201 it's not out in the shops. Trendy, appealing to a wide market.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0013201_0014283 but you know not a hunk of metal and user friendly grannies to kids maybe even kids should be able to use it
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014283_0014958 Okay, first is the functional design. This is where we all go off and do our individual work.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014958_0015940 beth sydd angen i'w bod yn cael ei ffurfio o'r product, beth sydd angen i'r product, a sut mae'n mynd i'w wneud hynny.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0015940_0016094 Cynhwyswyr cyntaf.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0016231_0016780 beth rydym yn meddwl, sut y byddai'n mynd i'w ddod, a yna'r deilio'r ddysgu, sut y byddwn yn ei wneud yn ymwneud â'r gweithdoriaeth a'i wneud yn gweithio.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017038_0017203 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017203_0018410 We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard. I'll go first. And show us the characteristics of that animal.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0018883_0019207 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0021146_0021197 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024322_0024433 Ready, and play.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024789_0025060 I'm not going to ask you to guess, I'm going to tell you about Swiss Re-tiger.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025453_0025724 and I see that as majestic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025989_0026225 and independence.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0027231_0027542 No, who would like to go next?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028757_0028966 .
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028966_0029010 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0035001_0035109 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0037384_0037686 Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039399_0039492 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039631_0039980 It was in the past.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0042011_0042095 That's lovely.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0043985_0044177 Good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0046109_0046216 Technical help.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0048966_0049134 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0050119_0050466 Seagull. Right, not a seagull.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0055448_0055515 So
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056312_0056546 That was fun.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056546_0057464 Finance wise we've got a selling price at 25 euros which I don't actually know what that is in pounds at all.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0057464_0057532 Any ideas?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058385_0058512 yeah that's
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058638_0058798 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0059098_0059592 I think so. I think so. I'd be able to pull it up or I could put it in shared folders. Having said that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0060813_0060929 Mae'n dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061351_0061782 Yn ystod y cyfleoedd ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mhob ym mh
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061913_0062426 half of the selling price is taken up by building it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0062426_0062944 and profit aim is 15 million euros which is
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0063129_0063642 Thank you. Yes. Um, yeah. I presume so.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0064913_0065029 Everyone, music.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0065357_0066222 Mae'n grwp hwyl. Rwy'n credu y byddwn yn gweithio am ddiforol ddynion a phethau fel hyn.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0066222_0066970 making that key point just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067520_0067829 What are your experiences with remote controls?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067829_0068347 I mean, I've got, we got, we had three videos.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0068347_0069167 a TV and a sort of amp thing all set up. So we got one of the universal remote controls.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069167_0069939 a'r hyn sydd yn cyfrannu'r pethau i'w gyrraedd, ond roedd y cyfrannu'r cyfrannu'n bwysig, felly byddwn yn rhaid i ni gyrraedd ymlaen i'w gyrraedd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069939_0070270 Rwy'n credu bod e'n ddiddordeb hefyd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070270_0070483 Ond roedd hynny'n bwysig iawn y gallwch chi...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070596_0070891 You didn't have six remote controllers sitting in front of you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073498_0073730 Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073730_0075176 I mean, and you don't want to, I hate, I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0075743_0077073 when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions when you can do sound or options, kind of recording.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077073_0077283 things like that inside it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077283_0077979 because it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at. It's obvious what you're doing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081235_0081365 What about the older generation?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081365_0081509 What about granny and granddad's?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081615_0082363 My grandad can answer his mobile phone but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0082812_0083151 I don't think they tape things.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0084120_0084324 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0086430_0087174 I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that have got a Windows based running system.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087295_0087683 I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the first part.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087683_0088287 I've not got a new one but my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting masks.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0088438_0088517 That's just me.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0090577_0090750 I'll just say it's safe.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091369_0091737 I'm bored by kind of a dual function.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091737_0092964 in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, program things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0092964_0093488 obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0094848_0095316 I think that's a cost thing. You don't know how much we're going to know about it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0095602_0095807 Yes, it has a point.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0097097_0097935 Yn ogystal â hynny, mae gennym 1.5 o hour am y cyfle nesaf, felly rydym yn mynd i'w gael a'n gwneud ein pethau'n unig.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0098120_0098951 I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and raise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102232_0102399 I would never probably
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102504_0102689 I mean, this guy remote controls and everything.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102689_0103258 and they're kind of moulded and look a bit different and the Tally West remote controls are silver plastic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103258_0103865 It looks a bit smarter.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103865_0104156 Okay, so let's break it up there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104313_0104416 So see you in half an hour.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104776_0104904 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002515_0002683 I think that's a decent one.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002912_0003048 Yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0003130_0003339 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0004975_0005318 It's a slide.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0030638_0030720 a kind of dope.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0035651_0036214 Felly, dwi'n mynd yn y ffaith yn y bwyto, yn y tŵr.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0037680_0037894 I think it's astoundingly good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0042144_0042234 And, uh...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0044316_0044795 Rwy'n bwysig iawn i chi'n gwybod ymddygiadau'r ddau.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0044795_0045085 Is that coming in?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0045400_0045694 I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0045797_0046057 I do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0046538_0046851 Cymysgwch ar y ddau allan, 200.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0046851_0047088 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0047441_0047935 Yn y ffordd, mae'n dda i'w ddod yn fy nghymru. Roeddwn i'n ei wneud yn y ffordd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0048126_0048468 It doesn't look like what I want it to be.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0048877_0049141 I don't know if I'm part of that on this show.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049290_0049778 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049778_0049996 My dread was the worst.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049996_0050809 Yn ogystal â'r ddau oedd yn seigol.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0050809_0051149 Dyna yw'r gwella, yn dda iawn, yn dda i'n mynd yn fy ffordd, oedd yn dda.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051149_0051612 So they're also independent of the bow and down again.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051612_0051866 Um.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052028_0052492 Yn ddwyloedd y gallai gael gaff?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052492_0052624 Ego.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052691_0052920 Alright, I'm not going to go.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052920_0053660 Mae'n dda iawn i'w ddod yn y ffordd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054142_0054715 ac yn fwy fwyaf, dyma'r ddau.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054715_0054953 I'm trying.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0055366_0055677 And we go.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058488_0058597 17 pounds.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058837_0058954 Dylunio'r angen i'w gwneud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058954_0059174 Rwy'n meddwl y byddwn yn gallu ddweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud y by
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0059174_0059228 I think so.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0060809_0061392 Mae'n bwysig y byddwn yn ymwneud â'r bryd a'i wneud ein product yn edrych yn ymwneud â'r pwynt?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063037_0063120 in our first year.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063810_0064823 You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups. We're not focusing on business markets.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0064823_0065111 Mae'n bwysig i bawb o'r pethau.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0065341_0065540 Big target group. Yes, yes.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071292_0071717 My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071717_0072244 nid yn gwneud unrhyw tampio gyda'r cyfrannu, yn ddefnyddio'r cyfrannu i fideo a phideoau a phobl.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072244_0072768 but basically on off volume up and down, channel 1 to that basic function.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072768_0073605 Dwi ddim yn mynd i'n mynd i'r ddwy oedd yna, felly mae'n rhaid i fod rhywbeth yn gysylltuol o unrhyw un, fel fi hefyd.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0075081_0075529 Mae'n dda iawn fod yn dda i chi ddod yn dda.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0076852_0076898 questions.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0077978_0078326 Mae hynny'n dweud y pwynt. Rwy'n meddwl beth yw'r ffordd y mae'n credu o'n bobl.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078326_0078704 Ond yw, yn y telefon mobl, gallwch chi gweithio'r llwybr ac mae'n rhoi menu.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078704_0079448 I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control like these, so you've got a little LCD display.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0080380_0080592 with menus.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0082379_0082797 A allai'n ei wneud ymdrech ymdrech ei ganddol? A oes yn eithaf'n dda?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083464_0083927 So that's the problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083927_0084464 Mae'n bwysig i'r pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd y pethau oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd oedd oedd y pethau oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd oedd o
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0089871_0090564 A'r bwysig yw, i'r dynol, gallwch chi gael button extra sy'n gweithio ar ddod o bwyd, fel y gwnaethoch yn bwyd o bwyd?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0090564_0091178 Mae'n dweud bod yna ddysgwyr ar y sgrin, ond fel y gallant eu gweld, dyna'r peth pwysig.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0093518_0094012 The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094012_0094353 You can have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094353_0094756 You can have a bigger screen in the flip-over.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095678_0095860 That's important.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095969_0096635 Ac nid oes unrhyw rhesymau i ni ddod o fod yn ffasionol a'n ffocwyr fel ffonau mobl, gallai ei fod yn plasgau llwybr plasig.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0096635_0096916 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddod oherwydd ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0096916_0097245 Dwi'n dweud, dwi'n dweud ymlaen i'ch ddwylo yn y tair os ydych chi'n gwybod.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0100506_0100574 So what?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0100916_0101130 Sure.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101370_0101720 Mae'n dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101720_0101945 Dyna'r pwynt mwyaf i ddweud ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101945_0102210 Dwi'n meddwl y bydd gwneud y plastic yn llwybr, ond roeddwn yn meddwl y bydd yn gwneud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0102210_0102441 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0104642_0104829 A allwn i'n mynd i'r ddau?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0031569_0031739 All right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035348_0035555 You're okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035911_0036174 아, 그렇죠.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0036174_0036765 Q. Since you guys have chosen the ones I want to stay with, I have to decide.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037143_0037529 And also my drawing skill isn't that great? Well as you can see across
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037960_0038448 Okay, now I'm going to change what it was originally. Because that looks like a beak.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039041_0039795 Crocodile?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039795_0040627 Firstly it was an attempt at T-Rex and then it sort of changed into a Pelican but it can be correct.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0042120_0042597 I'n meddwl y byddwn yn ystod o'r pethau y mae'n hynny.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0042812_0043022 scary
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0043248_0043437 strong
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0043874_0044199 Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0044523_0044668 Добрый день!
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0049740_0049998 My dread was the worst yet.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0050176_0050322 Right
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0051987_0052095 They're gonna go.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0052430_0052863 Yeah. Eagle. Oh, right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0057511_0057766 It's not.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0058085_0058757 yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0059419_0060321 Having said that though, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market at the moment, they're about £20 anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0060321_0060809 So yeah, we had fun.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0070110_0070188 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0070518_0070672 You saw the ones that didn't have
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0071124_0071332 yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0082937_0083405 Yeah, my granddad thought she was better than me at using teletext, so...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0084373_0084958 Mae'n dda i'n mynd i'w ddweud. Mae'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i'n dda i
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085098_0085279 why everything's doing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085279_0086194 menus on new phones now they've got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0086443_0086588 I don't know how.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0087018_0087069 Oh yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0088518_0089370 I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50 how much of an excellent screen you could get
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0089370_0089931 Mae'n bwysig i chi ddod o'r bwyd i unrhyw bwyd yn y LCD.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0097068_0097179 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0098880_0099666 Just a quick thing about what you were saying about the doesn't need to be fashionable
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0099666_0100524 So I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the we put the fashion into electronics.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0000037_0000176 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0006420_0006633 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008050_0008166 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008322_0008403 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0025591_0025625 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0027508_0027545 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028514_0028661 .
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028908_0029068 All right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029068_0029332 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029332_0029602 Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031347_0031914 It's actually sitting. So, it's sitting. It's not standing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031914_0032186 Okay, I see it as one thing, it's very supportive.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032413_0032773 It's your best friend in you. You can talk to a dog. It can be your best friend.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032773_0033136 it doesn't discriminate between you based on what you are.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0033136_0034096 Second is loyal and third thing is intuition.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0034096_0035106 Dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So basically these are the three unique features I think belong to it all. Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0035106_0035147 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0036433_0036784 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0050178_0050267 Right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057676_0057871 I'm going to turn off the mic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057871_0058150 1.4 year old would make a lot of money.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0061754_0061959 다
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0063639_0063710 Um...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0069149_0069222 and the
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0070861_0071104 You want to integrate everything into one line.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0075518_0075806 When there's
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0078708_0078774 How many?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079289_0079360 little
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079446_0080057 I was thinking of the same lines, instead of having too many buttons and making it complicated for the user.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080057_0080603 maybe have an LCD display or something like that, like a mobile with menus
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080603_0081203 And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse in NVIDIA also.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0081521_0081896 My granddad can answer his question.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0094604_0094666 Good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095091_0095738 You don't know how much we're going to know about it. It might save up a bit of space. Instead of looking bulky, it might look small.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095738_0095924 but it might have its cost implications.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0104805_0104838 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000818_0000982 Is that clear?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000982_0001080 That's great, that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003704_0003883 Alright.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003883_0003972 Action.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0005545_0005586 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0006681_0007420 Right, okay. This is our second meeting and I might be a bit out of place.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0007420_0007886 Right, our agenda for today... Do you want us to give you a second?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008127_0008353 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008593_0008870 I'll go over what we decided last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0009263_0009912 We decided upon a universal control, one handset for all 2B video.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0010181_0011216 that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0011216_0012023 We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, in our profession, in electronics, that kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0012023_0012947 Our budget would have to affect, try not to reflect our budget that we might
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013141_0013633 I have a bit of, oh, oh you can see. Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013633_0014340 dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014485_0014869 roeddwn i'n mynd i weld a chlatiad a ddod yn y castell.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014869_0015936 We discussed a flip open design, reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming, things like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016324_0016680 Three presentations I've got written here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016866_0017062 Should we hear from marketing first?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017503_0017732 No, that's fine. That's fine. Okay, yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017907_0017982 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019400_0019512 FN
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019596_0019726 function
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0033828_0033873 哇
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0052766_0053017 Thank you. Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053017_0053235 A oes gennych chi ddod o'r ffordd?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053591_0053854 Maybe we start...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0059477_0059630 function
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0061274_0061355 Okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077551_0077886 Rwy'n meddwl y byddwn yn gweithio am y ffordd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077886_0078435 Okay, so if anyone wants to write something down, I want to be at the end.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0078855_0079091 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0079260_0079339 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080268_0080336 Bye.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080959_0081103 We just did it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084130_0084197 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084490_0084543 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0103869_0104058 Right and
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0104172_0104485 We have new project requirements.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0105110_0106034 We're not going to be using teletext. The consumer is considered outdated with the internet now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106240_0106856 our control is only going to be for TV, it's not going to be combined control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106856_0107844 a'r hyn yn ymwneud â'r blynyddoedd a'i gwybod yn ymwneud â'r bwysig i ni, ond mae'n hefyd yn gwneud yn dda i'w ddifynu.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0108057_0109180 says for TV only so looks like it's just yeah I think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it but
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109419_0109550 I don't know what do you think?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109550_0109781 just that for TV only.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109781_0110213 I mean general TV controls do do video as well
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0110444_0110888 I mean you get combined TV and videos don't you?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0112245_0112700 Rwy'n credu ein bod yn cael ei ddechrau ac yn cymryd mewn gweithgareddau a'r gwaith.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0118844_0119020 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120074_0120646 We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120646_0121783 So I think when we can take a cheaper option, which still does the same kind of thing, because it is something, it needs to be the thing that you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0121865_0122367 used to find it needs to be something that you don't lose. You were saying whistling.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122367_0122886 maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122886_0123385 you go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123385_0123711 something like that but that sounds a lot cheaper to me.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123800_0124766 The third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0124766_0125253 So we want logo, we want
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125490_0125856 ffasionaol, ffysgol, rydw i'n meddwl, beth rydych chi'n mynd am ymwneud â'r ymwneud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125931_0126371 people paying more for it to look good
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0126492_0126781 We need to focus on that as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132038_0132750 What about you were talking about the buttons? The controls that are coming out now have kind of big
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132750_0133469 rubber buttons, not tiny little big rubber buttons. But what about, I mean, because we've got to make it original.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133620_0133736 What about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133869_0134201 You know with the touch screen computer
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0134432_0135394 so it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135518_0135840 Nid oes angen gwella, mae angen i chi ddod i'r ddod.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135840_0137075 Mae'n meddwl y bydd yna'n dechrau, yn meddwl, yn ymwneud â Chwp, yn meddwl, ymwneud â phobl ymgyrch, yn ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137206_0137531 but quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137531_0138564 easily labelled so that anyone can say, oh yeah, that's obvious what that's for, and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0140284_0140357 This physical
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0145256_0146158 I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146158_0146540 or they can make it bigger or they can change features slightly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146796_0147715 Mae'n mynd i fod yn y sefydliad, felly mae angen i ni ffocws ar un peth, a ddechrau bod yn fwy o gaelau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0151286_0151974 or speech recognition, which is extremely expensive. I think that's the only way that you can avoid
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0152084_0152177 I'n fwyaf o bryd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0154752_0155002 We are talking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155203_0155496 the type of company that we're working for as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155496_0156520 that they want it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically associate that with the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0156520_0157418 Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0157418_0157983 but I don't think we're focusing on that. I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0158124_0158361 o bwysicwyr o ddwyloedd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160471_0160942 Okay, so the remote control functions...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160942_0161612 We've got the TV, we've got the video.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0161750_0162392 Dwi ddim yn gallu gwybod beth mae'n cael y llwybr ymlaen o ddau programe.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0162580_0163755 We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that. I always found that really easy when I discovered it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0163884_0164486 because you've got your general record anyway so if there's a program on you want to put record on.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164486_0164979 that's fine but if you do want to tape something in two days time you're not sure if you're going to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164979_0165402 you put the number in and it's just a number. It's not a date, it's not time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0165402_0165877 It's not channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just number.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166423_0166641 You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166940_0167575 is after if you look in the newspaper or TV guide or any TV guide there's a five
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0167575_0169104 six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at 10 o'clock on the 17th things like that so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169104_0169455 And it has been around for quite a long time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169712_0170288 No it's not. I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0172221_0172299 Okay, so.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0179443_0180041 The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your TV's not doing it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0180125_0180592 taking your TV and your controller and saying, look, this is what I'm doing, it's not working, what should I do?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181366_0181542 I think so.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181827_0181972 Instruction manuals.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181972_0182307 But I mean, there's customer service.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0182307_0183125 There will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to. And that way there's no call out charge.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0183125_0183634 there's no extra person has to walk to a shop on the high street
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0184469_0185430 But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little variety and lots and lots of pages.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185430_0185816 It does, you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you search through it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185816_0186123 So that should be something to think about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186123_0186346 What other functions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186346_0186957 We need, I'm not sure if we need a design decision now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186957_0187714 Ond rydyn ni'n credu am… oherwydd mae gennych chi ddilemau am y bataill. Dyna beth rydw i'n credu am…
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0187714_0187922 What about phone batteries? What kind of batteries are they?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0188854_0189772 Mae'n mynd yn dda llawer o blynyddoedd. Ac os ydych chi'n gwybod, y peth y gallech chi ddod oedd ymlaen o ddodau gweithio.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0189772_0190169 you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or at night or something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190169_0190674 but it doesn't really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time once it's charged.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190674_0191003 something like that should reduce.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0191820_0192107 Yeah, it could be on that. Yeah, it could be on that as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0192773_0192946 Mae'n bwysig i'r ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193074_0193261 So the recharge will be here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193952_0194291 Yes, which is cheaper than the other one as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194291_0194770 the shape you've got trendy
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194770_0195498 I don't want a big box with lots of things. You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0195498_0196249 because then you have got the repetitive strain in general matter how much you try and make it simple.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0196609_0196676 KJ.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0197718_0197875 Okay, so we've got a flip screen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0201381_0201563 Cause it's kind of moving to your head anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0202640_0203026 Can you look into the company logo?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0203150_0204079 things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204079_0204130 I mean
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204322_0205260 For example, if it was a C or something like that, you could have it in a vague C shape that opens up kind of like a shell.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0205260_0205875 or something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0206040_0206644 obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that's there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0208341_0208598 Well, we need to think about how it is going to look different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212165_0212769 O'r gallwch chi wneud ffasheau gwahanol fel y gallwch chi gael gyda phobl ffosil.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212769_0213100 You could have different kind of casings.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0213100_0213867 So you could have psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0216498_0216776 Right, I think we have to round it up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0218236_0219067 That was in cutting down the number of functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0219067_0219618 Felly, yn ystod hynny, y gallai'n ei wneud yn ystod llawer o bethau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0220670_0221444 It kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221444_0221589 doing it could be
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221657_0222602 Yes, it could be an advertisement feature rather than design feature, you know, draw attention to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0222671_0223557 and also paid lip service in the instruction manual. Because it's very simple, so putting it down in words should be helpful.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0224964_0225675 We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0226198_0226844 ac rydym wedi'i siarad am y byddai'n allan neu rhywbeth, o fod yn cael eu llwythu.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227005_0227308 Lleidio'r gweithdoriaeth ar gyfer ei fod yn ymwysoeddol.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228085_0228384 I don't know if we deal with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228594_0228670 I think.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228984_0229266 Ie, a'n fwyaf o'r hyn sydd i'n ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0229266_0229414 Yep, I think that's us.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230012_0230375 I think you might get guidance but...

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233087_0233150 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233342_0233739 I think you can email me if there's any more questions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233929_0234196 I know I'll be able to not answer that.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0051715_0052358 That's a very important point, it came up in our market research findings too, so I can refer to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060486_0060728 The blood hasn't come out yet.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084563_0085725 I'm i weld y gysylltiadau'n gweithio ar gyfer ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd. Mae'r cyfleoedd sy'n cymryd ar gyfer ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd yw'r ymwneud â'r ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0085725_0086149 Dyna lle y byddem yn ymwneud, roeddwn ni wedi defnyddio'r lab ddeall-us.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087633_0088097 Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088097_0088814 Mae'r peth yma yw bod y gwasanaethau'n ddifynu'r edrych a'r ffeill o'r cyngor ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088814_0089076 so it has obvious design implications there.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100548_0101364 ond rydym yn meddwl amdano yw, efallai bod y gysylltiad ymchwil yn gallu dod o blif bob amser a angen pan fyddwn yn cael ei ddod neu'n mynd i'r llwyth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101496_0101820 Mae'r amlwg yn y grwpau oedol.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102724_0103167 I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you but I think I'll just keep

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0107683_0108058 Felly, gallwn ni ddod yn ffrwyd y fideo gyda'r cyngor ymlaen?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0108448_0108535 is just

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114281_0114818 Rwy'n credu bod yna'r bwysig ymddygiad ymgyrch ymgyrch ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114818_0115453 a'r hyn yn ymwneud â gwybodaethau cyfrannol y gall pobl sy'n cael eu hysgyrchio'i fideo fel nifer.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0116582_0117240 I just called up that table there. We asked those two questions. The table relates to both questions so we didn't differentiate.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0147756_0148224 I'm concerned when you raise the RSI issue again, repetitive strain injury.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148581_0148982 I think that is still a kind of question mark issue, how we deal with that.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153020_0153426 ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153426_0153757 A allwn ni'n rhaid i fynd i bob un yn y ddau?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0154265_0154787 Mae'n bwysig i ni ddod o'r ideaethau, mae'n bwysig i ni ddod o bobl bwysig, bobl bwysig, bobl bwysig.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158340_0158878 I'm just thinking of literature as use too for when it does get to the sort of broad-scale marketing stage.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158878_0159335 want to not waste money, not be profligate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159538_0159772 in a focus on where the idea will be taken up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159772_0160276 Mae'n bwysig i'w ddod yn ymwneud â pherfyd yng nghymru y gallai ymwneud â pherfyd yma.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0166569_0167039 I'm not coming across that function but it sounds wonderful.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0167960_0168027 And it's
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0171461_0171636 Excellent.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172320_0172808 Can I just run this past you while that occurs to me? I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172808_0173473 Ond roedd y cyfle o ddysgu'r grwpiau o ddiforol a'r cyfle o ddiforol a'r grwpiau o ddiforol sy'n cymryd i gyrraedd eu ffôn mobile.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0173473_0174307 That's kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with their design features. Chain companies like Carrefour Warehouse
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174307_0174740 gallwch chi ddod yn unrhyw amser gyda'r ffon sydd wedi'i gael i'w gael amdanoethau gyda'i gael ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174740_0175078 the company, you can use their telephones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175078_0175985 Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar service so that if older users were
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175985_0176511 If they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, you know, which button is it I press for this?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0176511_0176914 Mae hynny'n rhan o ddwyloedd, ond mae hynny'n ei wneud yn fwy o'r hyn yn ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180470_0180828 Dwi'n credu beth y byddwn i'n ei wneud. Os yw'n rhywbeth yn dda, gallwch chi ddangos y canol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180828_0181323 But I mean for if there were any more or we absolutely definite so they're gonna be for TV and video
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0181323_0181622 Rwy'n meddwl.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0184190_0184550 Felly, dwi'n meddwl y byddwn yn cymryd y ffyrdd yn ymwneud â hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185334_0185586 Mae'r bobl yn adael eu gweld.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185840_0186028 That should be something we think of.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196261_0196662 And we don't, I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical. They don't.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196662_0197058 brown things with the same coloured buttons all crowned in on the surface.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0197058_0197764 Mae'n rhaid i ni, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig, yn unig
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0200379_0200552 Banana chip
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0206780_0206923 that part.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0208703_0209017 I think that sounds a really attractive idea.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209017_0209569 Nid oes gennych o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hyn o'r
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209569_0209833 and it's nice to have, you can make it lightweight plastic.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209833_0210338 nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210338_0210880 Mae'n mynd i'r gwaith am ymddygiadau'r gwaith, ond roedd ymddygiadau'n ei wneud yn ymddygiadau'r gwaith.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210880_0211441 Mae'n dda iawn iawn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0211441_0212121 gallwch ddweud o'r adegau y gallwch ei wneud yn plasig, gallwch ei wneud yn llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o'r llawer o' ralla'
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213830_0213973 The next chance of it being lost too.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213973_0215162 nid fel un osod o choclwp brun sy'n mynd i'r sartre. Mae pobl yn mynd i ddod o'i gael ar eu gweithredu neu beth oherwydd os oes yn edrych yn oed yn lles, ac nid oes yn mynd i'w llwyddo.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0215162_0215553 It's easy to put, nice to handle.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0216798_0217196 A allwn ddod yn gyfle i'r cyfle newydd ymlaen i fod yn dda i ddim yn gwybod rhywbeth?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0217196_0218132 Felly nid oes teletext, mae'n unig i'r tebyg a'i fideo o ddifyniad. Mae'r fideo cyfrifiol yn dda i fod yn cyfrifiol yn eu gysylltu. Mae rhywbeth am fideo plus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219412_0219960 So when you press the program and it comes up on the LCD a reminder about using VideoPlus?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219960_0220091 i gyd yn edrych ar y gwaith.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0220232_0220665 neu a oes hynny nid oes i gyd â'r gweithredu proiect?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0221346_0221738 Felly mae'n gwneud y ffordd o'r ffyrdd o'r gynhyrch.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223519_0223739 And the rechargeable batteries.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223739_0224192 A oes yna unrhyw beth oherwydd y gallwn ei roi?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225709_0225935 Dyna ddim yn y cyfle rhan o'r gwaith, mae'n rhywbeth y byddem yn edrych ar hyn.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225935_0226310 Yn ogystal â'r cyfleoedd cyfrannol, mae'n rhaid i ni ddweud yw,
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229455_0229731 What would you specifically like marketing to look up for the next meeting?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229731_0230004 Or should I just generally look at only his teeth?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232273_0232423 Oops.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232530_0232698 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017650_0017791 Okay, yeah, okay, first.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017791_0017931 And then, grab the...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019155_0019224 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019224_0019332 So perfect.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019684_0019789 Mm.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0020998_0021062 .
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021250_0021849 This is the working design presented by me, the industrial design mixture of theirs.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021996_0022501 This is where I went with the map to a path on the other side.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022501_0022885 Yr un peth y byddwn yn ymwneud yw, a ydym yn ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud y
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022885_0023358 Mae'r adeilad sy'n cymryd y cyflog i'r TV i gydweud y cyfle.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023358_0023844 ymlaen, a'r canol a'r volum.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023844_0024692 Everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliances sending the signal to.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0024903_0025738 Felly roeddwn i'n dechrau i weld beth y bydd pobl eraill wedi'i deillio a allan i ddod o ffyrdd o hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0025738_0026006 Ond, er mwyn i ni ddod yn ystod
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0026148_0027208 o'r pethau o'r bobl, rydyn ni eisiau gwneud yn sicrhau bod ein diwydiant yn cymryd. Rydw i'n credu bod hynny'n rhywbeth y byddai'n dda i'n ei ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027266_0027489 I'm dealing with the inside really.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027489_0028055 Yeah, I ran out of time, so I'm going to do this one as fun as the last one.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0028055_0029482 Ac roeddwn i'n gwybod bod y mwyaf o'r cyngor yn defnyddio rhan o'r cyngor i'w gysylltu i'r TV, yn ymgysylltu oherwydd y cysylltu o beth fel y pethau sy'n gallu eu defnyddio
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029482_0029852 a dynnu'r cyfle i'r cyfle.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029852_0030249 Mae'r mwyaf o'r cyfle yn cael ei ddod o'r bactriaeth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030249_0030387 Now, all one...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030387_0032173 Dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n dweud a dwi'n
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032173_0032222 Yes, sure.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032558_0032617 No, no.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032617_0033253 Mae'r bethau'n bwysig, ac mae hynny'n bwysig oherwydd y bantreig.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033253_0033769 Mae'n rhaid i'w bod yn y gynllun hwn i'w gysylltu â'r banturau hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033769_0034754 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddod o'r cyllir rhan o'r ddod, ond rwy'n meddwl am gysylltu cyffredin a sut ydych chi'n treulio'r ddod.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0034754_0035461 a'r hyn sy'n mynd i'r pwynt nesaf am fod yn fwy fwyaf a'n dda i gael ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0035461_0036032 Yn ystod hynny'r unau yma yw'n bach ond roeddwn i'n meddwl os gallwn ni weld rhywbeth yn dda.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036119_0036880 Mae'r gweithredu sydd wedi'i gael ymlaen yn ymwneud â'r bantreidd, oherwydd yna ddim yn gallu gweithio.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036880_0037334 fel y dweud yma am y beth y byddwn yn dechrau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0037334_0039212 gallwch ymddygiad ymlaen ac yna rydych chi'n angen rhywbeth i ddechodeu'r wybodaeth y mae'ch gwella'n ymwneud o'r gwybodaeth a i wella'i mynd i'r cydnabod cyfrannol, a ydym yn mynd i ddefnyddio'r wybodaeth
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0039212_0040149 Mae'r cyfnodau hynny'n ymwneud â 5m, sy'n dda i chi sy'n gweld yn ffyrdd o'r ffyrdd o'r ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040149_0040724 ond nid yw'r rhai o bobl yn ei wneud, felly fel y gallwn ni'n ei wneud, mae'r mwyaf o bobl yn ei wneud, mae'n dda.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040724_0041786 and then I just had a quick look at the external design but I left that mostly to the interface designer
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0041918_0042276 Ac felly dyma'r bais i'w wneud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042276_0042828 It's not a proper circuit. I'm not sure if it will work or not.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042828_0043307 I'm not even confident that that's the real way you'd wire it on.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0043307_0044180 So we've just got the power going to the infrared bulb, the chip and the UI interface.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044335_0044440 which would basically
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044440_0045351 Pan oeddwch chi'n gweithio rhywbeth, mae'r cwp yn cyfrannu'n i mewn i ddau ffordd ymlaen, a allai'n gallu bod yn ddechrau o'r cyfrannu TV.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045351_0045881 which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045992_0047240 Mae'n ffordd o ddysgu y mae'r TV'n gweithio'n gweithio arall, ac oherwydd dyna unrhyw rhan i ddefnyddio infrared, oherwydd dyna beth y byddai'r TV'n gweithio ar hyn o bryd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047240_0047388 And then finally...

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0060745_0061098 Ich bin ein Halsscholz.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0078292_0078370 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0082660_0082831 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0083072_0083098 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0084009_0084398 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0109929_0110099 Charles yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110365_0110586 I did well, I did like this
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110905_0111510 os ydych chi wedi cael box sky, un o'r box sky plus
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0111510_0112232 gallwch recordio'r cyffredin o'r TV yn unig, fel y cyffredin ychwanegol y TV.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0115583_0116633 Mae'r benderfyniad yn dda iawn i'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ymwneud â'r gweithredu yn ym
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0116764_0116844 We'll
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0117659_0117763 more for speech training.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0118863_0120080 Ond yn y ffordd, dwi'n meddwl, oherwydd gallwch chi gael y cairau cyffredinol yma, a chweilio, a yna byddai'n gweithio o ddod o ddod i chi gyd yn gwybod lle mae'n. Felly rwy'n meddwl bod hynny'n gallu bod yn fwy.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0130630_0131204 Well yeah, you could have a number of different designs. I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0131327_0131716 The features could be same and the body could look slightly different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0134069_0134462 Yeah, yeah
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0135290_0135625 You don't have to press it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138496_0138917 Ond hefyd, ergonomiadau, fel y ddweud yw'r adroddiadau'n fwyaf.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138917_0140603 Mae'r bwysigau'n brydolol yn gwneud yn fwy o ffordd. Oherwydd os oes gennych chi'n gweld y XBOX, roedden nhw'n cael gwahanol gwahanol gwahanol gwybodaethau oherwydd bod pobl yn Jepai ddim yn mynd i'w brynu oherwydd bod y gwahanol yn ffysicol o'r gwahanol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0140693_0142376 Mae'r cyffredinau yn dda, yn y diwethaf, mae pobl Ieflenio'n gwybod, felly gallent gael gysylltu'r gysylltuad, a dyna, felly os ydych chi, dwi ddim yn gwybod beth, oherwydd y gallai chi gael bwyntiau bach yn y ddau neu rhywbeth, a gwybwyntiau bach ar gyfer yna.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0150192_0151305 Roeddwn i'n meddwl am sut gallwch chi gynnydd ymlaen. Oherwydd, yna, yna, yn gwneud rhywbeth y gallwch chi gweithio'ch arw ar ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0151424_0151723 Yeah, in the speech room. Which is extremely expensive.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0154022_0154151 जेफ़र पेटिन एचकुर्प
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0162240_0162351 Video Plus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0163198_0163315 Is that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0164781_0164911 in two days time and you're not sure.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165687_0165894 anything like that, it's just number.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165894_0166237 and you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0166237_0166555 Mae gennych chi'n gwybod y cyfle.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0167185_0167280 newspaper or TV.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0169347_0169912 It's been around for a long time, it's just not very well advertised. No it's not.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0170330_0171457 If you've got something like Sky anyway, you can just click on it. You can just press the button on the program once and it will record that program. When it's on, you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171608_0171863 So that, yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171863_0172203 but just have that function would be really good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0177063_0179451 Ond y pethau yw, gyda'r ffôn mabl, rydym wedi cyrraedd i'r cyntrach. Felly mae'r cyfans sydd yn ymwneud â chi wedi'i gweithio i helpu chi a hefyd. Mae'n ffyrdd i gael unrhyw gwasanaeth, ond dwi ddim yn siwr beth y byddai'r gwasanaeth yn ymwneud â hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181345_0181412 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181639_0182014 Yn ystyrwch, ystyrwch ychydig.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0182540_0182649 Very good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0184229_0184510 Mae'n fwyaf yn ymwneud â'r ffociwns yn ymwneud â hynny.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0185403_0185487 It does.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0187956_0188561 a'u ffordd yn ei wneud yn ymwneud â phobl ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0188561_0188987 But they come with a charger, I mean you could bundle a charger.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0190909_0191734 Mae'n dda iawn. Ie, os oes gennych un o'r hyn, roedd ymlaen i'ch rhan o'ch ddwylo a chweithio'r ddwylo a chweithio'r blwf yn y rhan.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0191928_0192056 Yeah, as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0192552_0192970 Mae'n rhan o ddechrau cyfrifol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0193338_0193963 Ie, ie, mae'n ffynig. A hefyd, mae'n rhaid i'w ddod yn ôl i'r bachau ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0053624_0053899 Maybe we start to...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059104_0059321 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059321_0059379 I see, right.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060255_0060416 Mm-hmm.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060673_0060814 Jetzt kann ich...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0061620_0062515 Actually some of my points might overlap with what William just mentioned. But basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0062515_0063547 this took up valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think will take a feedback from the marketing because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0063691_0064255 I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064255_0064919 So purpose as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make it as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064919_0065298 and to summarize I would say it should be user friendly by being easy to use
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0065404_0066192 rather than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering driven maybe having 100 buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066315_0066622 like volume control or channel changing the channel or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066741_0067462 but we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it we will punch in these two features together
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067462_0067737 so what the concept is to have a flip top model
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067737_0069035 The main functions which are often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to program their favorite channels or whatever.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069035_0069351 can be put in the middle part of the flip top.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069351_0070654 So it's like it could be accessed by a wide range of audience and we can punch in new features such as added features such as shockproof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0070826_0072814 findings most people prefer user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they have not used maybe 30 to 40% of the buttons so its of no use of punching in those trying to put in those things on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0072814_0073649 As you saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of higher production like 50 million we said.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0073649_0074378 Yeah, with that, I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also. So we can give in adding more features and make it less costly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0074762_0075212 that's so this is if you ask me personally I would make a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0075447_0076762 flip top with trendy design and we should look at the buttons whether they are soft or little hard because there are times the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0076762_0076903 Jadi, overall, yang simple.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077084_0077176 user friendly design.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077302_0077469 any comments
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080345_0080468 Check his ears.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080544_0080661 you can't
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080727_0080950 You'll have to, this can't be pulled.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081300_0081424 Push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081928_0082028 That was on.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0083436_0083550 या तो लिए टाओना
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0103476_0103651 Yn ogystal â hynny?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0112627_0113386 Programming. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0114090_0114129 10%
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0130021_0130539 So are we talking of a single model or maybe 5, 6 designs?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0131349_0131665 The features could be same and the body could look slightly different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0142436_0143060 yeah maybe to as it was indicated the risk of repeated use
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143060_0143427 the injuries maybe your touch screen could be a better option for that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143672_0144196 So, you are dividing designs based on not only segments, but also h2p's
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144196_0144633 here dividing it according to the countries also, the market.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144633_0145286 maybe for US and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have small
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0153750_0153940 विचाइन प्रवाद प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़ाइन प्राज़इन प्राज़इन प्राज़इन प्राज़इन प्राज़इन प्राज़इन प्
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0154040_0154364 I would say people between age 20 to 35 are the biggest.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0183560_0184036 I think I had too much of an effort for a person to... for a phone maybe he might walk down the street.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0184036_0184327 But for our remote, he will just report it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0192253_0192616 So are we talking about the concept of rechargeable something?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198282_0198846 what I was thinking of a design which Nokia came up with almost 6 or 7 years back.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198846_0199279 Basically we have a flat one, it looks like a box, like a chocolate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199279_0199946 that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they can move with something like this, curved up
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199946_0200218 and you don't have to bend your thumb too much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200218_0200588 So it's like a banana-shaped kind of thing, curled up like a boat.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200744_0201169 so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201249_0201901 so it's already curved up so we can have a molded according to your
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201997_0202359 the way you hold of it's kind of semicircle in the bottom something like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0202482_0202746 I want to see exactly same as you do.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0206728_0206856 We could look at that but...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207096_0207273 what we were talking is to make it more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207410_0207989 you could put a logo in the corner of the model
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207989_0208367 rather than you know trying to make it like a sea shell or what you are telling me.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0209025_0209098 See you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0211055_0211171 Yeah, we'll do the burning.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215455_0215628 maybe we could commit some step by step
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215628_0216163 designs and then choose which are which are appeals to like that could be the most common design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0216283_0216461 we can think of five, six reasons.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0226542_0226773 for being lost.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0229030_0229156 And different from what
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232357_0232411 It's not good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232559_0232680 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232928_0232967 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0000002_0000202 I'll wait until you're all ready.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0005239_0005447 I
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008008_0008387 Welcome back everybody. Hope you had fun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008544_0009352 Rwy'n meddwl y byddwn yn ymwneud â'r cyfleoedd ymgyrch. Rwy'n meddwl y byddwn yn ymwneud â'n ei hun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0009477_0009969 from last meeting
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0010104_0011160 This is where we talk about properties, materials, user interface and trend watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011269_0011501 So I think we've touched on a few things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011664_0011891 to do that already, but we'll just go over it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012298_0012602 the minutes from last time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012602_0013372 We had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use tally text.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0013372_0014280 oedd y byddai'n ei wneud yn ymdrech i'r holl ffordd, ac roeddwn i'n cymryd y ffyrdd o'r company yn ei wneud yn unrhyw ffordd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0014472_0016044 We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition. We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016044_0016539 We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, just different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016897_0017210 you are going to look into the rechargeable batteries.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017331_0017939 and we're going to think about the port and alarm for getting it lost, things like that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017939_0018862 and our market was going to be young business kind of range.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0018862_0019193 Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0019193_0019284 Yes, if you feel.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0024946_0025060 It's for change.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0035729_0035965 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036149_0036391 Let's start from the inside and work our way out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036755_0036949 Yeah, take a second.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0037104_0037309 Yes. Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0038856_0038972 I hate those little things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0039096_0039596 Especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0049745_0049886 to be honest people want
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050012_0050260 basically like wind up radio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050494_0050799 How long can you get out of that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050799_0051223 I mean, can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053146_0053294 when you've got TV.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053378_0053790 Mae'n dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053961_0054086 Any? Any?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0055701_0055969 I'm pretty sure the seller is from the sun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056054_0056835 I don't think it counts electric lights. But I mean, not many, you don't want to limit your market
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056835_0057300 Rwy'n meddwl, rwy'n meddwl, y bobl sy'n byw yn y clas ysgol, nid yw'r holl o bobl. Ond mae o bobl.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058059_0058272 But then it would be charging to the day.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058272_0058872 Rwy'n credu bod y pwynt yw bod yna llwybr y dydd, ac yna mae'n llwybr.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0059540_0059632 Yeah, I see.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064002_0064729 But then if you think about watch, it's on your wrist, so it's on your whole body, it's on your body the whole time. Yeah. So you're walking around.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064729_0065014 you're doing things it is moving a lot of the time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065014_0065289 I mean you switch the TV on and you put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065289_0065588 then you pick it out to change it and then you put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065588_0065718 ومن ثم مجدداً
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0068177_0068398 it's not to draw on it is it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0069823_0069960 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071616_0071774 expensive as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071774_0072311 expensive
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0074029_0074161 The side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075002_0075156 Yeah, right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075916_0076308 Don't worry, they just have a battery in there as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080189_0080629 Okay, can we add in an attachment to clothing feature?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080799_0080978 Can we think about that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080978_0081433 because if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0081629_0081912 Rwy'n edrych yn ymwneud amdano.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082370_0082509 Where am I?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082509_0084553 If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do, we're doing something original and different, but if you wore it, if it's something you could just clip it in your pocket, then you would have that less
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084553_0084817 you wouldn't lose it so much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084951_0085271 But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0085412_0085659 the eternal battle for control of the control
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0087163_0087235 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091816_0091988 What kind of things do we have to consider today?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091988_0092807 Can we, what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size? And we would have to fit the design?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0111147_0111276 Yn ddiddordeb.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117621 So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0117621_0118084 Like those pens that you get with the grip. Yeah, right. That could be a good idea.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0118872_0119263 Well that's been really popular with mobile phones, so I don't see why not.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0129140_0129293 O, fe'n ddod yn dda.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131235_0131449 I think it would be good to have a contrast between
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131449_0132237 it's the whole thing it's going to be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0132237_0132764 Now how would you distinguish if you had it bare? How would you distinguish where you had to press?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0134328_0134463 I think it could fall out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0135045_0135233 Mae'n dda iawn i'w gael ei wneud yn y ffordd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137437_0137923 Okay, we'll talk about that. So if you finish your... Yeah, that's... I'll come back to that. Yeah, that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137923_0138131 That's the end.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144155_0144495 We are marketing to guys as much as we are to women.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144866_0144989 Wel, mae'n dda i'n gwybod
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144989_0145772 you were sitting watching TV are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the TV on.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0145952_0146152 Ie, dwi'n mynd i'r hyn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0148283_0148597 Alright, question one, six, question one, six.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0155824_0155938 जाओपाइप प्राइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइपाइ
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0160946_0161428 Can we swap that round to the ones that we used all the time on the bottom part?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161564_0161743 because if you think about holding it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161877_0162283 You would be using your thumbs to press, just like a mobile phone.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0163533_0164442 Mae'r LCD yn y ffordd ac yna gallwch i'w llwybr hynny i'r pethau arall.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0164442_0165203 So it has the volume and the program and things like that on the lower side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0175745_0176007 Dwi ddim yn gallu gweld beth yw'r ddod yn ystod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0176145_0176343 Is that volume and channel?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0179203_0179843 I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180107_0180200 the things we discussed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180270_0180650 So we agree on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180781_0180899 Do we agree on the battery?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181306_0181831 That means that there's no function for the port.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181831_0182425 Mae'n cymryd yn ystod y llwybr bres, felly gallwn ni gysylltu bwysig yn ymwneud â'r bwysig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182425_0182687 It's a gadget.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182807_0182892 It's called...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0184800_0184921 I think the only...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185031_0185833 I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost. If that means we have to cut down somewhere else.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185833_0186520 But I think pretty much we've used cheap, relatively cheap and simple things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0186520_0186655 LCD is not tuned.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0187652_0187765 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0188079_0188197 That would be good.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0189165_0189312 Do you want like a backup?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191274_0191588 Okay, so I've got the battery.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191588_0192062 The inside component is pretty standardised across the board, isn't it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192189_0192592 So there's not really a decision to be made there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192808_0193128 the buttons what did you give us as a
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0193474_0193716 The bare board LCD.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0194471_0194948 on the top one, okay, you've got the touch. Okay. And then
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0195625_0195847 Okay. Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0197336_0197415 No, it's fine.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0198156_0198256 For the inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0199200_0199392 I think so.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0200704_0201858 No, I think we don't want to be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway. The fact, the material that we would be using would be cheap.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0201858_0202008 so we could make it red.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202008_0202770 We could make it psychedelic. We could make it black and white zebra stripes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202770_0203384 Ond dyna nid yw'r hyn rydym yn ffocwsio ar y peth y mae'n ffocwsio ar y peth y mae'n...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0203384_0203662 So I could just pick anything.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0205521_0206423 That's just different. It's different. It's just different from everything else. I mean, I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0206423_0207105 sort of beige and black. Do you either want something that goes with that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207105_0207294 which is what's on the market anyway.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207294_0208360 or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0209428_0210011 and you would just have it across the board, you would have so many different options that you could do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0210011_0210708 You could have a plain black one. You could have sparkly pink glittery ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0211630_0212456 a phosibau sydd ganddi'r cyfnodau'n fwyaf. Roedd angen i chi ddod yn y ffordd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0212456_0213177 like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so I think that's quite a flexible
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0215226_0215710 Okay, we've got five minutes. Um, well that might have been up for a while.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0222133_0222216 Have you?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0223557_0224476 Wel, maen nhw'n ei wneud, ond rwy'n meddwl y gallwn... Mae'n un o'r bwysau ar y marn? Wel, mae'n. Rwy'n meddwl y gallwch chi ddatblygu hynny gyda'r adfiniad.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0224476_0225035 y gallwch chi gysylltu'r enw gyda'r product yw, a dyna'r gweithdor ar gyfer eich hyn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225035_0225419 Mae'n rhaid i chi fod yn cael y logo yn ymlaen fel y byddai'r byd yn cael y logo yn ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225419_0226057 The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently. But I think it does without that, so I'm not worried about that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0226877_0227640 depending on how, depending on the expense of it. I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into so
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0227763_0228698 that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive and we'd have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0228698_0229151 I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229151_0229325 Right, I'm going to wrap it up here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229632_0230258 Ac o, end mynd i'r nôr, mae'n dda i'w ddod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0230519_0231255 So I think we've probably got, it says closing we have 40 minutes. So I think we've probably got about that time before we come back.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231436_0231523 Is either that or?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231623_0232110 We only had 14 minutes to discuss what we just discussed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0232570_0232677 Is everyone happy?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0001757_0001913 I'm going to make a sandwich with this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019124_0019210 Yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019333_0019451 Just connect up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0020110_0020144 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021791_0021898 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021898_0022800 Oherwydd, rydym wedi'i ddeall ar ein ddarparu, ac felly y ffyddiadau o'r ddarparu'r ddegwyddiad yw'r hyn am gweld ymchwil.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0022936_0023239 The methods we use to decide on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023460_0023678 current trends and so on, market trends.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023678_0024933 Rwy'n meddwl bod ni wedi gwneud ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ym mhobol, gyda'r 100 gwaith. Mae'r cyfleoedd cyffredinol o'n nhw yn y ffordd yw, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n ddweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dweud, rwy'n dwe
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0024933_0025119 It's for change.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025119_0025656 Rydyn ni wedi'i ddeall am y rhan bwysig y gallwn ei ddeall yn ymwneud â'r adeiladau ymgyrch ymlaen ac rydym yn mynd i hynny nesaf.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025656_0025849 So that was one of the first things we did.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025849_0026370 ac hefyd â'r cyfansedd o'n ffordd i'w gweithio mewn i'r technoleg.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0026370_0026908 Rydyn ni hefyd yn edrych ar gyfer ymddygiad ffasiwnol ym Mhobr Cymru.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0027029_0028144 Felly, y ffiniant yma o hynny yw, yn ffrindiau ymarfer, y rhan bwysig o ran ymddygiadau yma yw, mae pobl yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028144_0028599 yn y ffordd a'r ffuncciwm gwaith a chyfrif o gynhyrch ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028599_0028955 Mae'n hollol gwybodaeth i'n gwneud ymddygiadau technologol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029089_0029420 and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029420_0029974 Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029974_0030639 sy'n ddaf yn ddaf yn ddaf fel y ddwyloedd technol, sy'n ddaf yn ddaf yn ddaf fel y bydd yn ddaf i'w ddefnyddio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0030783_0031218 So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third. It's still important.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031218_0031695 Mae'n ddiddordeb yn ogystal â'r cyfle rydyn ni wedi gweld ar hynny.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031695_0032413 Yn ogystal â'r ffunysiwn ymddygiad sy'n cymryd i ddwy cyfranniaethau personol am y grŵp hwnnw.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0032413_0033086 Mae'n ddod o'r cyngor o'n paratoedd a'r Melanne, sy'n cael eu hysgol yn ffasfiadau ffasfiadol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033086_0033505 Mae'r ffrwyth a'r llwybr yn ystod y teimau i ffwrdd, llwybr a'r fferm.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033505_0033912 Felly, gallai ei fod yn meddwl am ddefnyddio rhywbeth fel hyn yn unrhyw ddeall cyngor.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034013_0034785 Mae'n ogystal â'r ffyrdd yn ymwneud â'r ffyrdd yn ymwneud â'r ffyrdd yn ymwneud â'r ffyrdd ym mhob.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034785_0035432 Felly, mae yna llawer o ffodd ddiddorol, yn ymwneud â phobl ymgyrch ym Mhobl a phobl ym Mhobl yn Parys a'r Llan.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0035432_0035654 Mae'n bwysig i weld beth y byddai'r bobl yn gwneud o'r dylunio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036543_0036742 Mae'r unrhyw un o'r berson yn gwybod am hynny.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036742_0036901 Yeah, take a seat.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0039387_0039590 I'm doing it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053232_0053491 When you got TV.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053491_0053571 I'm not.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053916_0053999 Any
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056191_0056303 Electric mind.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056527_0056624 That's not many.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0057116_0057532 But there are people.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0068504_0069132 Yn ystod y cyfleoedd, yw hyn yn ymwneud â bataurau bach?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069132_0069148 and we'll be right back.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069148_0069726 A allai pobl yn rhoi bateriaethau bach? Ond gallai ei wneud yn y ddau yn y soled, fel y chanol? Ond mae'r ddau pethau nid yn ymwneudol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0071449_0071648 identical.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0076735_0076799 The question is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0079650_0080160 Mae'n bwysig o'r atredullfa o'r ffordd yma.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0081231_0081853 A allwn ni ddod o ddysgu am hynny cyn amdano?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0085715_0086369 Nid yw'n rhywbeth sydd wedi dod yn unrhyw ffocws a'r gweithreduau a'r hyn sy'n cael eu gweithredu.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086484_0086645 And you throw it open to the field.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086804_0087020 Mae'n rhywbeth i'w gynnig ar y llwybr i ddysgu amdano.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115209_0115444 It doesn't come easy if you let it fall.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115444_0115944 ac mae'n dda'n ddaeth yn dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115944_0116500 Roeddwn i'n meddwl a ydym yn gwneud y molygau basig o plasig, ond mae'n cael ymddygiad o ddod o'r cyfrwng.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0116500_0116979 a'r cydnabod y gallwch chi'n ceisio'r cydnabod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0117431_0117601 off for the freedom wrapper.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0118463_0118836 Mae'n ffordd ddiddorol i weithio'r llwybr a gall pobl ddod o'r newydd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128514_0128876 Rwy'n ddiddorol i'w ddod yn y ffordd, dwi'n gweld pam y pethau'n gwych.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128876_0129431 Os ydym ni, fel ymchwil, oedd y bryd yn ystod. O, byddwn yn ystod. Roeddwn yn gallu cael y bryd yn ystod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0129595_0129708 But I'm just wondering whether
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0132981_0133449 Rwy'n meddwl y byddai'n helpu â hynny, ond i wneud â'r RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133449_0133915 Mae'n bosibl, fel ymwneud, pan dymunwch, mae pobl yn gallu defnyddio'i ddwylo i ddysgu'r botwm.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133915_0134516 or we have inside like a small pointer thing. Yeah you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0135041_0135232 Mae'n dda i'n cydweithio'r cyfle i'w gyrraedd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0136802_0137175 They wouldn't actually need one in the case of anything they've got, couldn't they?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0137175_0137398 我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著我看著
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141328_0141902 Mae'n dweud un pwmpen arall sy'n cymryd i mi, mae'n cymryd i'r dyluniau borthoedd yma, ond nid y byddai'n ei ffynu.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141902_0142008 If we flip open...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142008_0142721 Now you know how you've got some mirrors in night gloves that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142721_0142795 You see those?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142893_0143138 a'u cydnabod yn y tôn eich bod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0143138_0144102 Is it possible that when we open our flip top shell, it's a little compact mirror, and when you press a button, it then goes onto the phone display, the operating room control display.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144533_0144638 Can I take a look at myself?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144773_0144835 Just a thought.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145341_0145424 A, ojczeć.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145424_0146099 Felly mae'n defnyddio'r ideaau ar ffôn mabl, mae gennym ddod o'r hyn yn ymwneud â hynny, dwi'n meddwl.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0146202_0146611 Rwy'n eich ymddygiad am ddod o feintiau a byddwn yn gallu gwneud ymlaen, ond nid oes yn dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0148117_0148530 Felly roeddwn yn gwybod am y mirau. Dyna'r ffordd yn dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0155760_0155881 Sorry, what does that mean?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162257_0162492 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162703_0162747 Wouldn't you?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162747_0162868 Not the idea.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162868_0163243 Os ydym yn ddefnyddio'r siel fel exemple, a chyflwyno'r gwaith.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0163243_0163660 Mae'n dda'r display yna a'r botn yna.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0188370_0188958 Rwy'n siŵr am ymwneud â chyflau cynyddiadau, oeddwn yn dweud y byddwn yn dweud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud am ymwneud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0189425_0190016 un o'r deisiau y byddwn ni'n mynd i'w wneud yw ein bod ni wedi cael y batrys AAA neu AAA oherwydd mae'n rhaid i'w gael i fod yn ymwneud yno.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190016_0190091 sequence, come with me.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190507_0190607 Right, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190840_0191062 I just want you on that one too.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0195977_0196170 Felly, a allwch chi ddechrau y peth nesaf?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0196365_0196464 Go.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0198820_0199377 Felly rydym wedi'i ddechrau ar casu'r gosod o ddod o'r gosod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0199597_0200180 Mae'n dda i fod yn ymwneud â'r ffwrdd a'r ffwrdd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0200180_0200831 a ddylai'r cyfle i'w gwneud yn eich hunain, neu unrhyw beth oherwydd?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203180_0203228 Me fío.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203764_0204429 Mae'r cyfnodion y ddaf yn fy nghymru o rhywbeth fel hynny, efallai o bryd hynny.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204429_0204917 a'n gwneud o plasig, yn ymwneud â'r gwaith, cyd-dwyll a'i gwybwyno.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204917_0205635 Mae hynny'n bwysig i'n mynd i'r ffeilio'n ffansiol, a'r pethau mawr y bydd pobl yn eich eu gwneud. Mae hynny'n anodd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208230_0208684 Mae'n bwysig fel y byddai'n dod â'r unrhyw beth. Ond rwy'n hoffi'n deall.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208684_0209080 Rydyn ni'n edrych ar y llesau o'r cyhoedd. Mae'r ddau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn ddaethau yn d
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0209080_0209463 Mae'r bwysau hynny'n gwneud yn gwneud yn fwy o bwysau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210551_0210871 ...and the other miscubers are going to be so relatively cheap to produce.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210871_0211662 Mae'n dda iawn i'w gweithio o'r ffeiriau dylenol sydd angen i'w gwneud. Mae'n dda i ni gael gwaith amdanoedd sydd angen i'w gwneud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0211662_0211788 Sounds good.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0215644_0216382 Felly, a allwn ddweud ymlaen am ddechrau hynny, ymgyrch ymgyrch ymlaen, y batreidd ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216382_0216871 Lcd display yn y tŷ y flwyth y tŷ.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216871_0217586 y botwm yn y ffordd. Rydyn ni'n mynd i ddechrau ffwrdd a llwybr ar gyfer y ffwrdd. Mae'r cas ynddo yn plasig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0217586_0217853 Dyna'r ffordd y gallwn ni'n ei wneud. Beth yna dda i'n ei wneud i'n ei wneud?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219094_0219334 So, I'll be looking at voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219334_0219636 but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0221703_0221964 And incorporating the company logo.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0222656_0223061 Roeddwn i'n mynd i'r ffyrdd o'r ffyrdd y gweithredu chi'n cael yn y cyfnod yma o'ch cyfnod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223061_0223585 Mae'n dda i fod yn ogystal â chymhwyso ar gyfer rhai o'r ffitnys. Mae'n rhaid i'w ddod yn bwysig bod yw'n rhan o'r gwaith.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223838_0224119 Is it the only one of its kind on the market? Well it is, it is.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226150_0226432 Did we, I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226432_0226842 Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n ymwneud â'r lleiaethau. Rwy'n reitio hynny yn ffyrdd ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0230669_0230756 It says...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0009601_0009826 Yeah, I was getting the impression.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0036429_0036582 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0038097_0038352 Let's move.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0041188_0042252 Mae'r bwysig yw'r adnoddau'r gwaith a'r gwasanaethau y gallwn ei ddyddio yn ystod y moment.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042252_0042507 Felly, ymlaen,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042623_0042742 into the method
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042742_0043948 Mae'r bwysig yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw, yw
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0043948_0044473 Hefyd yn y study hwn, rydw i wedi gweld yn y cyfle o'r materiol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0044473_0045055 oherwydd rhai o'r pethau a ddylai'n edrych ar y ddaeth yna, nid yw'n ymwneudolol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045266_0045596 Findings, I've got my nice little picture there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045596_0046596 Dyma'r cwp tŷ TAA11835, sy'n cael ei ddefnyddio yn bob ganddynt oherwydd mae'n cymryd cyngorau diwylliannol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0046596_0047486 o ran ymddygiad yma, ac mae'n bwysig i gyd i bob ffrindiau TV ar y moment.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047486_0047853 Ac yna rydym yn edrych ar y pethau ymchwil.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047986_0048454 Mae nifer o gweithredu cyfrifol yn cael eu gynnig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0048454_0049370 Felly roeddwn i'n gweld y stannol, A a A A, a dydyn ni'n credu bod yn dda i'r amser.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0049370_0050219 Dyno-chargell, dwi'n credu bod hynny'n dda iawn i fod yn dda, i fod yn dda, mae'n dda fel radio'n fwyaf.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050219_0050626 So you wind up your remote control before you use it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050626_0050702 ونحن نتحدث عن نفسه
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051215_0051688 Yeah, yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it very long.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051688_0052412 Ond dwi ddim yn credu bod hynny'n bwysig pan dwi'n credu bod y ddau opsiwn ddiogelwch yn dda.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0052412_0053316 fel y churwch ddysodol oherwydd mae'r rhai o bobl wedi'i ddod yn y rhan yn oed yn oed fel y gallant gael pan oedd gennych chi'n
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053691_0053742 Is it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053742_0053910 Alright
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055103_0055725 Mae'r dynamo'n mynd yn ei ddod yn fwy o bwysig oherwydd byddwch chi'n angen gwasanaethau ffysicol i ddod.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055977_0056085 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0057514_0058039 Mae'r rhai o bobl yn gweld TV yn y noes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0058725_0059062 Felly, dwi'n credu y bydd y peth nesaf yn y ffordd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059062_0059834 y chynethol, sy'n cael ei gysylltu yn ymddangosion.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059834_0060386 I mean the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge you up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0060386_0060805 Dwi ddim yn credu bod angen i chi ddod yn ymddygiadol i wneud hynny gweithio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0061351_0062662 Mae'n llai'n ymwneud i unrhyw ffordd, mae'n llai'n ymwneud i unrhyw ffordd, ac mae'r cyfnod yn ymwneud i unrhyw ffordd,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062662_0062874 because they use them quite frequently in watches.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062874_0064041 a dyna'r ddau o bryd. Dwi ddim yn gwneud yn ddiweddar am sut yna'r ddau, ond dwi wedi gweld un o'r ddau yn ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0064990_0065140 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0065538_0066039 yeah but then again I think it is because if you think about it the watch
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0066039_0067333 Er enghraifft, nid yw'r blynyddoedd yn unig, mae'n bwysig i'w gweithio'r holl dydd, ac maen nhw'n dweud y byddai'n mynd yn ymwneud â'u gwybodaeth.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067333_0067624 ac i'r unrhyw rheswm.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067624_0068678 Mae'n dda i'n dda i'w ddod yn ystod ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0069582_0070774 Mae'r ddau ffordd yn ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n ddaethu'n dda
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0070774_0071499 Os ydych chi, fel ar y caliwyr, maen nhw'n bach, maen nhw'n bach yn fwy fwy, a maen nhw'n edrych yn ymddygiadol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0071725_0071915 expensive
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0072299_0073132 Mae'r bachau normalol yn y bachau'n bwysig, rwy'n meddwl bod yna'r bachau'n bwysig, ond y bachau'n bwysig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073243_0073799 Rwy'n credu ei fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i fod yn dda i Felly, mae'n dda i fod yn dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n dda i Felly, Mae'n d
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073799_0074827 because if you drop stuff, yeah, if you have the size you'd need to charge a remote it wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0074990_0075189 Practicalise. Practically.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0075365_0076057 I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot. Whereas remotes you do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0076239_0076697 Ie, maen nhw'n cael pethau dylen, ond mae'r batrydd yn fwy fwy.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077618_0077833 control like so yes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077962_0078479 yeah the this if you if you had something using the standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078600_0078967 a'r bach.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078967_0079783 Dwi'n meddwl y byddai'r ddaethau a'r ddaethau'n dweud y gwnaeth y byddai'r ddaethau a'r ddaethau yn dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud y gwnaethau'n dweud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0079932_0080195 Yeah, I think it would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087220_0087329 Okay, well I'll move on.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0089550_0091768 byddai'n gysylltu'r cyrff.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0092714_0093013 Well, the thing about it is...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0093157_0094354 Mae'r gwella yn gallu bod yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn oed yn o
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094354_0094603 os ydych chi'n gweld sut yn dynu'r traethau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094603_0095211 gallwch eu hynny'n ymwneud yn ymwneud â'u cyfan ac yn cael swyddi'n fwy fwyaf ar un yma.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0095211_0096216 os ydych chi eisiau. Ond mae yna gafodd i'w wneud fel hyn, neu gallwch chi gael rhai
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096359_0096753 array switches which I'll speak about in the next bit.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096908_0097666 ac yna i, ie, i gysylltu bach, mae'r ffordd yw bod yn ystafellol, er mwyn ei ddefnyddio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0097666_0098463 Ac roeddwn i'n meddwl am hynny oherwydd bod yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oherwydd yna oheroedd
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0098463_0099218 so you can see what all the buttons are. I like on a mobile phone to do it more often than on an ATV remote.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099218_0099999 gallwch chi gael llwybr ar ôl y botn, ac yn ogystal â 5 neu 10 ddeg sydd wedi'i ddefnyddio, rwy'n cael hynny'n gweithio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099999_0100304 os ydym yn ddechrau i fynd i'r botn, sy'n gallu llwythu.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0100491_0101417 Mae'r materioedd yma wedi'i cyfrannu a ddod oedd yr ymgyrch yn gallu i ni.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0101417_0102327 Mae'r plasig, a dwi'n credu ei fod yn mynd i'r ffordd, yn y casau bwydol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0102459_0103250 the main problems with the... well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0103250_0104324 titanium, iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn iawn
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0104324_0105188 Mae'n dweud bod pobl yn gobeithio'r ffeil spongewch hwnnw, felly efallai rhywbeth o ddod o'r rhwb.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105188_0105650 ond roeddwn i'n meddwl yn fwy o'r botynau oherwydd y botynau y mae'n ei dweud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105785_0106024 that they've put across.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106153_0106991 yw'r ymddiriedigion sy'n cael ei ddefnyddio yn unrhyw ffurfio'n anhygoel ac mae'n debyg bod yn anhygoel am ymddiriedigion.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106991_0107867 Dwi'n bwysig sut byddai'n gweithio oherwydd byddai'ch ddod o'ch ddod yn byw yn ymwneud â'r cyfle ddysgol, ond dyna beth yma'n ei ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0107867_0108482 ac y problem gyda'r casyn yw bod yna
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0108608_0109417 Mae'n rhaid i ni ddysgu am y ffordd o'r cas
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109417_0109818 If you go for titanium, they can only do a standard box shape.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109818_0110496 Ond os ydych chi'n mynd i'r plasig, gallen nhw'n mynd i'r ffaith yn fwy. Gallen nhw'n mynd i ffaith yn fwy.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0110496_0110920 but whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0111136_0111242 Felly, flitsen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112321_0112383 Yeah, I
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112823_0113240 Ie, yn titanium dwi ddim'n credu bod yn cael ei gael at all.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113240_0113765 just it would well you could make it available in the titanium
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113765_0114170 Mae'n bwysig i'n mynd i'r cas newydd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0114170_0115100 because of the expensive how much titanium is. It's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115243_0115311 for my
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115672_0115851 Yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116388_0116511 Rubber, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116863_0117008 And you can peel them off, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0119373_0120482 Hefyd, yn y ffordd i'r gweithredu cyhoeddus cyhoeddus, roeddwn yn planu gwneud rhyw ffordd o ddysgrifio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0120482_0121957 Yr hyn y byddaf yn dweud ymlaen am, yn ystod o gael, gallwch chi gael unrhyw gyrffur PCB, ac rwy'n siwr y gallwch chi gael hynny mewn cwyliau gwahanol, ac roedd y cydnabod yn ymwneud â'ch ddwylo a gwneud y gysylltiad.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122071_0122465 os ydych chi'n gwybod nhw'n lles iawn, dyna ffordd un.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122465_0122835 ym mhob ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymneud
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122835_0123831 ond roeddwn i'n credu bod y scren LCD yn unig oherwydd un, mae'n dda'n ddaidd yn dda, a dynnu'n gwybodaeth.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0123831_0124958 Two, you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing. You could have them like a touch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125432_0125558 Uh, what?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125910_0127015 O, ar y sgri'r LCD. Gallwch chi'n ffitio. Mae'r problem gyda'i, yn y ffordd, yw bod yn ddaeth yn ddaeth, felly gallwch chi ddod llawer o gyfrif.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127015_0127827 but you wouldn't have with the LCD you'd have the wires coming off you wouldn't have that with the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127940_0128210 with the LCD, you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0128504_0128659 Also with the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129264_0129906 You can have a flat screen inside. Yeah. But I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129906_0130571 it wouldn't be like full colour it would just be black and white but there'd be touch buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0130571_0131188 Felly nid oes yn bwysig i ni. A gallwn ni gael bwstyns brub yw'r materiw yw'r anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0131618_0131678 Bravo.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0132839_0133139 Ie, dwi ddim yn meddwl hynny.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134130_0134192 Yeah, you too.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134192_0135048 gallwch chi gael unrhyw styliad y gallwch chi ddod o, ond rwy'n credu bod nhw'n gallu cael eu gael ychwanegol.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0136768_0136855 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0137738_0138096 Yeah, that's the end.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0138991_0139069 Oh yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139363_0139573 Yeah, yeah, that would be fairly simple.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139573_0140740 Rwy'n meddwl, mae gennych chi ddwy bwrdd cyfrannol, ond maen nhw'n ymwneud â gweithiau neu rhyw ffyrdd yma.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0140740_0141112 because in the actual flip, you'd have some linking.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0146938_0147093 I mean you can't, you could do it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147093_0147921 oherwydd os ydych chi'n mynd i'r llwythoedd cyllideb drwy'r ddysplai LCD neu'n gwneud yn oed yn ymwneud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147921_0148233 but I don't know if you can get any mirror effect on that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0156418_0156912 os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych chi'n gwybod, os ydych
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0163508_0163805 Dyna'r hyn y bydda i'n ei ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0174354_0174537 Well, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182295_0182473 Yeah, I think, I mean...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182707_0183573 Mae'n ffyniad dda iawn i'w gael, a hefyd os yw'n cael y gauau hynny yn dda.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0183573_0184148 then it won't be cheap to remanufacture. It will be cheap, so to remanufacture.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184148_0184662 Felly, a allwch chi'n meddwl yw hynny'n dda iawn am sut y ffwrdd? Rwy'n ymwneud hynny.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184662_0184793 I think that would be quite fun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0186500_0187432 LCD yw nid yn llwyr. Mae'n dda i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r cyfle i'r
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0187432_0187668 And they use them in calculators.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189054_0189228 What you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189926_0190502 Nid, mae'r cyntafau cyntafau'n dod â bach y gallai'n mynd i'r bach.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0190615_0190857 Felly mae'n llawer fwyaf o'r ddau, felly byddwn yn...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0193636_0194134 Yeah, I think we're going for the LCD on the buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0194134_0194770 ar y... ar y... ar y rhan cyntaf. Y rhan cyntaf, ok, mae gennych chi'r tach.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0195004_0195515 On the bottom we're going to have the rubber ones, the anti-RSR ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0196178_0197020 Yn y fflip ysgrif, y pwmp yn y LCD a'r bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bwmp yn y bw
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0198019_0198162 Plastic. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0200605_0200649 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0212137_0212251 You could just go.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0214132_0215132 Ie, ie, gyda'r rôl hynny, rôl hynny, nid ymddygiad cyffredin, ond rôl rôl hynny.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0220154_0220323 Oh yeah, yeah, the whistle ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0226986_0227165 Yeah, depending on the expense of it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0227609_0227779 I've got him stalked.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0229935_0229994 Did it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0008247_0008327 อินิกา
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0036430_0036499 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054083_0054598 Regarding the sizes, which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration sizes also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054598_0055216 So maybe standard AAA might take less space, or Dynamo might take more space. Yeah, it would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0060854_0061353 What is the life of the kinetic battery? It runs for a long time?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0064027_0064066 if you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0071528_0071765 Mae'n dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0072058_0072205 I presume the normal battery
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076724_0076992 and the question is like
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076992_0077461 Which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be charging like a mobile phone everyday
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0077596_0077934 So yes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111124_0111763 Second question is like mobile you can change the cover, cover the skin or whatever
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111763_0112363 So in this case if you are looking at customer can change the color like from green, parrot green to chilli red or something like that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0112363_0112923 Is that feature available in titanium or it's only specific to plastic?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117608_0117718 Like those pens.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117973_0118068 That could be a good idea.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0118192_0118395 It would be comfortable to hold on to.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125060_0125310 So I just play the last part.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125566_0125997 just what you said I didn't get the meaning of it completely
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0134989_0135328 It's easy to replace as much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0135328_0136485 A person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use. And he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button like this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0136485_0136741 if you keep punching with a point over
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138042_0138503 Regarding the circuit since we are having a clip top
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138503_0139147 We can customize the two circuits for different type of buttons. Like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the complex buttons on the bottom.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0139147_0139304 So, we can divide the circuit like this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148592_0148738 Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148998_0149237 I wanted to share something which I did here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149237_0149677 First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous MIDI
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149677_0150290 especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150290_0150802 Second is we check into competitors. The picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150802_0151570 So you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy they are both black and white
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0151570_0152116 So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152292_0152729 and second thing is there's too much of confusion here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152729_0152905 No particular remote is standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153118_0153286 like some some people have
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153441_0153591 Here you see this
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153591_0153741 This is on, uh, I,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153858_0154292 I found that only common feature is the channel control and the volume control.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154292_0154798 Rest other buttons, they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154928_0155214 Okay, and second, as already discussed with William.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0155214_0156212 we are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the middle of the flip top and graphic user interface basically which is what we do in computer
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156212_0156505 have icons or touchpad over top
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156891_0157538 like you have icons or something, it's a good example of GUI, graphic user interface.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0157634_0157921 So basically a person in that point of click
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158012_0158431 press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158431_0159281 and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means user button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159281_0159776 So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent circle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159878_0160312 So we are having a combination of both. So on the simpler board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0160312_0160780 on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164344_0164499 Okay
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164949_0165076 Sa mga lalang.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165076_0165165 Oh, thanks.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165562_0165774 So the findings are too many claret wood buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165863_0166384 repetition of certain patterns which I have already explained in the example of the volume and channel control buttons
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166384_0166613 all are confusing and inconsistent.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166613_0166912 Okay, we had a little finding of voice recognition. There was a main
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167049_0167557 which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167557_0168273 we have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0168273_0169125 but for like we had response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169125_0169527 So it could be like, where is the remote? And the remote answers, I am here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169527_0170446 some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more trendy also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170446_0170664 and technologically innovative also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170898_0171243 So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0171623_0172153 My personal preferences would be like, as already highlighted by the marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172153_0172555 they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172555_0173179 But yeah, we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors, red, chili.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0173301_0174236 tomato red or whatever and second thing is certain standard buttons we should have.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0174609_0175151 I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0175151_0175720 So we will not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176016_0176429 this is the signal volume and channel
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176429_0177106 So keep that standardized because that's the most common feature across all models. If you look at all the models, it's here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0178082_0178157 Voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0181014_0181081 Kind of
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0187746_0187925 maybe we could start with the black and white
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0188073_0188307 That would be good. Yeah upgrade later on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197144_0197260 and further.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197709_0198266 For the body design I think plastic. Plastic? Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0198266_0198782 for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0199172_0199264 I think
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0205544_0205727 It's just different.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0212288_0212491 So, part of the day, like a part of the day,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213084_0213742 Finally the body should be detachable, you can change the body of the case casing.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213742_0214102 It should be molded with the design in such a way you can change it everything.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0214919_0214966 Eu não sei se eu vou ter que fazer uma parte da...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0218025_0218991 We are talking of voice recognition also because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate remote control if it is lost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219083_0219306 So, are you looking at voice messages?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219578_0219981 or maybe like William Vissage String last thing some devices you put on keychains
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220136_0220425 Oh yeah, the whistle one. The whistle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220425_0220813 So if financially voice recognition is not feasible, we could go for a whistle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0222260_0222540 So I'm not mentioning that, but fielding incorporating in the design.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0230257_0230355 Again, a question now.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0232171_0232396 I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0000368_0000686 If you leave them on the whole time, you get to look like a noodle the whole time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0001995_0002074 MBC 뉴스 김수현입니다.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002393_0002526 and feet, apparently.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002738_0002856 Okay, I'll switch to them.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003272_0003390 You were good to go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003390_0003552 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003664_0003952 minutes. We decided to use a kinetic charger.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004093_0004564 standard chip, because it can come in various different sizes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004709_0004997 That can be a problem factor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004997_0005194 We wanted a standby function.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005194_0005672 The case materials can be soft, rubbery, changeable.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005672_0006122 buttons with a combination of LCD and rubber according to the design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006122_0006812 Mae'r adroddiadau'n bwysig, yn ymddygiad â phwy, yn ymddygiad â'r ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006812_0007631 and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we find out more about the cost of things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0007631_0008203 and the rubber buttons that we use will be anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0008858_0009029 Prototype presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0009260_0009381 I think that would be you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010325_0010586 Do you want to hold it like...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010901_0010995 Yes, yes you can.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010995_0011086 Obviously, I'll get it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012537_0012988 Just one last thing, and you can just take it off.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012988_0013135 짠
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0014172_0014215 for
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0020953_0021050 and the buns.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0021493_0021601 Oh, right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0023326_0023877 So put it in the top section rather than the bottom section because it's the top part that's...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027237_0027350 I'm undoing this so fast.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027464_0027593 I like every two go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0032909_0032972 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033289_0033662 I actually knew it would be, you'd have to be on the front side of that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033662_0033840 Oh right, yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033980_0034152 So when you've actually got to open it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0034235_0034335 Yeah, that makes sense.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0039904_0040303 but not interfering with the right side of the lip and lip product.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041343_0041510 Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041653_0041912 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041912_0042199 I've now got evaluation criteria.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0042707_0043170 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0045226_0045415 It's quite similar to what it was before, though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0058297_0058533 Just right smiling.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0060141_0060204 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0063692_0063765 I would agree.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0064951_0065004 I'll see you tomorrow.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0069602_0069659 I do.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0072117_0072286 It's just 2.5 for that one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0075853_0076076 I would say it too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0076076_0076158 and the same thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077244_0077443 One point seven.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077443_0077562 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0087136_0087889 Mae'r gwyb o ddwylo sy'n mynd i'w ddefnyddio yn y lles hwn, mae'r materiol yn ymwneud â'r cyfle sy'n dweud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088191_0088855 Maybe because it's slightly, with the size that we've got, it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it, it isn't that much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088855_0089231 So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around to...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089313_0089572 Okay, accurately the buttons in between.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089572_0089900 It's quite obvious, just big buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0095822_0095902 Understander.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096148_0096209 It would be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096383_0096845 And if you didn't hear it in the room you were standing in, then you realised it wasn't in that room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102140_0102218 I don't think so.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102431_0102558 I think we, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102558_0102627 I take a side.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0103784_0104040 too much apart from having a huge big
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105024_0105081 Do things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105433_0105566 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106383_0106722 Okay, I've got finance here now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106722_0107058 I'm going to put this in so you can all see it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111261_0111373 Now I presume...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111556_0111672 and scream a good night.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111791_0111963 that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0112668_0113201 we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113201_0113484 So I was still on for kinetic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113715_0113995 See, it would have been handy to have this at the beginning.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113995_0114217 It might have influenced our choice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0114509_0114789 Right, what's happening with the electronics?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0115794_0115886 Oh, no, no, no.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117120 Oh, right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117520_0117628 So would there be two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117973_0118028 One, two, three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119130_0119210 one double curl.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119730_0119868 So what's a single character?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0120288_0120438 So just one double.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0121644_0122034 We've got plastic and rubber, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0123290_0123329 Do you think?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0124483_0124648 It would be like saying we're using...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125074_0125261 See, it says case material.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125385_0125843 so we're not actually using plastic in the case.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125843_0126008 It's including, it's including.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0127840_0128124 Okay, we'll just put it in, we'll put it in as half.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128357_0128636 We should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128938_0129220 And we don't step on anyone's toes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129220_0129394 Okay, special color, do we need that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129643_0129734 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138235_0138315 That's not gonna come out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138315_0138673 Oh no, it's seven five, it's changed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0139863_0140057 It's not calculating.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140280_0140355 Okay, there we go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140434_0140639 And slightly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0141642_0141956 We haven't been dealing with dollars though, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142112_0142400 Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142723_0142945 If we draw the face...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146296_0146349 Worse than
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146444_0146567 Most of the voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146864_0146956 Right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147212_0147361 Well, the kinetic is 3.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147361_0147641 If we change it to batteries, that's minus three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148023_0148079 All right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148079_0148241 Keep singing, Zia.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148868_0149309 We can do it some other way, it doesn't have to be voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0149309_0150037 we could do the voice recognition for business class or something, like an upgraded version.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0150037_0150218 You could choose to have them or not.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0151326_0151659 So should we just change the design specification then?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154493_0154605 Okay, we can...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154748_0155625 Mae'n dweud, os oes gennym y pryd, byddwn yn cael hynny oherwydd mae'n eu cymryd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0155625_0156026 Mae'n hoffi'r gajau, mae'n hoffi rhywbeth sy'n gwneud yn gwahanol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156026_0156347 Mae'n rhan o bwydion gwahanol o bwydion sy'n cymryd â'r cyfan.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156347_0156467 Right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157505_0157721 Was it 12.50?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157721_0157907 No, it's 12.25.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158190_0158482 Yeah, well, 2.25 times 2 is...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158669_0158815 25.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0160463_0160841 I think the gender one was where the price was, wasn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162262_0162338 255.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162645_0162720 I've done people.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163089_0163418 So has that got us covered for the electronics then?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163418_0163680 We don't need something else to take that place.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0165733_0165921 All right, so I've done that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166372_0166561 project evaluation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166692_0166948 We've done Room for Creativity, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166948_0167513 because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't, didn't feel able to make.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0167748_0167997 I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168536_0168736 in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168915_0169188 Did you feel like a teen?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0169188_0169806 Or did you feel like... I think you were nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173184_0173296 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173296_0173446 How did you find it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0176832_0177869 Rwy'n gobeithio'r ffaith y gallwn ddweud un idea a byddai'n cymryd bod nid oes un idea'n fwyaf, ond nid oes un ffaith yn ymwneud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0177869_0178399 it didn't matter saying what you thought because if it wasn't something that was that relevant.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178399_0178669 and it didn't matter because it was just another idea in the field.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178669_0178828 I'm not doing that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179060_0179486 Well, you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179596_0180250 I think that was the best part of it. I'm still not caught up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0180250_0180551 That's nothing to do with the teamwork at all.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181444_0181597 That was quite fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181597_0182055 and means whiteboard digital pens etc. What does that mean?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0182055_0182133 Ich habe dich jetzt
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0183562_0183667 had time to kind of.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184151_0184614 Yeah, because we could just sort of say, sorry, what did you say about that? Or what do you think about that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184614_0184842 other than having to email you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184842_0184984 but it was nice having it there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0185103_0185350 like the whole picture of the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0189996_0190296 Yeah, I think it's the idea.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191575_0191709 And yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191709_0191888 Well they have to come from somewhere.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192020_0192299 As we... sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192299_0193197 As was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it particularly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193197_0193678 I mean they're slightly different so someone's been shot in the room and said my car is a bit different from everyone else's.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193678_0194216 because it's something we should think about. But obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196176_0196984 But then when everything is really smart, and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196984_0197713 I mean, if you could have something that's a proper funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0197713_0198494 I mean they could even go into, you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0198494_0199206 You'd pay a lot extra because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199206_0199556 but people could have anything that they wanted.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199712_0199792 President of the United States.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0203973_0204308 Well, it's innovation for money's sake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204308_0204544 that people have to keep forcing it onto people.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204806_0205290 and you can't get, you've got your hands at the works fine but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205290_0205582 because the phones have moved on, things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205778_0205904 That's very nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206223_0206361 In closing,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206460_0206619 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206619_0207514 Our costs are below budget with recommendations that the budget be increased.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0207514_0207752 Do you think that takes into account
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208156_0208471 like us being well paid kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208471_0208983 a'r hyn i'r buddill, a oes gennym ni'n gynnwys i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r holl bwyd sy'n mynd i'r ho
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209312_0209994 So it looks like it's going to be 50% profit, you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209994_0210623 So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price of the sold out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0210623_0210881 I think but you were saying that's quite
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213317_0213646 It's a shame it won't ever get made.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213646_0213744 Maybe I am.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213744_0213984 Thank you so much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214271_0214736 The project has been evaluated well and truly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214736_0215214 Mae'r cyfle yn ymwneud â'r cyfle.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215214_0215890 So we've got about 50 minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215890_0216450 So I'll be delegating my role as project supervisor. So good luck.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0216954_0217203 I think the celebration is the 25th.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0217288_0217464 Maybe we'll be dancing on the dance.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0137735_0138224 Mae'n bwysig, os ydych chi'n cymryd y sgrin yma, mae'n bwysig.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138224_0138383 Is that not gonna, oh no, send.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138626_0139126 Mae'n gweithio'n gwych yn unig ac mae'n dda i'w gwneud yn ymwneud â Robert Case, mae'n dda i'w gwneud yn fwyaf.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0139563_0139785 Mae'n fwy o ffrindiau i ni, nid?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0140346_0140507 Let's put it down slightly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0141636_0141773 We haven't been dating.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142747_0142880 If we try
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142988_0143645 Os ydym yn mynd ymlaen o'n ffordd ymddygiadau kinetig, a'r bachau bachau bachau bach, byddai hynny'n gwneud gwahaniaeth?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0145029_0145509 Mae'r holl ddau yn dda.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0146166_0146338 A allwn ni weld beth yw'r gwirionedd?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151180_0151459 But we're still working to... So should we just change the design?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151568_0151710 In our recitation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151710_0152186 Mae'r prosiect yma'n gweithio ar gyfer y gwasanaethau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152186_0152756 gallwn ni'n mynd yn ymwneud ymlaenau ni o'r ymgyrchau a'r gysylltiadau y gallwn ni ddod yn ymwneud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152756_0153037 Ond rydyn ni'n mynd i weithio i'r ysbytyfiant i ddechrau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153037_0153309 Ac rwy'n credu bod y cyhoedd yn dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153309_0153981 Ond mae'r obiect yn ddysgolol, a'i gael ei wneud yn eithaf yn ddiwygiol i'w gydweithio yn ystod ymwneud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153981_0154491 Fel y dywedwch, gallwn ddod o'r ddegwyddiad ymlaen i ffyrdd cymdeithasol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0155506_0155799 because we've done all the background work.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0156540_0156796 Felly os ydym yn ei wneud ymlaen,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0157258_0157321 very closely.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0157989_0158071 Sim, sim.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0158071_0158261 Felly, dwi'n mynd i ddweud yw'r bwyd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0158747_0158964 Mae'n dda i'n gwybod am 10p.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0159145_0159456 Mae'n dda iawn i'w gwneud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0159456_0159566 which is less than 10.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0161453_0161534 Dyna i ddod.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0181283_0181419 Felly, diolch.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0182059_0182550 I think I did hear a discuss which one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0182690_0182872 Could it have been better? Was it adequate?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0190085_0190483 Mae'n bwriadu o ran arall, mae'n bwyllio pethau o ran arall yn ymwneud â'r pethau arall.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201108_0201817 Mae'n bwysig bod yma wedi bod yn ddaeth ymgyrch ymgyrch ymgyrch ym mhobl ffonau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201817_0202407 Mae'r newydd ymlaen yn ymwneud â phobl ymgyrch ymgyrch y gallwn ddweud yw'n gwirioneddol a'i ddod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202407_0202851 Rydyn ni'n gweld hynny yn ffônau mobl yn llawer ac mae hynny'n ymwneud llawer o ideaidd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202851_0203137 There are innovations in that that people don't really want.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203137_0203687 Rwy'n gweld pobl sy'n eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich bod yn eich
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203687_0203961 Ac rwy'n credu bod y cyfnod y byddai'n dda i'n ddaol i'r cyfnod yn ddaol i'r cyfnod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204421_0204579 forcing it onto people.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204579_0204892 things that you know they might want to buy the thing they need.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205457_0205662 Ac nid oes angen cyfrifoedd i'w gysylltu.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205906_0205983 and
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0208960_0209296 I think it was just the production.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0210855_0211119 I think in the re-ment that we were given, it was very specific.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211119_0211269 I think we've done what we're required to do.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211269_0211781 Ac rwy'n credu bod yna ddiweddau unrhyw project neu unrhyw project ar gael i ni edrych ar hyn o bethau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211781_0212244 Dwi ddim yn credu bod hynny'n rhywbeth y mae'n rhaid i ni edrych arno i ddod o weithio'r ffordd o ddod o'r cas i.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0212398_0213152 Rydyn ni wedi gwneud yn fwyaf i ddod yn Badger a'i gwneud yn unigwyr hynny. Rwy'n credu bod pobl yn dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213477_0213648 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213648_0213692 네.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221077_0221151 I'm right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221151_0221379 Ond a oes gennym ni ddod o'r ffaith yma?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009137_0009262 for us.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009949_0010093 Yeah, shall I show you?

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0013863_0014453 Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, our final presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0014453_0015093 and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015277_0015894 Mae'n mynd i gael bod ymddygiad plasig gyda chyfrifol
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015894_0016555 whether we're thinking something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0016555_0017582 Mae'r hwn yn ystod y casyn ymlaen. Mae'r casyn ymlaen yn ystod y casyn ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017582_0017838 but we can come up with it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017838_0018731 Mae'r llyfr hŷn o ffrindiau a'r gynlluniau, felly mae gennych chi llawer o gysylltiadau gyda'i.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0018731_0020259 It's obviously in a sort of clam shell design and the top LCD screen that you can see there would be sort of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020371_0020670 The black and white touch screen? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020670_0021549 Mae'n ymwneud yn y cydnabod ac mae'r bandiau yn y gwybodaeth yn cael ei chwybodaeth.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021549_0021771 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021771_0022666 a gweithio ar y cydnabod gyda'r batreidd cyntaf, a dweud y byddai'n
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0022666_0023422 Mae'n ddiddorol am hynny heddiw, oherwydd gallwch hefyd yn ymddygiad â'r ddod yn ymwneud a'i chymysgu hefyd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0023993_0024362 Rydyn ni'n deall bod y system dynol yn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024362_0024997 ac roedd yn dweud yn ymwneud ymlaen, bod nhw'n mynd yn ystod a'u bod yn dda i gael gysylltiad.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024997_0025272 felly rydyn ni'n gwybod bod hynny'n dda iawn i'w gwybod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025272_0025780 So you'd have something like, you'd shout out, where is the remote?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025911_0026127 It'll shout back, I'm here or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026345_0026723 And then, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026723_0026955 It wouldn't shout out on here or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026955_0027532 It was just a chat on him or something too similar.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0027532_0028157 Yeah, if it was getting there, well that could be something for next time, maybe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028157_0028476 You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028476_0029174 Mae ymwneud y cyfrannu'r cyfrannu'n ymwneud â'r TV yn ddefnyddio'r cyfrannu'r ymwneud â ni.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029174_0029767 Mae'n rhaid i'n gweithio oherwydd bod hi'n gweithio ar ddau gwahanol bwyd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029767_0030462 it would need two separate PCBs that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0030462_0031657 Ac oherwydd bod pob teulu'n ddefnyddio'r mediant infrared yr un, byddwn yn ddefnyddio'r un peth i gysylltu'r datblygiad.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031657_0031836 and the infrared
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031988_0032552 Mae'r sendr yn un o'r lles bach.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0032552_0032972 Mae'n dda i'n edrych ar y ffynedd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033080_0033210 Yeah, yeah, something like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033420_0033651 Yeah, on the front side of that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033990_0034391 Felly pan fyddwch chi'n mynd i weithio, bydd yn ei wneud yn y tŷ.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034391_0034801 A yna, yn ffordd, y cydnabod.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0038061_0039089 Ac nawr, rydym hefyd wedi deall, ar y cydnabod, gallwn efallai efallai efallai cael rhan o ddwyll.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0039240_0039783 o'r logo arno neu rhywbeth o'r gweithio o'r logo ar y tydd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040004_0040229 No, not actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040229_0040867 No, not interfering with the whole look of the product when it's out on the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040867_0041709 And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics. Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0042881_0043105 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0060100_0060169 也好
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0063870_0064567 Yeah, I'd probably put it. Two, yeah, two or three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0064567_0064642 No, three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066278_0066375 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066839_0066952 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0068639_0068737 I'd give it a 1.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0069005_0069175 No, no, not at all.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080119_0080264 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080340_0081046 Nid, mae'r ffaith yma yn... Lleid, gyda plasfiol, neu blaen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0081046_0082045 Ond mae'r fasiaeth ymgyrchol yn allan i chi gael unrhyw un o'r ffaer o'r ffaer.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082154_0082482 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082589_0083208 No, no, that's the spongy fill would be in the rubber that you put around it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083208_0083491 Ond oedd yna ddaeth i'r cydnabod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083801_0083950 Yeah, I'll do one as well.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0087592_0087662 minimizes
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0090559_0090965 Yeah, I'd go for a five, actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0093454_0093931 Yeah, it was a voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0094276_0094535 Yeah, yeah, that's Facebook.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095126_0095345 I think...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095602_0096244 I think it would probably be a standard. It would be quite loud. It would be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0096244_0096449 And if you didn't
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097153_0097308 Yeah, I won.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097680_0098250 Rwy'n meddwl bod yna ddwy o bobl yn dda iawn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0102290_0102604 Mae'n dda, yn dda.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0114834_0115187 Mae'n dda'r cydnabod ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0115809_0115964 Oh no no no, the um...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116133_0116678 Ie, mae'n... Mae'n rhoi i'r nôl o gynethau cyhoeddus, felly nid oes gwybodaeth.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116802_0117113 In the top, it's the number. Oh, right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0117466_0117955 So would there be two? No, just one rake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118064_0118366 Yeah, one of them and one sample sensor and sample screen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118818_0118949 Ну и там уже.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119293_0119443 too, because it's too noisy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119850_0120257 I'n meddwl y byddai'n dweud y byddai'n dweud...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120464_0120574 One double curve.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120693_0121171 Mae'r un yn ddael.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0121776_0121846 Classy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0122318_0122413 Maybe a little blank on it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0125714_0125931 No, no, that's it's including
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0126045_0126679 Felly dyna ddim yn rhaid bod yn ymwneud â hynny oherwydd dyna ddim yn cymryd yn y cost o'r ffyrdd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0128633_0128764 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0130421_0130825 Yeah, the push buttons one and LC display one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0131134_0131227 But.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0138203_0138312 Let's put this here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139752_0139857 No, it was nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139938_0140207 Mae'n rhaid i chi ddod o'r cyfle i gael gydag.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0140518_0141065 You might be assuming that that is in euros.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141065_0141279 it could be in dollars.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141279_0141927 then we'd be fine because the exchange rate might get better. We haven't been dealing with dollars though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0143648_0144016 Yeah, the standard. It would make one difference.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144016_0144324 The biggest one would be taking away if you took away
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144543_0144579 is
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145099_0145444 If you take away the voice, I don't know what to say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145444_0145718 Os ydych chi'n mynd i'r ffyrdd, yw'r holl ffyrdd, yna mae gennych chi'n...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146347_0146418 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146418_0146869 Where's the voice recognition? It's samples, sense sample speaker.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146869_0147206 Rwy'n gwybod hynny a byddai'n 12.35
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0147540_0148015 Mae'n 3.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150154_0150760 But they, by me, I don't see why we have to sell it for 25 Euros now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150760_0151132 oherwydd roedd yn dweud eisiau bod yn ymwneud â'r bwyd i ddod o bwynt i gyd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0152684_0152856 Mae'n rhaid i ni gyd yn ymwneud â hynny.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0153005_0153128 Yeah, we can say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154713_0154772 Yeah, I mean.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154997_0155203 and then say, we recommend.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0156794_0157060 That's about it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157060_0157389 Yeah, we're close to the budget.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157389_0157688 Is it 12.5?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0163776_0164224 Oherwydd dyna oedd unrhyw bwrdd ar y cyfle, gallwch chi ddod ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0164377_0164535 And we found...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0165505_0165598 So, thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0169504_0169624 I would say it's TV.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0170117_0170307 and find out each other.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173464_0173955 Yeah, no, I thought it went really well.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173955_0174893 Rwy'n credu bod y bobl wedi'i ddod yn ddod, ac mae'r pwyntiau sydd wedi'i ddod yn cael eu gysylltu.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0174893_0175366 Though we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0175366_0176275 Rwy'n credu bod hynny wedi gwneud hynny yn y pryd ymlaen, os oes gennym ni'r ymarferngau, erbyn y cyfleoedd cyffredin.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0176275_0176799 Rwy'n credu efallai byddai'n dod yn unrhyw ffordd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0179518_0179601 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182025_0182333 I can't discuss which ones.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182963_0183503 Rwy'n credu bod ni wedi defnyddio'r system e-mail yn fwy, oherwydd bod ni wedi...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0183706_0184183 oedd o'n bwysig, ac os oeddwn yn ddifynu mwy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0193972_0194451 No one's put any great deal of thought into it. I don't think the companies are really concerned.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194451_0194929 Mae gennym dvd player, a oes unrhyw un yn ei gynrychi?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194929_0195222 Can't you get the one that we used for the last one?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195222_0195447 Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195447_0195953 Mae'n dweud y byddai'n meddwl amdano amdano oherwydd, yn y ffordd, y gysylltiad ymlaen yw'r product y mae'n mynd i'w llysio.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195953_0196277 They're trying to ship the DVD player and video.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0209117_0209327 I think that was just the physical.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0210588_0211064 But you were saying that that's quite, I think in the remand that you were given it was very
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0212327_0212444 Yeah, it was.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213821_0213994 So I'm saying that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213994_0214279 It's a conspiracy going on.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0214279_0214376 Yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0216025_0216367 in my role as project supervisor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0218350_0218423 Müsaade edin.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0220460_0220881 Was that not the question I thought that how you felt you'd done in your
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221156_0221346 ond a oes gennym ni ddod o'r cyfle hwnnw?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221346_0221542 Yeah, there it is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221542_0221919 I think, yeah, question seven was the one I did just before the meeting.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002299_0002344 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002906_0002963 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0009468_0009897 Me and William worked on a prototype and I think William is going to make a presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010362_0010480 I can hold it like this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010605_0010822 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0011596_0011657 Oops.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0012565_0012623 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0013210_0013453 Oh, waar de hengels.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0015304_0015388 It's gonna have a...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0020479_0020798 black and white touch screen yeah yeah it would be so in so
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0027429_0027532 I like every two guys.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033228_0033450 yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033450_0033533 Front
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033648_0034164 Oh right, yeah, okay. So when you need to open here, the same way you've actually got to open it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0035666_0035739 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0039896_0039971 but not interfere.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0040482_0040557 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0042426_0042675 И вот здесь вот
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0044834_0045037 I think this is a good shape.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055079_0055182 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055336_0055621 Is it everybody's going to evaluate or just the ones?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0060095_0060228 Yeah, I see.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0065308_0065495 Ou você for? Eu for.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066323_0066378 on his three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066756_0066816 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0069892_0070123 What does that mean?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070123_0070298 The first one reading, I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070298_0070429 Can you just make it two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070543_0070603 the push.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070603_0070757 Yeah, I just thought it doesn't
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070898_0070995 N-E-E.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0071117_0071242 Yep, I just got it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072069_0072130 to the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072878_0073085 Ich habe hier so eine Schrift, sehr schön, das war es.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080695_0080800 It's so plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080800_0080861 Oh my god.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0082600_0082771 No, no, that's stress.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0083007_0083114 In the rump.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0093601_0093754 Звук
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0107878_0108004 You want me to unblock that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0109655_0109698 That's all.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0115001_0115080 Тихий рот проникаем.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119093_0119208 One level curve.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119371_0119432 Still good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120299_0120367 So just one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120773_0120865 because one another.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122178_0122445 That's T equal to 1 and maybe a little point further.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122756_0123099 Since it's being used just as a casing, we can put 0.5.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123349_0123443 Yeah, cause it'll...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123549_0123800 I think it allows the function.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123800_0123894 You can use that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124252_0124459 Means we are not using a lot of rubber actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124459_0124535 It would be like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124679_0124956 a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0130211_0130272 push button.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137174_0137358 I think you could change the battery also.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137358_0137594 So, going for kinetic, how about going for a standard battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139161_0139263 and good flat
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139789_0139960 It's not calculated.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141567_0141760 We haven't been doing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141989_0142114 I think it's in your room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0143373_0143511 So I'm going to start with the battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144422_0144689 What I feel is customers never said anything about the battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144689_0144939 It's internal, nobody looks into the battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144939_0145209 But shape and curve, that's something we should check out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0145866_0146022 with that special flow.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0146133_0146305 A allwn ni weld beth yw'r ffyrdd yn ei wneud?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0151558_0151753 In our reclination.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157223_0157350 या वेखलुत सुपच
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157501_0157589 Was it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0158800_0158933 to really quibble about him.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160150_0160473 I do not know, but 50 percent is the cost.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160473_0160647 I think the gender one was...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0161295_0161388 I think that is a first one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0162472_0162610 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165317_0165375 Seems fine.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165580_0165807 Excerpt from the mission everything
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0169703_0169821 I think it would be really nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171331_0171714 I think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171714_0172027 it's not like people trying to cut each other
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172027_0172218 it is more of a cohesive teamwork.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172218_0172557 We came to a pretty creative design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172672_0172761 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172892_0172964 Yeah, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172964_0173137 And sir, you coordinated the work very well.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0179596_0179920 That was the best part of that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185416_0185717 Yeah, I didn't like moving around the room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185717_0186263 I think it's good like we spend time individually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0189474_0189743 anyone thought of a remote control with a flip top?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191020_0191204 That's my...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191664_0191739 Yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192004_0192079 But then as she
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192175_0192251 So, thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0199681_0200613 Surprising to me is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every month you see a new launch or something like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0200613_0201118 and new television products coming up but nobody giving much idea to this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0201118_0201302 I think it's really good that this has been
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0210559_0210707 Maybe if people are ending.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0213665_0213719 I can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0215140_0215234 This is a fine cookie.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0216751_0216948 Celebration, you didn't talk about that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005586_0005769 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005769_0006085 I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006200_0006547 and his name and what your function is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006547_0006729 So maybe let's take a look.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0008798_0008859 And your name is?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010788_0010851 Very good.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010851_0011071 And as you already know, I'm Betsy.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011071_0011307 I'm the project manager for today.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011307_0011817 So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012134_0012611 Opening acquaintance tool training wolf
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012611_0013238 The tools, I think we already, I guess the tool is really out of the computer as far as I can see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013287_0013804 Each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013804_0014097 project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014097_0014616 I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014944_0015168 Here is what this thing should be.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015168_0015754 This thing we are going to design is a new remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015754_0016232 should be original, trendy and of course user friendly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0016519_0016699 So maybe I'll make some notes of that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019638_0019744 All right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019744_0020164 Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0020378_0021157 That is, it's going to be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021157_0021820 The same goes for the conceptual design. There will be individual work and then discussion afterwards.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021944_0022212 detailed design. Same thing basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0024394_0024545 Okay, right, what's this thing?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025468_0025736 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025736_0025774 All right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026002_0026470 Then tool training, try out the whiteboard, person can draw their favorite animal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026470_0026872 Does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026872_0027252 so that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027468_0027612 If you want to go, Eileen.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027758_0027986 whether you're without hanging yourself.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0028810_0029082 And remember you have to press so it works.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0030752_0031064 That's a fat cat.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032052_0032258 and you're front scene, right?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032258_0032750 Would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033022_0033083 아, 나 안 하다.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033083_0033153 No, that's okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033357_0033549 I didn't get to that late.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0036725_0037272 is a project finance which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037272_0037593 selling price is supposed to be 25 euro
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037725_0038609 Profit aim for the company is 50 million euro. The market range unlimited meaning international.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0038740_0039364 and production cost should not exceed, hopefully should be less than 1250 euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0040381_0041267 So these are all things of course to remember is a budget and when you design to materials, cost, etc.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0041916_0042758 Now, the discussion, I guess, is does any one of you have experience with remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0042895_0043324 We use them, right? Every day.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043324_0043499 and
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043656_0044399 Now, having used the remote control for years, does anybody already have an idea, things you didn't like with it?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0044399_0044923 things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing, any first ideas?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0045037_0046058 If you like it to be smaller, bigger, have more buttons on it, or maybe clearly better marked buttons, you know, things like that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0046515_0046621 small right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0048672_0049526 So it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051311_0051812 It should be something new. It should do something different than just what we have.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051812_0052107 Now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052422_0052829 Like trendy, you know, like earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052829_0053345 Maybe you should different colors or materials or you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0053345_0053873 So yeah, shapes, right? You know, like kidney shaped feels better in your hand or something, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055123_0055827 That is true, because they put the newspaper or they put it behind a plant or whatever.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055827_0056564 And suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the TV off and say, where the hell is my remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0056614_0057317 Or if it's really in a dark spot that it keeps out a sound or a signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057471_0057593 people are like
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057674_0058145 If lost, signal. Throw a signal, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058567_0058790 Exactly, I mean just that's why I say
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058790_0059260 I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beaver or a light.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060567_0060957 Okay, my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060957_0061646 In other words, if it's in a dark spot, meaning your newspaper is on top.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0061646_0062032 sweater is on top or it's behind a plant.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062032_0062575 At that moment it's like light sensors.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062575_0063003 In that moment it has a center. It gets a certain darkness.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063003_0063476 it has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063476_0063721 I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064129_0064224 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064224_0065078 You know, it would be... Right, you have to have some kind of sensor. And I think voice or clapping, that's not specific enough.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0065078_0065848 I know they are the lamps and stuff, you can clap on and off, but I think they only work to a certain degree.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066408_0066480 what goes with it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066770_0067159 Oh yeah, well, but then those people, we can't help everybody.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0067808_0068395 Okay, we have to move along. Yeah, we have to move along, but I think we have some good points to start with here.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068584_0068849 Okay, the next beating will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068849_0069212 I think you'll... Did you get the notices on your computer for this?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069212_0069545 Okay, so you got the notice.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069545_0070163 The working design, I guess that's the function ID, who is this?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070163_0070398 industrial designer. That's you.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070746_0071113 So we're looking for a working design when we come back.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0071572_0072011 And then the technical function, you are the technical function, so you are the working design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072011_0072439 So you have a working design and then a functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072439_0073430 And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification, like friendliness and what we just discussed in general.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073430_0073594 That would be your idea.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073594_0073824 and of course price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073824_0074169 That's it. That's it. The price is a good price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074169_0074465 I mean the price is given but that was...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074633_0074679 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074944_0075008 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075138_0075610 and you will get specific instructions for that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075610_0075784 I think that's the end of the show.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0076472_0077087 So we have time, two, three minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077087_0077357 Any questions at this point?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077357_0077595 or suggestions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077780_0078716 I think basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions I guess you can...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0079796_0080194 Then we see you in about 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0080194_0080361 and see what we can come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009185_0009269 I'm Janvi.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009269_0010740 I am my role as industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0042869_0043119 We use it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0048170_0048273 temperature inside
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0049278_0049524 machines basically
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0051779_0051874 Now of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0052783_0053265 Maybe different colors or materials.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0053809_0053924 I'm saying you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0057201_0057472 or a signal or something like that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058148_0058588 Maybe it should have a light so that we can just recognize where it is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058588_0058634 Exactly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058700_0058795 That's why I say
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0059086_0059303 light
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0063430_0063763 a beep, I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066398_0066528 What goes with it?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066611_0066715 because you're silly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0068207_0068311 Good points, just a
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0069165_0069233 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0070461_0070773 Yeah, it's functioning. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071171_0071568 Working design, yeah, it's a technical functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071725_0071875 technical functions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079125_0079260 How about you people?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079260_0079395 Yes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079652_0079781 All right, well, let's see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006739_0006909 My name is Franzina.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006909_0007661 and I'm a user interface. My role is the main responsibility is user interface.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0007661_0008083 and my role is to design television remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032223_0032416 Yes, I'm passionate.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032416_0032508 Yes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033158_0033336 No, I can't do it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033747_0033963 I shouldn't.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0034799_0034978 I agree with Leslie.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0035586_0035895 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0045394_0045442 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046146_0046571 Yes, I feel that all the remote should be very compact. Small.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046571_0046979 But those which we get here nowadays, it's very long.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046979_0047276 and it should have multi-purpose.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047276_0047914 like the remote control which we use for TV, it should be used for some other purpose also.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047914_0048673 like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating system.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0048848_0048946 Yes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052105_0052326 Yeah, design should be, yeah, it should be different.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052326_0052544 all the almost all the trend you know like
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052790_0052882 Maybe you should.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0053067_0053246 materials
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057312_0057325 you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057704_0057778 Lost.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057858_0058016 signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0063866_0063918 and other.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0066540_0066638 because you're
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0005725_0005770 I think so.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0006154_0006257 That's a good one.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008339_0008533 and I'm a marketing person.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008533_0008694 I want to figure out how to sell them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008882_0008969 My name is Eileen.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022046_0022155 Same thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022276_0022645 different types of design that we're going to be concerned with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0023611_0023838 Conception, conception.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024101_0024250 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024812_0025104 Maybe we should redesign it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0025279_0025469 After we finish the remote control, we'll get to that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027623_0027852 Okay, I'll see what I can do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027852_0027889 We have
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0028008_0028551 See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029006_0029219 So that's what I want to do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029219_0029775 Um... um... traditional...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0030798_0031573 That's a fat cat. That's a very fat cat.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0031573_0031812 And it likes to sit like that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0032877_0033282 Am I supposed to wipe off that? No, no, no, that's okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035732_0035806 아, OK.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035999_0036482 The kitty cat is hungry because it all likes things.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0039523_0039851 Okay, that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0040286_0040648 So these are all things of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0049614_0050276 1250 euros per...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050378_0050675 Well, who knows if we get a really good site or maybe we can do that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050780_0051357 We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things. It should be
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0051736_0051776 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0053853_0054232 Friendly shape. That would help.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0054232_0055025 I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap. Because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0055025_0055113 They can't find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0056602_0056712 Well, or, yeah, or you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0057264_0057676 So either beef or a light should blink.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0058039_0058091 signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0059225_0060571 I think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond... What should you have to do to make it beep or blink?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0062554_0062623 Okay
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0063909_0064125 the light sensor would activate the signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0065819_0066177 But it could be some place really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066522_0066689 Because you're silly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066689_0066793 because people are so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066866_0067777 and those people, we can't help everybody. Well, if we're like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table, um...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0067777_0067999 Maybe we have to move along.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0074525_0074986 We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0078758_0079163 I think I have enough to think about until our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079163_0079283 How about you people?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079650_0079774 All right, well.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0080380_0080453 Okay, very good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0003732_0003865 Okay, is everybody ready?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0004717_0005869 I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0006079_0006733 I think the marketing manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0007843_0007903 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0009559_0009705 participant for
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010096_0010373 Ok.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010629_0010753 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034130_0034686 one other appliance or maybe a lamp. Can I at this point interject something?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034686_0035355 We have received instructions from higher up that certain things should not be considered.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0035355_0036262 The one thing for example, something to eliminate maybe, that's the teletext because that's sort of outdated.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0036262_0037062 And according to higher management, it should only control the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0037062_0038107 Mostly because they feel that it's too complex a task to include other things and they're concerned with the time to market.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0038285_0039112 And the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039112_0039508 and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039508_0040221 so that it's easy, that they can be easily identified as a product of the company.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040221_0040704 and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who's bringing this up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040704_0041353 So I just wanted to check this here so we're not getting too much off track here with the things we want to look at.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041353_0041995 These were instructions from higher up, so we have to eliminate these things. So it's only going to be TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041995_0042510 But the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0042638_0042729 Okay, all right
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056303_0056460 And oh...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056599_0057157 Who would be next? I guess that would be you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0057229_0057449 You want me to do get your smile and show up?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058082_0058319 And you are number 3, number 2.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058319_0058366 Namaste.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060454_0060526 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060798_0060871 That's it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0071692_0072250 That's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0083585_0084194 I think it's possible. Yeah, well, that has been eliminated. So that's a good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0085700_0085744 아, 진짜요?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086748 You could just build a wall basically.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086928_0087468 There's a budget we're looking at if you build one more that's going to make a big difference whether it's going to be square or...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088357_0088405 Oh yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088531_0089146 I think we'll have to look at the budget on that, but I think in principle that would be kind of fun.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089146_0089183 because we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089549_0089661 Silly food. Silly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089733_0089875 Like a 90s-
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096671_0096935 A little elderly, a little arthritic hand, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096935_0097875 and it's a small button and they don't press it exactly, you know, something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0100099_0100191 get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102284_0102486 Because the clock could be really fast.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102808_0103154 You see the same thing on the radio.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0108556_0108634 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0111613_0111738 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0115161_0115274 Oh, you don't have to.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0117944_0117979 this one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0119741_0119918 And...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120040_0120160 You are two.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120306_0120341 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0121071_0121245 Would you want it full speed?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0127901_0128111 on the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0128111_0128168 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0130485_0130598 If I were upset in any way
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0149375_0149515 Timer, yeah. Timer.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0150288_0150602 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0153384_0154275 On my slideshow, basically we have already done the agenda and on the closing, basically there would be lunch break and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0154275_0155070 However, the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155070_0155734 and what function working design, how does it work?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155734_0156064 So these are the two things we should come up with.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0156064_0156654 So the first thing is maybe a little easier on the who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157093_0157263 I guess in many ways everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157448_0157621 Everybody who has a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157798_0158314 Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158314_0158496 There are a few, but in general not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158673_0159520 Now, talking about the target group, which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0159520_0160519 We have earlier, it was mentioned about, for example, elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160519_0160975 So I think that's one group that's certainly important.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160975_0161845 Then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0161845_0162455 and I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0162455_0163223 I mean that's a question, whether that's important that children can really use it or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163447_0163714 So these are just some thoughts I have on it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163714_0165367 And I don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're going to design this one thing. Or whether we're looking at what we like, we're talking about different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0165367_0166225 Whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0167876_0168847 a lot of marketing pull. That has a lot of appeal, but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it, whether we're looking at different groups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0168847_0169322 I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors. That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0169322_0170178 You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent banana color or whatever. You know? You make a banana shaped one. Yeah. For example, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170178_0170467 But the question is really who is our target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170623_0170867 Do we look at one target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170984_0172090 And with the 25 euros, you know, can we afford to have, I'm asking the technical people here whether to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0172297_0172966 sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group, how much would that throw us
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0173074_0173490 out of the cost we are supposed to respect.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0175538_0175628 With
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0176298_0176399 Well, that's good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0179785_0180380 The question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0180380_0181272 And I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons, you know, within the target group or subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0181272_0182218 The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182218_0182431 I mean the basic design that you understand will be the same.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182431_0183428 But the question is how much will that set us back if let's say 40% we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0183533_0184353 So that remains to be seen, but the target group as a whole is basically everybody who is a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0185553_0185747 Yeah, well that's the question.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0186847_0187426 Well, maybe there's an idea, you know, for example, new portable phones.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187426_0187816 They have removable plastic cases.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187816_0188477 So you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0188477_0190040 that in each package you have, for example, you have, let's say, a fluorescent blue on it, but then you have another color or stripe, whatever, that already comes in a package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190040_0190371 And then if people really want more colors, they can buy it separately.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190507_0190650 mobile phones we have.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190927_0190982 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190982_0191694 But like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe, whatever they have as another one in the package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0191694_0192696 and they can go to the store for a few francs or euros, whatever, they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it, for example.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0194549_0196111 Well, I think the idea here is to design one remote and the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics, if you want to put it that way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0196111_0197066 having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197287_0197556 Five minutes, I guess that's the old message.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197828_0197944 Finish me now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197944_0198241 Um...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0198892_0199452 But I think we do some more research. I think to sum it up, the target group is basically everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0199452_0200023 If money permits, we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200145_0200247 I think we should be.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200474_0201028 Do we agree on that in principle? Like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201207_0201447 So now I understand it's lunch break.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201548_0201631 And um...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201778_0201922 So that's what we will do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202220_0202324 So thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202439_0202690 And we'll see you after lunch.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0011039_0011117 concrete.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0026483_0026554 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0037439_0037582 to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057119_0057188 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057335_0057454 Yeah, sure.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057454_0057498 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0058247_0058379 Number 2
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059092_0059158 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059376_0059594 Can you get a food screen please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059841_0060125 No, that's like, you have to press here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060245_0060521 Kap. Kap, przypij.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060521_0060592 Tote, tote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060771_0060994 So to be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060994_0061373 I am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061373_0061644 Can I go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061832_0062592 The method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0062592_0063941 It takes the power from a battery, say a battery, it can't be an electric supply like you have to like switch connect your remote controller to a power supply from the electricity or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0063941_0066293 it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you should take it to wherever you want and then this integrated circuit it takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into infrared bits and it sends it to the device
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066293_0066601 like a TV or air conditioner, something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066643_0067027 A remote controller is specifically designed to a single device.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0067027_0068629 if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0068629_0070147 it should recognize the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote controller will send a signal
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070147_0070757 and the TV it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070757_0071600 change the volume control and so I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0071851_0071905 management.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0072628_0073653 So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user interface like a switch pad or something like that, buttons should be there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073653_0073867 So you can control whatever you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073867_0076040 you want to change the channel, you want to control the volume, you want to mute the TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations, there should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and TV can perform the actions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076111_0076315 So can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076382_0077721 I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller. I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much of the investment also.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0077721_0079412 it's like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller, those we can make like fluorescent, they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0079506_0081211 and there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed. If suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time, then there should be a beep saying that this is not an action.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081211_0081515 there can be no action taken to that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081515_0081690 and there should be a child lock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081690_0083182 like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like if you have kids and all then they will be playing with remote controllers so you can lock the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0083182_0084080 make it usable for more than one device. It's hard but I think it's possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084080_0084245 Yeah, youth poetry.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084245_0085364 and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and so that's good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0085488_0085806 and colors also.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086009_0086577 No, no, I don't think it will be like you can have you know for if you want pictures that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086627_0086683 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086683_0086926 It's just a shape, so it doesn't matter.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088300_0088570 Yeah, that is also possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088713_0088792 Yeah, that's about it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089120_0089205 Because we had
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089635_0089884 for children like an animal
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089884_0090028 Or a little...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090210_0090371 It's not innocent.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090440_0091106 and the buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091106_0091392 If there are more buttons, then it will be more complicated.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091392_0091748 If you have less features, then your remote controller won't be attractive.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091748_0092561 So I think we need to make some buttons which are intended for two or three operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0092561_0093299 like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press the other button in another mode it will change the color
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0093299_0093901 So if you want to have less buttons, we can have that option, but I think it will complicate the matter more, I think so.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0094196_0094311 with the user interface.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0095879_0096045 I mean you and I
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0096256_0096337 time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0097647_0097780 anything else in the day.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0098176_0098450 You don't feel the mood change.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099002_0099208 Yeah, shapes also different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099208_0099290 a triangle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100079_0100646 But we'll get to that with you. And also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguities. That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100706_0100788 That's a good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100893_0102201 And display clock, if you want more features then we can display a clock. I don't think it will take any money, extra money, because I think if we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102313_0102440 because the clock could be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102753_0103119 And then you see the same one and you maybe have no other...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0103811_0104056 Can you go to the next, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104056_0104880 components the main components may need for it like buttons and underneath that there should be switch
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104880_0105030 and bulbs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105030_0105851 like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating the remote controller or whenever the TV is on suppose
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105851_0106265 then the remote controller should automatically have a light.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106384_0106796 then it will be like if you switch on your TV through another source.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106796_0107456 not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107456_0107578 Maybe we can have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107578_0107880 Whenever the TV is on, remote controller will have a light.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108020_0108277 and then inflow red bulbs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108277_0108576 This is like when it is dark.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108668_0109143 and battery, there should be a battery for power supply and a chip
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109143_0109521 which is like a brain to the control which does all the operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109521_0110074 and voice connecting all chips which is lights everything so there should be wires.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110167_0110652 And of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110652_0111183 you know, different shapes or whatever it is, there should be a case to give a shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0111509_0111579 Hål upp.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112017_0112192 I'm going to do this.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112286_0112464 Next slide please.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112611_0113850 I have referred the site the home page of the website from where I have I got few points
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0114021_0114147 That's it. That's it from me now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115275_0115370 It's not like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115370_0116172 I have referred the page to get new ideas of what can be the working design, how it works and all.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116450_0116514 if you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116568_0116646 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0117636_0117926 It's actually been on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137491_0137642 вот так
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137642_0137890 If there is a clot, then there can be an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0149124_0149678 later and use it. Okay it's like a timer. Timer. Yeah and then you can use it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0157482_0157685 who has a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0158170_0158348 don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0175767_0176417 We can design different remotes for different people, like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0176666_0176809 and a middle edge.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177578_0177728 Yeah, of course, that we can do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177728_0179020 but specifically if elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big remote controller for elderly and for children.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179020_0179123 What about the electronics?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179295_0179446 It doesn't close.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179728_0179872 Doesn't matter.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186614_0186661 years and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186661_0186947 industrial person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186947_0187015 There's an idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0190462_0191133 like you know mobile phones we have different you know covers that's right but like if then everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0194588_0194668 I think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198668_0198931 to our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198931_0199144 I think to say that the problem is that the problem is that the problem is that the problem
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200029_0200753 Do we agree on that in principle?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200825_0200991 whether we will be able to do that on
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0202280_0202326 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0026925_0026998 Somebody take a
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0027570_0027685 silver sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0071586_0071643 the police.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0085727_0085777 que se
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0086714_0086806 It's just...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0089813_0089969 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0097699_0097754 and they have a
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0102334_0102375 because the
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111068_0111184 I'll just keep the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111410_0111519 Please hold on.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111519_0111649 Håller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0119903_0119972 to spend
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0120208_0120273 No, no, I'm three.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121036_0121146 Would you want it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121146_0121371 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121442_0122422 As a user interface designer, I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122422_0122697 Can you please go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122697_0123822 So I found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance, at remote distance.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0123988_0124081 Now for that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0124081_0125332 A remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the TV and it can control the functionalities, different functionalities of the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0125332_0126793 There should be a signal, something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television. If the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume, he can change it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0126978_0127965 Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user choice.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128388_0128951 If you want to view a particular program at say 9 o'clock, he can set the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128951_0129389 and the TV will automatically switch on at that particular time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0129389_0130658 So he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular child at a certain age.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0130658_0131316 then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0131316_0132153 and one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0132383_0133347 The remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV, television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0133347_0134209 and this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T, an alphabet for more compactability.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134353_0134816 and there is one more point which I noted it down.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134816_0135989 like the material which is used for remote should be human friendly. It should not cause any skin disease or something, some allergy to either children or to an adult person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0135989_0137124 and it should have an alarm clock. A person if somebody wants to get up at around 8pm and you can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137124_0137523 And I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137830_0138232 जानवी कहा था प्राइजावाद प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लिए प्राइजावाद के लि
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0138232_0139184 We can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons. So different buttons will glow differently.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139184_0139773 So even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139914_0140886 and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0140886_0141138 वो अच्छाना पर पाइजाए नहीं पर पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइजाए नहीं पाइ
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0141528_0142412 and findings. I found out on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0142412_0143443 There are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities. There are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions. And there are
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0143608_0144513 So you have different types of remotes with different light source which I use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of the television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145325_0145407 Nix.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145632_0146151 and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for the multipurpose use
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0146201_0147193 no like it can it can be used as a TV control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing and it should have a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147193_0147988 and then to save electricity there should not be much more lots of circuits and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147988_0148961 And if a person, if parents wants the television to be switched off by 10 o'clock, then it should be switched off at 10 o'clock automatically.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0148961_0149228 so that nobody else comes later and use it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0149547_0149771 Yeah, and then you can use a timer as well.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0150148_0150198 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0157657_0157792 TV television movies.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0169295_0169374 You know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0173696_0175737 Generally, we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from 10 to 40. Then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people who have nervous problems.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0176300_0177029 In a family there will be an aged person, children and a middle aged person but they cannot buy three different remotes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0177029_0177625 They would like to buy just one, which can be used by all the three.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0179221_0179323 How much is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0192775_0194536 But yeah, I have a doubt like will it be cost twice effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0195575_0195659 오케이
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0199939_0200079 within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0003972_0004279 Just put on the microphone here and we'll be right with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007539_0007703 Okay, you want me to start right now?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007998_0008644 Could you put my slides up because I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009682_0009830 4% 4, I believe.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009830_0009886 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010847_0010963 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010963_0011958 Okay, well, I think we've introduced ourselves, so the functional requirements is part of my goal, but why don't we pass right to the second slide.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012069_0012334 That's where my discussion starts.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012334_0013030 Well, since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013030_0013619 I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013619_0014672 And the reason I just put that there like that is that in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0014672_0015069 You can say anything you want. No matter how silly it sounds, you know, you can run your car.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0015069_0016531 It should heat up your motor. It should turn on your seating or whatever you want it to do. And then as we go on, what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0016562_0017633 So I'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's going to be to add a feature or how expensive it's going to be or if your time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0017633_0018011 It takes five years to develop this. It's just something we can't do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018011_0018921 So in the beginning, just have a big puddle of things that we, anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018921_0019778 And then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer, we'll try to then prioritize those.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0019778_0020047 So that was what I meant there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020047_0020887 And as I said on the slide there, consulting the industrial engineer about that. And the other thing is timing is really going to be as important as money.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020887_0021322 because if we're going to sell this thing, I think the best time to sell this is Christmas present.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021364_0021801 25 euros, makes a nice little present. And we want it to be an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021801_0022222 We want somebody to see it, and I think it's, I just gotta have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022222_0022406 and take out their wallet and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022406_0022828 So it's going to be really attractive, but it's got to go to market by September.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022828_0023485 because anything that you don't have already out there in September showing it around isn't going to sell for Christmas.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0023485_0026102 And then I'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color. And I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026131_0026563 So, you're coming to you for how much is it gonna cost and how long is it gonna take you?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026563_0027101 and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's going to make somebody take out their wallet, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027101_0027851 what's going to really be what they call the sizzle, because we've got to sell the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027851_0029054 A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just going to take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029054_0029206 Okay, can we go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029486_0030625 I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at, the whole house idea really isn't going to be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0030625_0031175 So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we could suggest anything.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031175_0031708 I'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031708_0032924 not something like whole house control. And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0032924_0033501 at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work, the TV, the VCR,
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0033501_0034381 the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034381_0034459 at this point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034568_0034638 something
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038132_0038212 Of course.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038308_0038440 Okay, so it's over.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0041820_0041895 I'm only going to be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042700_0042838 Alright, thanks for that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042838_0043738 All right, now other things that I found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0043738_0044093 because a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044093_0044900 And that was 34% of even more important, the thing that we did address in our last meeting, that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044900_0045388 So those are two things that we definitely do want to address.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0045388_0046099 We want to make it as simple as possible. We want to make it obvious and intuitive to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0046099_0047160 And then the things about finding it, we talked about a light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047160_0047734 And I think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047734_0047873 Can we go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047965_0048737 Okay, so my personal preferences in this project are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0048737_0049169 That is the selling point, the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049169_0049802 Because once there's no be back, well in sales they always say, be back, still come back.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049802_0050107 If somebody says, oh, I'll come back and get it next week, you're dead.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050107_0050250 They're never gonna come back and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050250_0050983 You've got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now, now, now. Now is a big word in my book for selling this thing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051054_0051832 And in order to make it really saleable, we've got to shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051832_0052603 We have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion. So that's why I'm saying simplicity is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052603_0052895 Finding it's important obviously. You can't use it if you can't find it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052895_0053566 So you've got to concentrate on the features that help you find it. And I've already said this several times, but I put it down in writing here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053566_0053911 there should be an attractive impulse purchase at 25 euros.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053911_0054476 So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say, ah, 25 euros, I'm not going to take that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054476_0054921 has to be so great that they're gonna say, oh, 25 euros isn't much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054921_0055696 And then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0055696_0055895 Okay, that's about it for me right now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0071650_0072292 Yeah, well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0075399_0075459 the integrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0083710_0083926 That has been it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085300_0085700 That's good for marketing. Fun shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085700_0085982 You say that won't add too much to the budget?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085982_0086172 No, no, I don't think it's...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0087557_0088267 Do you think there's any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088416_0088504 That can be a good thing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088504_0088682 because that might help with the marketing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0089144_0090328 Because we had something sort of sexy for adults. We could have something sort of silly for children, or a little animal shape, or a little elephant so they can remember where it is.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0093904_0094930 I think that's something that we'll have to discuss with the user interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0094930_0095705 I think one of the things people were complaining about when I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0095705_0096316 the changing modes was something... I mean you and I, all four of us, we work with computers all the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096316_0096672 changing modes is nothing for us, but people who
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096845_0096954 You know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0097752_0098520 It's the kind of thing people learn by feel. You don't feel the mood change.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0098520_0099118 So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be helpful. Yeah, shapes are also different.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0099118_0100076 You know, like a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100076_0100251 But we'll get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100587_0100676 That's right, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100676_0100766 No, that's a good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0102143_0102905 Yeah, that's a good one because the clock could be really friendly. When is your favorite show coming on?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103084_0103293 Yeah, a lot of times there's not a clock on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103293_0103559 then you have to go somewhere, but you just want to look at the news for a minute.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103559_0103774 Yeah, that's good. The clock is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0114715_0115075 So we should visit this site and have a look at what's up there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116205_0116375 So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116540_0116634 Okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0117284_0117607 Did you go back to that slide where she had that sight up?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0118011_0118110 Yeah, okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0135833_0135885 But it's
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0137802_0138030 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166276_0166737 Well, you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166737_0168094 So if you design something that's very attractive to children, the mommy please mommy please, you know, we want it now, we want to go to the store and see it. That has a lot of marketing pull.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169274_0169314 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169762_0169980 We'll make a banana shaped one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179007_0179132 What about the electronics?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179132_0179323 That's not really going to change much, is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179406_0179688 That won't change much, will it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179808_0179911 The question
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0184362_0185216 That's right. And can we, is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185216_0185658 Or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185658_0186120 the same electronics and basically all that's going to be different is the plastic case.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186120_0186575 and in that case we could probably molded plastic isn't all that expensive, is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186575_0186754 You're an industrial person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0188725_0188880 There's a real idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0191056_0191112 If they're never
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0192228_0192322 an alternate package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0194615_0194841 Saya rasa idea di sini adalah untuk membuat keputusan.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0197756_0197905 I'm waiting for the next meeting to happen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0198506_0198918 Well, we may have to come back to our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0200114_0200201 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0201029_0201159 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004216_0004299 Hello, everyone.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004479_0004718 How are we doing?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004927_0005625 First we're going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0005625_0006870 In the last meeting, the marketing manager had presented her method of working, meaning gathering suggestions.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0006997_0007904 from everyone to see how she best could market this product within the budget that was given.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008138_0008820 In general, the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008975_0009457 It's also an item that people lose a lot.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009457_0009814 So we should address that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009814_0010097 And of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010196_0010416 that is very simple to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010556_0011343 In addition to that, to make it sell, of course, the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011343_0011676 or like she says, put some sizzle into it in one way or another.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011777_0012321 so that people are buying it now because in particularly smaller items.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0012321_0013004 that's a very important fact because if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013079_0013750 Also mentioned was it should have a very short learning curve.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013868_0014315 and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0014486_0015156 Our technical manager has then said that he feels it should have a chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0015303_0016034 that has infrared bits and has an interface that controls the chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016141_0016636 Therefore, messages will be controlled in the same manner.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016636_0017055 There should be extra features like lit buttons, maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017055_0017265 if too many buttons are pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017385_0018387 child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018493_0018818 You could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018818_0019144 also mentioned was maybe different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0019338_0020355 So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infrared bulbs, battery, chips, wires and maybe some kind of a holder.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0020468_0020854 for the for the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0021026_0022213 Francina, who is our interface designer, has mentioned that the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0022213_0022856 of course you'd have an on off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it would have maybe a channel lock
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023009_0023561 particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't watch a channel that is undesirable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023561_0023683 It should be compact.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023683_0024093 her personal favorite was it should be t-shaped.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024093_0024326 and maybe having an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024326_0024794 and the material should possibly be of non-allergic nature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025022_0025699 The different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025804_0026480 maybe it should have electricity saving feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0026583_0027722 and even possibly a timer so that people can program their favorite program right from the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0027908_0028452 Are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Yes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0028659_0029094 Okay, then we are looking for three presentations
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0029094_0029975 And I don't know whether the order matters much. I don't think so. So whoever wants it. I can start first. Yeah. OK.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0030610_0030733 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0031419_0031552 I'm sorry.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0032145_0032361 And that's number two, right?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037338_0037392 9 or
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037392_0037633 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037796_0037911 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037911_0037995 Yes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071148_0071367 Okay, thank you very much
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071367_0071681 Any comments on her presentation?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074229_0074411 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074936_0075179 No, I think these are her presentations.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0075179_0076320 But as far as the decision making, we can come back to that later. But I just wanted to know whether anybody had anything to add to her presentation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076418_0076442 I'm not sure.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076735_0076947 Who wants to go next?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077090_0077226 Okay
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077711_0077778 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0078760_0078872 or components design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0098452_0098489 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130408_0130522 And you have more pictures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130522_0130739 We have five minutes to the end of the meeting.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134033_0134113 Okay, well thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134248_0134577 Any particular comments by anybody?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0137498_0138269 We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her. Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0138383_0138486 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0151820_0152029 Uh, that's...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152200_0152485 concludes the presentation of everyone.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152485_0153203 And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0153362_0154015 And so what do we think on the concept?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0154112_0154194 of the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0156370_0156455 That could be our
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0158654_0158929 Well, you teach, you have to teach.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0161998_0162607 Okay, before we get too far off here, the components of the concept is the energy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0162607_0162897 What kind of energy do we foresee?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0163699_0163926 Okay then chip on print
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164176_0164267 and the case.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164267_0164756 And I think we all agree on the case, we want to have something maybe bright, colourful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0165479_0165739 Very design, compact and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166028_0166645 user interface concept interface type supplements
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166960_0167250 I will pee your area.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0167951_0168227 push buttons. I guess for yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0168722_0168921 I'm not sure what they mean by supplements.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169317_0169382 like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169701_0169802 speech recognition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169802_0169923 Right, right, right.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171259_0171654 Our next meeting will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171654_0172685 and the idea is to, this is the individual actions to be taken until then, to have the look and feel designed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0172871_0173724 And the UID is supposed to come up with the user interface design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0173847_0174301 and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0174301_0175288 In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay. It says here.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175288_0175809 You will receive specific instructions. Will be sent to you by your coaches.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175954_0177111 If you have any questions, you can always contact me or your coach, I suppose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0177327_0178398 So I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in 30 minutes according to our time table.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0178752_0178832 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0004829_0004877 Good?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0040287_0040407 good.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077014_0077070 Maybe.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077209_0077282 discipline
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077830_0078010 the next one. Oops
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0078010_0078122 It was the war.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0079698_0080715 This time I am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0080715_0080945 Can you go on to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081013_0081722 I have just briefed down a few components which we require for the remote control construction.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081722_0082429 The first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery. It's a fact that right it's like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082452_0082974 It can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong and
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082974_0083549 even if you just, you know, if it falls down then it doesn't break.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083549_0083753 so it should be strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083753_0084199 and there are no harmful materials used in that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084199_0084349 and it should be recyclable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084523_0085230 And also using of coloring compounds like if we want to have different colors
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085230_0085823 blue red green so we have to use some coloring component compounds
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085884_0086444 And the second important thing is integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0086444_0087057 we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087057_0087957 if it is not efficient then everything is going to be like less efficient so we should have a highly sophisticated one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087957_0088348 and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088348_0088688 Suppose if it is 38 degrees outside, 40 degrees outside,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088688_0089579 it should be able to resist the high temperature and low temperatures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0089579_0090048 and it should be equipped with timer and alarm facility.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0090140_0092106 And the other component we have in the remote controller is a resistor, which is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller. And also a capacitor, which I think is like a battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092199_0092360 Can you go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092605_0093019 a diode, a transistor, a resonator.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093019_0093692 These are all the technical electronic components which we have to use in a remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093692_0094109 a battery I would like to suggest one thing if we
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0094162_0095016 If we will be able to make a rechargeable battery, then we need not go for a high-performance battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095016_0095434 Even if it is a low performance battery, it can't charge much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095434_0095628 It's not a high voltage battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095628_0096094 and also we can, if it is a rechargeable one, then people can use it for a long time.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096094_0096748 So in that way we can cut the cost but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096832_0097215 and we have a circuit board in a remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097215_0097446 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097446_0097754 and how it works, how the remote controller works.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097754_0097852 when you press a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098639_0098714 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098714_0098982 when you press a button, when you do that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098982_0099792 you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a small circuit underneath the button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0099792_0100604 and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0100604_0101397 Suppose you have pressed channel 1 button, number 1 you have pressed, then the chip will know that the number 1 button was pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101397_0101770 it produces a more score line signal specific to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101828_0102181 Every button, every individual button has its own more school.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0102181_0103151 suppose the user has pressed button 1 then it will have a specific, the circuit will generate a specific Morse code to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103151_0103896 and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the LED which translates the signal into infrared light.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103896_0104247 Like you have got a signal by pressing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104247_0104633 that Morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104690_0105088 Now that signal that MOSCUT has to be amplified by the transistor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105088_0105449 that is the use of transistor which we use in the remote control unit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105449_0106205 It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the LED and which translates the signal into infrared bits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106205_0106914 the sensor in the TV can see the infrared light and seeing the signal, it reacts appropriately.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106914_0107871 that when it sees the amplified Morse code signal then it will know what action it has to do.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0107871_0108100 then it will do the appropriate action.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108100_0108406 So this is how the remote controller works.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108608_0108739 Can you go to the next leg?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108818_0108950 Yeah, I have few pictures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108950_0109602 when you look at the remote controller, this is a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109602_0109775 And to the next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109916_0110176 and we had a few buttons and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110176_0110781 And if you open the remote controller, you have this circuit board and few electronic components.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110781_0111206 like you can see a chip there which is having 18 pins.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0111206_0112252 and also a capacitor, three resistors and also resonator and the diode transistor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0112409_0113165 the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode transistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0113411_0114156 Yeah, you can see the TA11835 labeled chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114274_0114940 You can also see the green, two green things are, they are resistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114940_0115695 and just beside that you can see a transistor and a cylinder shape that one is a capacitor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0115695_0116236 and also there are resistors, sorry, there is a diode.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116236_0116386 Can you go on to the next?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116498_0116663 So this is the circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116663_0116861 The green one is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116861_0117506 Actually building a circuit board is pretty easy and also it's inexpensive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117506_0117850 it costs less than what you print on a paper.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117850_0118489 because when you are building some circuits and also wires
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0118489_0119311 It's better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a bulk and it's just printing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119311_0119607 nothing like you know you don't need to use wires and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119607_0119842 it's not exactly wires we are using.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119842_0120132 It's just printing something on a board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120132_0120531 those prints will act as wires and circuits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120671_0120979 So that green thing is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120979_0121709 and also you can see there are like access for buttons like when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0121709_0122749 the circuit under the button will be activated it will get some signals from it and it will send the signals to the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122749_0122929 integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122929_0123067 and good things.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123124_0123528 So these are the circuits underneath the buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123528_0123781 Can you see the black round marks?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123781_0123904 They are the circuits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123998_0124113 next piece.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0124113_0125076 and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0125076_0126004 But a push button requires a simple chip underneath it. But whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip, which is a higher price range.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126004_0126666 Like for schools we have to go for a sophisticated and full complete chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126666_0127306 And as an energy source we offer a basic battery, more engineers, a hard dynamo.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127306_0127968 a kinetic provision of energy, modern watches that you shake casually to provide energy
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127968_0128534 So that also we can have in a battery. Or we can use solar cells.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0128993_0129358 Yeah, the product can be delivered into different cases.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0129358_0130124 Usually the case is uncut flat that we see usually a normal remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0130672_0131029 Yeah, maybe I have just one more slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131214_0131805 like we can have a material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium but titanium we can't use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131805_0132583 and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the print.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132583_0132975 also includes the infrared sender
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132975_0133592 And for the movie just develop a sample speaker.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133716_0133830 Yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133922_0134042 It's awful, you know.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135352_0135967 No, no, no. The scrolling was different. Like you can go for switches like buttons or scrolls.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135967_0136326 which we used to do before, 10 years before I think.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136326_0136783 Now nobody uses it because you need a sophisticated chip and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136783_0137172 So I think it's better we go for ordinary buttons. We'll just go for buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0137172_0137325 Yeah, I use push buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0155951_0155980 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0156682_0157287 I agree with that. But I'm very much doubtful how far it will work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157287_0157809 because speech recognizer has its own distance problem.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157856_0158196 Yeah, it's not distance problem. It's recognizing a person's voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158196_0158744 like maybe different people will be having different voices so like everything.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158875_0159324 So to get a good recognizing system it's a cost-taking.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0160727_0160814 Yeah, but obvious.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0164914_0165021 Oh, trendy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0165087_0165205 and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167428_0167885 like switches, like we use buttons for user interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167992_0168050 push buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0169896_0169937 Mm-hmm.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0178831_0178919 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0021374_0021488 Interface design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0029733_0029926 Whoever wants it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0030545_0030674 Can I have my slate please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0032580_0032667 I practice being three.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0033756_0034196 As an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034196_0034711 how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034904_0035003 next piece
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035170_0035689 Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035689_0036777 This messages could be switch on off message, switch to next channel message, swapping the channels, switching on to a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0036777_0037125 like you can have the numbers 1 2 3 4 up to 9.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037733_0037769 Pardon me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037914_0038091 Yes, nine numbers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0038297_0039313 And then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0039580_0040685 then you should have a next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0040685_0040793 Next slide please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041040_0041593 then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041810_0042459 then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0042459_0043076 For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have subtitles in English.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0043076_0043969 then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044193_0044767 then there should be some buttons which can control features like the color
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044767_0045303 color of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0045677_0045873 Now there should be a memory switch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046272_0046472 There should be a mute button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046472_0047301 Suddenly if a viewer gets a telephone call and if he doesn't want to switch off the TV,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0047301_0048236 but he can reduce the sound, he can bring the volume down and he can watch while talking he can watch the TV.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0048236_0048884 Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049045_0049572 It's an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049852_0050709 So remote can be can be designed which can have the voice recognizers. You can record your own voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051039_0051517 which can be recognised by a voice recogniser in the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051517_0052189 If you want to see the 9th channel, if you say just say 9th channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052189_0052811 The remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052811_0053586 So the TV will have some recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0053586_0053930 So this is one of the very important features a remote control can have.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054117_0054527 So this is one of the interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054720_0055229 a very simple interface which has all the important features.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055337_0055442 Please, next side.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055573_0056263 These are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056263_0056861 Sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056861_0057360 So you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057360_0057596 even a kid can use that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057596_0057810 So can you go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057900_0058505 Yeah. So this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0058505_0059282 and this has multi-purpose use. It can be used for TV, it can be used for cable satellites, it can be used for VCR, DVDs and audio.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0059519_0059766 and this has inbuilt voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060165_0060335 Rwy'n mynd i'r ddau.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060335_0061014 Yeah, now this is an interface for a remote which a child can use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061014_0061664 This is user friendly, it's very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061664_0062022 and this comes with different colors, different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0062692_0063723 and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0063815_0064076 Attractive Child Interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064655_0064779 Excellent, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064779_0065694 Now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066114_0066729 I could use that in a minute. No, this is a very biggie, can I? Let's place it anywhere.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066729_0067250 So this is the jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to misplace or lose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067389_0067648 This is one such interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067837_0068986 And the personal preference would be to incorporate speech recognizers which will respond to user's voice for a particular function.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0069197_0069294 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0072873_0072896 아, 너무 귀엽다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0075564_0075593 weekend.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0108382_0108416 the next.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0113958_0114005 Oh, so.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0137241_0137310 for you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0154766_0155184 Yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0155994_0156254 This could be one feature which could be celebrated.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159121_0159844 No, it's like you are recording a question already.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159844_0160229 and then you're expecting an answer from, for example, you have a TV system.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160229_0160992 I am the user and my family members are the user. I will already record a question like
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160992_0161438 Good morning, like around 8 o'clock I want to see the news in the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161438_0161756 So I'll say just good morning and the TV will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161756_0162029 It will recognize my voice and it will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0164881_0164970 for
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0165119_0165290 and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0167885_0167954 push buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0168978_0169657 different types of features buttons yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0178837_0178885 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0028468_0028599 Okay, I got pretty much the same.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065632_0065748 You don't know me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065748_0066286 I could lose that in a minute.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072037_0072494 Well, looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072494_0072892 No suggestion is bad.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072892_0073178 but we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0073178_0074006 I don't think that we can get the T shape is good, the child one is good. Is it too big to misplace? I think it's just funny.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074006_0074814 I don't think that's going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074814_0075047 It's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075159_0075207 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075476_0075617 have to come back to that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0076254_0076643 No, I think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0084611_0084654 Good point.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0128530_0128654 That's interesting.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0134648_0135275 On the scroll and the push button, you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0137109_0137442 We'll just go for push buttons in the interest of cost.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138188_0138348 We'll go right to my next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138641_0139591 All right, my method is I'm interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0139591_0140222 So I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140222_0140793 I spend a lot of time on the internet, surfing around, doing the same thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140793_0141346 And then when I'm out in people's houses or meetings or anything like that,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141346_0141886 I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141886_0142148 and I would encourage you all to do the same.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142148_0142685 And my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142685_0143016 People like something that really fits in their hand.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143016_0143144 Simple is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143144_0143839 They don't want to have to squint at small print. They want buttons whose functions are obvious.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143839_0144355 and they want as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144355_0144558 They want each button to do something.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144558_0144676 And eye catching is important.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144676_0144923 It's gotta look cute, it's gotta look appealing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144923_0145145 Go ahead, I'm trying to finish fast for you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145145_0145782 And our preference is as far as I'm concerned, we've got to get to the market before the competition.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145782_0146250 Ours has to look really great and it has to come out before the others.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146250_0146840 so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146840_0147354 and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0147354_0148032 If we try to sell people it has too many great features, the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148032_0148872 So we've got to narrow our selection down to two things, I think, that we're going to say are really great about our new product.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148872_0149481 And I've been looking around at what designs, every year, different things are popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149481_0149939 And in my research this year, I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149939_0150324 and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150324_0150982 They're more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150982_0151470 So those are things maybe we want to look at as far as saleability of the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0154519_0154897 You want to try to come back to yours? Yes, I would like to.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0155631_0155945 So speed track ignition is most important as far as you're concerned.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156276_0156529 Yeah, that could be our star feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156529_0156793 That might be really good, yeah. I agree with that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0157714_0157817 distance problems.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163036_0163363 I think battery. I think we all agreed on that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163363_0163659 That's going to be most cost effective and the best thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0164816_0165230 bright, colourful, trendy design and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0168945_0169070 Something like different
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169264_0169694 Yeah, or like, or like Crispy trying to give you a shoe, but also a supplement.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169694_0169928 Speech recognition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0170012_0170726 Okay, so why don't we put down speed track ignition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0176912_0177406 Where were they hiding?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0003938_0004133 Well, hi everyone again.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0004324_0005440 Like before, I have to review the minutes from the last meeting. And so here we go.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0005591_0006464 It was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0006567_0007903 designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the TV.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0007903_0008979 It should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control, features, color, contrast, sharpness, etc.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009020_0009435 a memory switch, a mute button in case the telephone rings or something
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009435_0010653 Speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to see to be integrated in this new remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0011091_0012013 Should be child-friendly design with few buttons, colourful maybe with star-shaped or other shaped buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0012013_0012926 She presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013217_0013332 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013485_0014410 But her very personal favorite, really, she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0014410_0015315 The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0015315_0016438 She would like a special paste made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0016564_0017116 should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0017284_0018010 Should we like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated in
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0018010_0019144 Technically, this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitator, diode, transistor, resonator, and if possible rechargeable battery.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019263_0019471 and of course the circuit board.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019599_0019852 and how it works, you press the button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019852_0022001 the chip is Morse code related, relates the, to the generator amplification. And the circuit board is very inexpensive to build. And so she thinks this is a great feature to consider
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022216_0022696 She would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022804_0023264 The scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0023384_0023891 should be battery operated and of course should have the special cases.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0024040_0025146 The marketing expert who has to finally come up to market this product has been watching the competition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0025146_0026273 has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0026431_0026654 easy to use and it should be eye-catching.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0027036_0027745 From her point of view, of course, one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0028058_0029057 To do that, maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on, or in other words, on which our campaign could be built on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029213_0029697 too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029697_0030149 So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030288_0030916 it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030916_0031126 She feels that's really what people want today.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0031293_0032097 The decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0032218_0033189 The energy should be battery, should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong and should have buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0033325_0033798 And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes, from the last meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0034072_0034535 Now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0042922_0043023 That's okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0046331_0046436 என்ன?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052178_0052253 What kind of button?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052399_0052600 A menu.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064279_0064480 Yes, the buttons are all raised, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064566_0064651 raised and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0065317_0065522 You have to have two hands to open it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0067081_0067808 Yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you don't have to first go like, oh yeah, here it's on and...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0069570_0069806 So if you're left handed or right handed.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072255_0072883 I have one question. Will there be anything written on the buttons?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072883_0073380 like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0073933_0074457 will have symbols so that the user really knows, you know, it doesn't have to...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0074976_0075613 But anyway, it has to have some kind of symbols, text or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075772_0075805 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075924_0076155 Okay, I just want to make sure of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0076927_0077000 Right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079005_0079329 What are our special features for the marketing?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079329_0079718 that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0080276_0080937 And then the other thing would basically be the shape or practicality of use.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0081109_0081159 I will.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084293_0084575 Okay, now having said that...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084864_0085297 No, this was evaluation criteria which we just have done.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0085297_0085576 Now we're going to talk about financing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086184_0086437 When there is a production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086485 that you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086604_0086809 but that's after the financing. Oh, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086872_0086929 你先吃
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087539_0087996 Okay, we had looks and voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087996_0088686 Okay now on the financing we bring up the...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0088686_0089440 Okay, energy source, we say that's battery, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0089637_0089762 Okay, now.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090085_0090281 So we, I guess we use one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090983_0091358 If you have a seller chart, you are trying to change it for 50.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091358_0091446 Oh, that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091530_0091813 I could just change it here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091913_0091984 Doesn't work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092731_0092979 Oh, okay, yeah, okay, let's see.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092979_0093328 Okay, one, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093328_0093443 I'll go away.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093443_0093918 kinetic source. So that's in the energy source that's all we need.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093918_0094226 electronic simple chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094226_0094356 Is that what we're using?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094356_0094432 one of those.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094559_0094685 Come on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094685_0094872 Okay, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094872_0095121 Regular chip on print.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0095286_0095859 That's all we need. The one case. Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096704_0096864 Double curved.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096864_0096935 one of those.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097223_0097444 case material supplements.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097444_0097645 Plastic we sent, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097826_0097962 wood rubber
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098268_0098462 But yes, but
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098722_0099264 That's just for the case material. Special color, so we're having that, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0099509_0099901 And then we have the interface push buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100368_0100500 Scroll wheel, no.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100500_0100770 integrated score with LC display
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101319_0101533 button supplement special color
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101770_0101856 special forms.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0102276_0102552 and special material rubber wood yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103051_0103417 total 7.6 whatever that means
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103665_0103782 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104079_0104235 8.2
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104683_0104824 points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104967_0105054 8.2 right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105236_0105427 So we look like we are.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105564_0105656 well within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0106093_0106272 I should say, since the first one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0107999_0108108 Mm-hmm.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108661_0108807 I just tried that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108807_0108969 Now I don't need a computer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108969_0109144 I'm issues.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0109683_0109836 Okay, fine.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110140_0110431 Okay good, so that's the good news.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110431_0110834 You're going to be popular.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111164_0111424 So that, I think, financing was pretty simple.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111535_0112165 Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0114600_0114759 You want to go the next night? Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131419_0131783 I just realized one thing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131783_0132180 In the financing there was no room for our voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0132429_0133181 And I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0133554_0133711 820, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134116_0134616 I mean, maximum we have another 4.3 euros, I mean 4.30.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134767_0135522 But we have no way of presenting that to management as a finished product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0135522_0136083 as a finished product and saying, okay, with a waste recogniser that costs so much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136202_0136654 So we just have to be aware of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136654_0137085 I mean, and know whether the 430 will really cover that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0139488_0140779 I'm sorry to interrupt that but I just remembered that there was no room for any special features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0140907_0141086 So be aware of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141086_0141328 You want to go to this next slide?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141540_0141654 I don't know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141654_0141780 Yes, it was my muscle.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0144286_0144428 I'm buying that up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0145622_0145736 I think you can make it there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0148505_0148664 Yes, I think shape is one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0149756_0149886 You gave me the full order.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150247_0150389 Um, I don't know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150516_0150699 I think I would give it at least a two.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152596_0152725 Collar.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152988_0153157 I like the colors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0154776_0154971 I think I will give it a 2
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0156922_0157788 Well, it's also you can't really try it out. The other things you have more, it's more tangible. So from that point of view, but...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0158088_0158204 I'll give it a three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0163765_0164417 Here is what we're looking at satisfaction, for example, room for creativity.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0164981_0165391 Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0171858_0172740 Always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still, you know, we probably can't
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0172740_0173341 With this particular item we probably can't just add a whole lot of more things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0173341_0174395 We need to leave space money-wise for the voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0174986_0175438 So the question really is how do we feel with the project process?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0175438_0176658 Are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0176806_0177143 Personally, I think I'm pretty happy.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177258_0177401 And so, I'm going to go ahead and start with the first one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177613_0178216 And then the next question is, are we happy with the leadership of this project?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0178586_0179168 And I think teamwork was very, very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179398_0179899 and I think we are happy with the means we used.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179899_0180315 we used whiteboard, we didn't use digital pens against these things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180745_0180864 Yes, we could.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180927_0182201 It's maybe not in the best position in the room. Sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody. And I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0182303_0183135 because it was better positioned. Yes, I think so. I think absolutely. And fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183135_0183441 Did we find new ideas?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183441_0183527 I think we did.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183727_0184471 I think we did in more than one respect and so I think we did very well here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184719_0184848 are the costs within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184848_0184947 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184947_0185232 i projekta je vjerojena.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0185367_0185861 Celebration. Then celebration.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186464_0186776 So I thank you all very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186776_0187153 I think this was very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187272_0187669 I think we did come up with a new product that's feasible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187669_0188086 visible from the production point of view and visible from a marketing point of view.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0188280_0188412 So, thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0189421_0189660 I always get it on here, like getting it off.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0190479_0190598 Oh yeah, we have time.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035625_0035939 So this is what we have made.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035939_0036376 This is a model of the remote controller which we are going to build.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0036376_0038147 This is in a snail shape. So it is attractive and it's blue in color, bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons. So it is, look-wise it is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038147_0038429 and also compact in shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038429_0039128 and also it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039300_0039665 Yeah. Oops.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039828_0041301 The material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and which is strong and also for the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0041445_0042426 The material is plastic and for the buttons it is a soft rubber. Oh, that's good. Yeah, that's nice and fresh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0042426_0042999 Yeah because you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043039_0043332 and then for the lead.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043332_0044239 For the light emitting diode, it is a fluorescent green and it is a bulb like an ordinary inflow rate.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0044413_0044878 And the button buttons part will be explained by fast enough
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0062030_0062128 then
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0073522_0073605 These buttons will
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0074614_0074775 going into an international market.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075161_0075253 It has to have some
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075541_0076079 We can have on the case itself. That's right. It will be printed on the case. Okay. I just want to make sure.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0077042_0077318 the snail shell he goes right back into his shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0078699_0078921 or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0094238_0094352 Is that what we're using?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0096277_0096347 This is a
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0098501_0098936 I think that is just for the case material.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103508_0103763 I think that's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103915_0104042 いいよ、いいよ、いいよ
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0108986_0109101 I'm issues.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133675_0133765 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133822_0134090 We've still got four year olds to go to spend.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138186_0138315 that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138953_0139031 Yeah
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0140240_0140346 included
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0148666_0148936 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151175_0151364 Even I think it is one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151364_0151441 explains more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0153266_0153342 Yeah, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0155570_0155756 Maybe two?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0158869_0159019 Three
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165533_0165606 We begin our video.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165682_0166106 include some more buttons and features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166106_0166342 we can make the buttons few buttons smaller
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166342_0167206 I think they are quite big so I think we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0167206_0167460 if we want to have more features in that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0168404_0168517 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0169338_0169663 instead of having two mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0177249_0177331 uh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0178437_0178646 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0180636_0180757 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0183540_0183677 Yeah, many.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0188433_0188521 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0189656_0189882 I think we still have some time left.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190111_0190291 You have
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190908_0190969 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0034881_0035112 Does it look like the button part I have used?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0044970_0045542 Now we decided upon including certain features and our remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0045542_0046564 Now these features includes the signal emitting signal it's the LED or LED, the infrared.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0046564_0046958 Now we have included the switch on and off button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0047312_0047703 Now we have included another feature that is the mute button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048112_0048363 on the side of the model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048363_0048767 then we have included 1 to 9 buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048890_0049190 for controlling the programs, the different channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0049751_0050264 We've also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0050738_0051294 and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0051690_0052136 Now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button.

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052836_0053649 We have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color, sharpness, brightness
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0053896_0054005 of this picture.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054300_0054709 We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054854_0055307 Now this is a special feature which we have included.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055307_0055379 have this button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055525_0056591 is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible. So if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0056591_0056916 if it is turned towards the right, it will take to the next jump.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057045_0057353 to take the user to the previous and the next channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057662_0057755 swapping buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0058428_0059316 Swapping is if example you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059316_0059420 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059919_0060901 And at the end, this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer, which will recognize the user's voice. And then it will act accordingly.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061477_0061773 So this is a proposed model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061773_0061987 Now the marketing expert has to.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0062120_0062796 give her suggestion when it will be sellable or it will be cost effective.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0063532_0063628 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0067684_0067788 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0068745_0069236 No, these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069236_0069323 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069916_0069948 funny
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069986_0070147 This is the menu on the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0070404_0071261 These two are to increase or decrease the volumes. And these two are to scroll the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0071408_0071569 scroll up or scroll down the channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0073384_0074001 Yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0074001_0074203 so that they can be easily related.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076128_0076730 And one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076730_0076808 shell shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076928_0077026 Right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0077093_0077224 He goes right back to the shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0078678_0078822 Or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0096360_0096459 It's a good girl.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0098878_0098991 Oh, okay.

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0108498_0108598 in the tester.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0123878_0124032 That's what people are going to do.

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0147847_0147931 Eu não sei o que é isso aqui.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0155305_0155381 I'll give three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165536_0165724 We can always improve.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165869_0165978 Yes, features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0171906_0172054 always bearing in mind that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0178402_0178668 Yes, yes, yes, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0180493_0180786 a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0185498_0185849 Celebrate it, she insists.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0188429_0188486 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0190292_0190402 They say it's 40 minutes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0013037_0013522 She was challenged on that point.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0039502_0040024 You used to have all the buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0042228_0042451 Oh, that's good. Yeah, that's us in French.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0046289_0046397 और NET
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0052441_0052514 Menú.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053828_0053902 of the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053902_0053969 This
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058041_0058417 The next channel in the numeric pattern or?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058778_0058833 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0059376_0059485 Okay, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0062821_0062982 Okay, well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063112_0063579 What I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb. Yes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063579_0064261 that you can really hold it in one hand. You don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0064511_0065246 The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand, you can even reach it over here. So you don't have to turn it around.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065246_0065653 turn it upside down, move it up and down. I really like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065653_0066194 You really did a good job on that. My little designers.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066194_0066948 And I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066948_0067118 That's a really good thing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067220_0067346 So that's really...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067786_0068008 The color is very attractive.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068008_0068633 These buttons around here are the mute.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068759_0069052 So these the front buttons which are here are the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069159_0069314 On both sides? Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069314_0069519 So you can push either one? Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069703_0069948 And this brings the menu up on the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069948_0070393 This brings the menu up on the screen. And the orange ones are...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071210_0071387 channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071387_0071489 Screw that was
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071589_0071843 That looks like something I can sell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0072104_0072410 Okay, now I'm supposed to... I have one question.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0074373_0074971 That's a good point because we need the symbols because we're going into an international market. We can't have anything that's language dependent.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075356_0075447 Symbolize.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075447_0075544 text or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076158_0076217 one more feature
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076855_0077167 for the snail. We have the snail shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077167_0077358 He goes right back into his soul.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077358_0078888 Well, you know, I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0078888_0079032 That would really work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0079632_0080257 I think voice recognition is our big selling point because nobody else seems to have that in this price range.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0080981_0081579 Yeah. Well, I think that everybody's going to say their remote control is practical.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0081579_0082128 I think we have to dwell on the appearance.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082128_0082331 you're really going to have the best.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082445_0082708 cutest remote control on the block.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082708_0083555 So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image, play with the visual, and then the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083555_0083713 And I think those are the two things to push.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083713_0083762 the look.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083897_0084011 and the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084011_0084185 they're going to be our two selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084556_0084761 I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0085663_0086259 Ah, that's in my instructions. I think it's how I'm supposed to go to the board and do something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086517_0086566 Give us me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086744_0086822 아, 오케이.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086822_0087076 Sorry
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0087076_0087088 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0089556_0089598 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0092477_0092677 Can you just fill it in the yellow boxes?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0096533_0096673 I guess it's double curve.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0097975_0098164 rubber because we're going to have the soft buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0098936_0099082 Oh, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0100797_0101105 No, no, but we didn't put the clock in it after all.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0112217_0112448 I'll take my file down so you can bring it up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0113791_0113889 keşfi
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114272_0114502 Okay, why don't you go just to the next slide right away.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114688_0114846 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114846_0115717 Okay, well, obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first ask the big question, will it sell?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0115717_0116800 And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0116800_0117268 We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117268_0117552 and show the prototype to consumer research groups.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117552_0118356 We don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118356_0118628 So we have to get some input from those people.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118628_0119064 And then after that, we just have to go with our best intuition. We like it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119064_0119388 We think it's good. We're going to get behind it and sell it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119388_0119535 Next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119781_0120514 Okay, now the things that I was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120514_0120928 I wanted the shape to be biomorphic. I didn't want anything with angles. I'm all square.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120928_0121283 I wanted to be comfy and roundy, so we got that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121283_0121644 Size is small, the color is bright and warm, which is what we wanted.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121644_0122239 We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible. We'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122239_0122686 even though it's going to be hard plastic, it feels good in your hands, so that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122686_0123207 and functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0123207_0124124 So paradoxically, the other features, in other words, the look, the feel, and the shape, that's what people are going to get in the store.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124124_0124344 They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124378_0124658 So they'll be our main selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124658_0125417 So those have been fulfilled by your prototype. And go ahead to the next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0125417_0126043 Okay, so the shape I think is a one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126043_0126301 It's really, really excellent shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126301_0127341 The size is small and these points are the importance for the marketing. These aren't in how I feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127341_0127967 I think that it's plenty small enough to sell, but I think we're sort of right. The scale is one to seven.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127967_0128408 I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128456_0128620 and our color I think is great.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128620_0128975 The colors are bright and warm and really do a great job there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128975_0129552 And given the constraints that we had, I think we got it as soft as possible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0129552_0130090 And then functionality, I think you did a really good job on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0130090_0131014 obviously we could have added different functions, but then we disturbed something else. So I would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0131014_0131379 So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133143_0133582 Well, we had what, 8 euros 20 as our cost?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133730_0134107 And so we've got about four year olds to go to spend.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0134602_0134830 Well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137150_0137939 Well as we know in today's technological world you can do just about anything at any price. The problem is quality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137939_0138351 So we're just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0138351_0139103 And it may not be the greatest quality, but it may sell anyway. Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0139103_0139488 as we've seen with so many of these kind of products.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141252_0141534 Well, isn't this my last slide?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141607_0141656 Good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141656_0141844 I think that was my last lockdown.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142274_0142365 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142596_0142934 I'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142934_0143589 And we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now. So if you put my last slide back up there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0143817_0144241 I'm sorry.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0144660_0144894 Well, because I can't remember where I put all my...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145310_0145611 I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145761_0145853 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145937_0146050 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146050_0146395 So, now we're all supposed to say what we think.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146395_0146789 Okay, so, shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147227_0147341 I gave it one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147480_0147945 One being good and seven being the worst.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147945_0148244 What do you think the shape is?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148244_0148497 Okay, that's it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148683_0149060 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149060_0149273 And how about on size?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149676_0149785 Long size.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149863_0150178 I give it a 4. I feel it's just average.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0151479_0152066 You're the designer. Of course you want to give me one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152066_0152323 And then how about how we do it on color?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152668_0152819 I gave it a watch
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152819_0153059 I really like all those nice bright warm colors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153405_0153617 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153617_0153839 Här har vi alltså single.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0154126_0154680 taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155051_0155410 Okay, I'll give it a three, two, one. I'll give three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155687_0155789 Tchau, boa noite.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155919_0156691 And the next is functionality, where I admit I was a little hard on our team here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0158686_0158775 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159432_0159557 Well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159803_0160156 It looks like we've got ourselves a pretty good product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0160156_0161362 Functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about maybe having another meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0161362_0161910 But otherwise, I think we're ready to go with this product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0162068_0162501 Does anybody else have any other comments or any other things that you feel we should evaluate?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0167642_0168775 Well then again if we're going to do the speech recognition thing, there are going to be some buttons that are going to have to be added for that for the recording of the speech.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0168775_0169598 So that's where we're going to have to do, maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0169598_0170293 And then maybe we can do something with the...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170425_0170535 the volume control.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170535_0170789 We can put that all on one button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170918_0171804 and a couple of other, maybe consolidate some of the usage and see what we can do with that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0177170_0177576 I'm pretty happy with it. It's something I think I can market.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178213_0178697 I think you've done a good job this year. Yes, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178981_0179274 I think maybe we...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0180322_0180811 Maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182205_0182421 And then we used the slide because it was better positioned.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182537_0182670 Absolutely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0183545_0183798 I think we were very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185190_0185260 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185896_0186554 Today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them we have champagne.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0188646_0188930 Watch out, I have my cord behind me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0190501_0191179 Yeah, we have time, but we don't have to. We were told we could end the final meeting at any time. Okay. Whenever we felt we were finished. Yeah, we didn't have to finish.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0191856_0192197 I'm going to take these rest and try to get my microphone out from my necklace.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0192517_0192575 There we go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447 I was gonna draw cat tubes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812 Let's try something else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060 Something different than Garfield.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246 Mine is a bit more skinny.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553 おやすみ
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971 It's supposed to be a camera.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118 I like Catholicism.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106407_0106456 there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0107490_0107525 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0109049_0109083 I'm sorry.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0126778_0126843 Yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256 They were all mentioned.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673 Good morning.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955 We zien alle ingeerde plaatsen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125 Are you able to sit on the right place?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629 I guess so.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003264_0003336 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809 I still introduce myself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274 Everybody knows me.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801 Let's start off with a little presentation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834 First I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037 You can see the field cameras here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797 They'll record our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416 There are also some microphones there, but you don't have to pay a lot of attention to those.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014 because it will disappear when you don't attend to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424 These are project documents folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919 there's some
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145 I'll start with the presentation kickoff.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968 It's pretty modified by the ministry.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206 Okay
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227 Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for real reaction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529 It's a company in electronics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476 Fashion electronics make it work. A lot of effort in designing the body itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865 I'm Martin Buit and I'm the project manager. So I'll direct you through the project.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177 This is our agenda.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771 We have an open recording installed during the music planning session closing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902 Maybe I can sit down and take some notes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442 Maybe you can take the menus. Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136 I don't know, it's not a long word, but just if you hear something like that, just write it back.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525 As you can see, it's the opening.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917 Yeah, I think this is the point we've done a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314 Have you all seen the corporate website already?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701 Have you seen any flaws?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949 I think I found one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019352_0019396 KATHRYN
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753 Let's see if it works this time.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054 That doesn't work here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274 But on the corporate information side, there was real remote instead of real reaction. Oh yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934 Real remote is not really the company we are, but it's going to end up.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335 Okay, what are we going to do?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735 Our project aim is as you can see a new remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113 That's the original, trendy and user friendly.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811 So these are the points why we also hired you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629 We've got a marketing expert for the trendy and user-friendly look.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214 and industrial designer. That's also usually friendly and original.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776 And we've got our user interface designed.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899 It's possible.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206 That's about the near remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089 Project Method is the three phases we're going through.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568 The first is functional design, you fetch over meetings.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992 na de fractie, conceptueel en detail design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683 I have some little indications here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177 But I think you know it already by yourself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124 De industriele designer gaat werken op de werkelijke design, de componentendesign en een beetje de kijk-en-geel-design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102 De User Interface Designer gaat naar de Technische Functie Design, User Interface Concept en User Interface Design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0031102_0032189 and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements, specification, trend watching and product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473 Dat is wat je gaat doen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816 But that will be all worked out. All the amazings.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524 Then we've got our first tool training.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263 We're going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here. So it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870 As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here and the white board.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579 In the whiteboard here is a little toolbar on this side.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682 Here are some pictures.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790 you can save.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251 these features we don't have anything to do with. Only undo, you can undo a little.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563 Piece of drawing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897 a blank new document for each person.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144 Select pen, eraser.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423 I'll get your redone list to do anything with.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867 Then we've got our pen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005 This band.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928 It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page. In the, I think it is, form of.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305 You can also select the current color and the line width.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673 But first you have to select the BEM function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011 We're going to work with it in a minute.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873 It's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings in there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081 Then
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513 A short thing about documents.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935 We've got our shared folder, project name, project, what's that?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279 for checking documents.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895 But you all found it already because there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697 And these are available on the smart boards as well. So if you have a document you want to show, you can just open it from the following.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097 Here is the simple tool work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751 That's what it said, save, print, move back or forward one page.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947 You can switch between the different colors.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479 And then we're going to try out the whiteboard.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119 So as you can see we are going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785 Just to get a bit familiar with it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932 No, it's because he's not running away.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351 Does anybody have anything with them now?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721 We're going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367 and just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213 The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607 This I can start from there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177 You can use this pen by holding it like a little child.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801 because if you hold it like this, sensors will get blocked.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366 Another thing is you have to be a bit slow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895 Os ydych chi'n mynd i mi ddryfio'r ffordd, yna byddwn yn gwybod.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051895_0052898 So we choose format. I think gray is appropriate.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052898_0052990 Then the line.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502 8, 7 will be nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863 Now you'll see my drawing capabilities.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193 That's very nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579 You have to do a real self.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800 I was trying to go adult.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204 Sorry.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330 And, go ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775 Now we've got another function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063 Are you ready?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197 and I can do
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576 This is easy.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878 That's good.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429 And I'm going to write down a few of his characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744 Uh...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469 Рекомендую тексту.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677 This is typically a blue action, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107 Maybe I should hold it a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408 That's the same thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073 I think that's it because if you want to do it like this then you can strike.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319 I don't know. Just try.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182 This is not mine.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320 That is interesting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068929_0068980 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319 This was a...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319 I'm not great at this, but I'm not great at this. I'm about to go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477 This with...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194 So now I'm gonna hand over Ben, and he'll play sheet two.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407 Go ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838 Maybe it's easier to draw with a smaller line lift, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126 because this is going a little bit in idea.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669 It's a real dutchie.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081 Recognition.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551 Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084551_0084628 Interesting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666 Yeah, just think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351 Yeah, he's gimmick.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283 Is it your cat or did you find him on the street?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818 So everybody knows how the whiteboard works now.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508 If you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the line for it, just ask and go ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679 Yeah, easy.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677 Thank you for being here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990 Dus je hebt een toon in je blokje.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506 Move along to the project finance.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430 As you can see, for a remote control, the Sonic Brides is 25 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648 I should have a prize.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946 Our profit aim is 50 million euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775 That's the beast we have to get from our remote controls. So we have to work together to reach our aims.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717 We can do it internationally, so we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures and different kind of trends as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143 But that's all in the later stadium.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933 Our production cost can be a maximum of 12.5 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883 So that's also a point we have to keep in mind, that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060 It goes where?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394 So just try to remember these points.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393 The selling price is 25, often age 15 million, but more important is the international market we're trying to focus on.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770 and production cost maximum 12.5 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275 So this leads us to our little discussion.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783 You've got about 5 or 10 minutes left for discretion.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140 So I'm gonna sit down and think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442 It's easier.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622 I've got a message.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120622_0120698 Life news.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118 Okay, I guess you have a good time. So just on the side note.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952 Maybe you have to say the magic word.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208 Does it do it?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553 Maybe you have to just clap it down.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122828_0122914 Back up again.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568 Let's see what you do.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123733_0123799 itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948 It's pretty big on that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102 Bueno, vamos.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649 Let's do those netlips.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124998_0126251 Does everybody have experiences with remote controls? I mean not the ordinary remote controls but also a little bit different ones.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555 I can use for other.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0127905_0127958 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777 Yeah, I've got one at home.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653 and you can program I think eight different devices in it and you can use it for your television and anything else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326 and it also operates on infrared so you have got a little device inside your room
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868 and then you can operate it from the third or second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716 So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs and you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893 So that's a pretty handy
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460 Ik ben ook niet de...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401 I think if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133401_0133481 See you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757 It's good to remember.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250 Yeah, that's nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482 So we want different functions.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420 And we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720 Maar ik weet niet of dat de productiepunten meer zal worden.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021 So this is something we have to find out, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893 and other functions for remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329 You can make it to...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137725_0137806 Approve.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500 So these are a few things you can think of.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030 I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040 So I can see that it stays.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726 That's an idea as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142726_0142792 و لا اديس
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142928_0142988 I think I did.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680 Any questions about this presentation?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793 kickoff presentation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790 Oké, dan zet ik de minuten van deze meting in de projectfolder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048 and then it can all work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405 Finish meeting now.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955 We kunnen allemaal werken op onze eigen projecten.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455 Okay, then I'll meet you in about an hour. Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639 Have a good one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0076704_0076747 She
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595 Just gonna drive it

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352 Show us the list.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097503_0097536 Oh.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097650_0097761 I feel better.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097848_0097894 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0098652_0098803 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099099_0099154 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539 Um, who's playing?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802 Ok, merci.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126436_0126474 No, really.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126779_0126875 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580 Okay, yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751 Second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137604_0137671 Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110 What a proof, right?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494 Eh, you never know.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0141037_0141123 Ok, non c'è
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004079_0004149 much.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004810_0004844 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0018307_0018353 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267 I guess I paid much attention to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0021216_0021268 Oh yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0046928_0047006 Nice and smooth.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892 Well, thinking about a sword fiction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0071206_0071246 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250 .
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613 and control the light.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584 Okay, I love what you're writing, but here you go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833 This is my...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320 that you adopt animals and spread in their butts.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084648_0084705 They were.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084935_0084977 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049 Let's go really slowly through the rain.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144 They're building animals.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316 And that's just a little thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667 Garfield.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700 .
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0110215_0110298 for being here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120296 There you go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414 So just on a side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0123611_0123667 It's off now.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159 Λοιπόν, βάζω.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124708_0124779 There we are.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126746_0126820 Well, yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508 kind of brought TV at home and a DVD player so we got like a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030 One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442 And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0130808_0130852 Really?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967 So I think you can get minutes again.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0134155_0134240 It's a journey.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478 But that would be really good if we could do that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534 I think it has to be shock-proof.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045 My remote control tends to follow that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381 Yeah, one other little thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763 I thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140875_0140940 So you can see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213 How much is left on the battery?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994 but they'll also really drag up the production costs. We'll have to see about that too.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437 Ond efallai unrhyw ddiddordeb.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0144083_0144179 I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0145529_0145582 We can all.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0147202_0147250 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232 Well, I think if we're going to use a touchscreen, we're going to go way above the 12.5 euros.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266 So it wouldn't be very robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531 It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777 Okay, I've got a presentation about the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003 first about how it works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099 It's really simple, of course.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285 everybody knows how the remote works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468 You should press this button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999 The remote determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send a signal to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301 the TV switches to the frequency or what function it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811 So we've got the plate.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206 It's got conductive disks for every button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983 When the user presses a button, a signal gets sent. It goes to the lab and transmits it to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340 It's a very simple device technically.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614 So this is a schematic overview.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802 We've got the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017 Power source.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468 and when a button gets pressed it goes to the chip.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059 The chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324 When you press a button you can actually see you pressed a button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094 Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441 Keep the inner working simple so it's robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841 I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301 because if you're going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105 You only have to design a remote once and if you use high-tech materials it comes back in every product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046 So in my idea it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250 That's it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073 I think that if we put our marketing right, we can sell this just like, I don't know if you've heard about it in the news.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281 the elderly mobile phone.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249 If we make a remote control, just with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872 We don't have to focus on the design then, but on functionality.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940 We just.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346 change our focus on the project.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636 We can sell this.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330 That's a good idea.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275 And besides that, if we're going to focus on the elderly people, they'll have to adapt.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548 they're not used to using scroll buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860 So perhaps we should stick to the basic layer.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426 It should be possible, yes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604 Het is niet te fijn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913 and if the remote stays rather small with you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902 So we're just going to focus on the extras.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548 Like with the keychain if you play solid goes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974 I think we'll have to choose between the docking station and the screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187119_0187191 So let's go.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094 I don't think they have different television sets
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344 in every country.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002 Everybody find this place again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370 That's nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777 This is our second meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100 And still fairly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726 Now we're going into the functional design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007726_0009245 The important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719 So that we can move on to the second phase.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959 the first space
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273 First announcement
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705 there's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288 There's our ghost mouse again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018 That means that you can have a little trouble with air conditioning. That's because of this.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339 That's in ways C and E.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853 So it should be over in a couple of days.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438 it's going to be cold anyway so...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584 than our agenda.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747 Yeah, first the opening.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911 This time I will take the minutes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375 You're going to have a presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502 Oh dear.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365 And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769 So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354 and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291 and then the decision on the control functions, which you want to include.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511 I've got 40 minutes for all of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947 So I suggest that we start with the first presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134 Who wants to be first?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337 Maybe it's easy if you... Yeah, I think you'll tell them your presentation as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787 which function you have and what you're going to talk about.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054004_0054103 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516 Anybody have any questions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829 That's the actual requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054829_0054905 Okay, that's good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160 Ja, jeg har taget det sikkert.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571 Yeah, you can take your time.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860 Wir haben hier einen WKF.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0058229_0058319 Good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638 but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610 Anyone has questions about the technical functions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654 That's nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727 Yeah, it's really good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130 Maybe we can first listen to your presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669 And then we'll have a little discussion about the requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351 I think it's going to do.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0102358_0102401 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926 Okay, now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we're doing right now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724 I'm the project manager so I'm here to mess things up and play some new requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739 We've got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0106739_0107827 That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096 So it has to be simple.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600 Another point is we have to skip the data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108600_0109601 want in de wereld van de toekomstige internet denken we dat data tax een verhaal van de verleden zal zijn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069 and it's a function we don't need in our remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739 Internet is also mentioned, just go to the function you can use.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063 Misschien ook op tv, die ook opgepast zal zijn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672 Another one is the customer is 40 plus.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578 That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257 This is a bit pity for the marketing expert.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682 because he was aiming on the younger persons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200 So we have to find a market which is above 40 plus, but which will suit our...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648 remote control and the other way around.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449 and we have to be very attentive in putting the image in our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026 So it has to be visible in our design, in the way our device works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572 and we have to be very clear on this point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721 So I suggest
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215 Let's have a discussion on the convolve function.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0117632_0118925 We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091 against the no data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559 Yeah, it's like...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107 pretty
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383 I think we can not...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238 Ik denk dat we veel kunnen doen met het ontwerp en de simpele knopjes die ook al gezegd zijn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970 If we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577 or just a remote which is suitable for the market you want to reach because it is 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305 En als je in Holland kijkt, de hele generatie van 40-plus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992 50 plus, it's the biggest share of the whole population now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668 But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456 People think that's the device I've looked for, although I didn't realize it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604 So let's try it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136353_0136447 It's a big success.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731 make a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367 We don't have to focus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011 I simply think
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830 that the new products we're going to make specifically designed
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726 are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0140860_0141918 And I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419 De kanaalselection is belangrijk.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809 volume, selection, power en teler text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055 Nee, we hebben het nog niet gevonden. Ik denk dat data text...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587 It can be a function as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776 But only if it's going to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134 higher the cost
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705 Because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well, but I don't think that will be a problem.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019 Where is the text?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751 So I suggest...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374 Is anybody really against data attacks?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956 We'll just keep the data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477 It's good idea as well, especially for the subtitles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786 Maybe we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123 make that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725 another point of advantage in our remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587 We make a button for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173 for elderly people that they can think, oh, I want to have subtitles. They push the button and they get the big subtitles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064 Dus ik denk dat edX kan heel erg gebruikbaar zijn in onze voordelen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617 Functionality should be few buttons, you said.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239 I think that's very important. We have a few buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701 Felly mae'n gweithio'n bwysig.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318 But do you need a radio?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219 You don't need it. Do you need the buttons for one to zero?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339 Maybe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911 Misschien kan je...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797 Je kunt de scroll button implementeren.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154 or joystick like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450 There are other ways too.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649 Hvis du ser på telefoner.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168 The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0163536_0163590 Yes, sir.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236 This is the numbers there.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076 We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display and if it's too much we can reconsider it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328 But I think that one reason is that it's better.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493 Ama sanmıyorum ki
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813 the number of residents.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082 I think it's very important in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763 You can make a very fancy design by putting the buttons in the right places.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041 If you have less buttons you can do a lot more with it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339 to operate on your TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393 So we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172982_0173031 That's right.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434 So you should just, we could better focus on, for example, the documentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717 Like other functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210 instead of less parents.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671 Do you think the docking station will...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115 is allowed in the budget we have.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504 It's not too far.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153 I think that's
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456 That's a good advantage point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363 if we have an anti-looking docking station or... That's a nice requirement.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0179483_0179580 Instillation
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0180046_0180112 I think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259 That's a good point.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868 you said they easily get lost as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939 Så måske skal vi implementere audio-sign eller noget.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706 So you know where it is. Audio signal should be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126 I think it's not too expensive.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279 Another
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692 or the LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591 I don't know if that will cost too much.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291 Felly, o'r ddau'n mynd i'r mha?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015 Just the LCD.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170 Just a normal screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190317_0190417 It's most really.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679 to some extra info.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060 I think that's a good idea as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584 It's the smallest thing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580 It's forbidden being full.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270 I think that should be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639 Um, let's see. What did we say?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233 Should be fancy design, easy to learn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469 few buttons you thought about that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768 Token Station LCD.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087 General functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280 and default materials
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196452_0197489 I think that's a good idea as well because other people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688 So it doesn't really matter.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944 So I think probably.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316 Let's specify the target group.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966 Are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from 40 to 80?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687 Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above 60 maybe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201043_0201135 What do we want?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925 If we want profilators, for example, the telephone for elderly people, we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252 target the real elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905 So that's the way it looks.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535 And you're talking about 6280, for example.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642 and different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205642_0205713 Very
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008 We've got five minutes left.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0207008_0207094 And with
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360 in different languages.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085 Or you have to put a language that will be necessary.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464 It's better to put it on different markets.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880 So that's the target.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323 Then a few small things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808 Okay.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226 I will put the minutes in the project document folder.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102 What we are going to do for the next reading is the industrial designer will do the component
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432 As an interface designer, I use interface concepts and trend watching.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212458_0213492 So just keep in mind things we've said about the target group requirements and the trends which are going on.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955 and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385 So thank you for this meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656 And I think we have a lunch break now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936 So that's a good thing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139 Okay.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775 Usual interface of iets?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117 for the technical function of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658 Um... yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215 I think we must use the general functions of the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0059215_0060963 I've done a little research on the internet, not much information about it, about the interface.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113 Yeah, I've been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844 So you've got a lot of devices like DVD, television, stereo.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948 so bad.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317 but it must be user friendly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041 Dus je kunt veel functies in één...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588 Everyone, remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064588_0064676 but.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318 It's got many functions in one remote control, but you can see this is a quite simple remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014 few buttons but this remote control got a lot of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502 People don't like it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347 What I was thinking about was keeping general functions like AR.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665 like the on and off button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974 Keep it like Red Bird.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596 everybody knows it so you don't have to change it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183 personal preferences
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706 gebruik het display voor speciale functies van het verschillende apparaat.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070706_0070792 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491 What I was thinking about was you've got
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217 This is the remote controller. You've got here the general functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145 like the on and off button, sound, I don't know. Here you've got a kind of display.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438 This is a touch screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074438_0075919 So, you've got the general function software device for a DVD player. So, for playing reverse data.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452 We've got here real buttons for selecting a device.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0076586_0078034 Dus dit is de bedoeling voor de DV. Voor elke app heb je een aparte display of aparte knoppen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621 So you never got all the buttons on one device.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045 So that's my idea about it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323 Um, yeah, and...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945 So that's good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395 En de real buttons die we hebben te gebruiken...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994 We moeten veel meer bedden gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294 iedereen moet het gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664 van oude mensen, jonge mensen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268 So we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082833_0082896 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237 Dat was mijn korte vriend.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427 I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751 you got quite a cheap touch screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069 It's not a corridor or something.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648 It's just one call. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683 I've seen something on the internet, not today, but a few weeks ago.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961 Det gikk ganske...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685 kind of touch screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287 20 euros or less
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515 So, it's buzz-mouthing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0089662_0089761 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395 deaf people need the text for subtitles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506 So it's, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0150585_0150660 for elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617 I mean it for TV
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713 Anyway, we can't skip this play, so we don't need it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000 and it's left.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0018276_0018355 I think I'll go first.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813 My name is Frick from Poland.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965 Thank you Mark, next room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091 Jól a nyílmény, de...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426 I've done some research
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302 We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556 We let them fill out a questionnaire.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822 We had 100 of these test subjects.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220 In addition we did some market research.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526 see what the market consists of.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664 what ages are involved.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460 Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753 Remotes are being considered oddly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963 75% of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633 people question indicated that they thought their remote were ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285 An additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733 In addition, remote run-ups are very functional.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332 50% of the people indicated they only use about 10% of the buttons on the remote controller.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939 And 50% of the people indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028233_0028307 some things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894 Then we did some research to do the most relevant functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664 Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867 The power button goes to 9.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117 And turn the effects to go to 6.5.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222 So these are the most.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700 most important functions of a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927 Then there are some one-time use functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087 That's what I like to call them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550 There are audio settings, video settings and channel settings buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074 which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702 Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943 168 times per hour.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502 And these are the, this is the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874 The main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical under remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285 They like to use new functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438 but they also are very critical.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637 They won't spend their money very easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423 The users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731 They're not really very interested in features.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997 but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811 Well, I think this indicates where
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336 I think we should make a remote for the future.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480 And this means we will...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984 I have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938 This also makes it the biggest part of the market, so that will also be where our main profit will be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342 This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614 The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that remote control caused errors.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217 This is certainly something to take into account.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921 And 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate new remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379 So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672 Besides of course that the remote must look very nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933 Functionality?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727 As a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons. I think we should make very few buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175 This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670 I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162 especially the channel selection or audio selection buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539 because they're used most and so they should be robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695 They shouldn't break down easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851 then as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, it might be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678 And I say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985 but it might be a good idea to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629 This would get a button in it which would send the signal to the remote which would then beep
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890 so you know where it is in the room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392 And in addition to this, it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0050571_0051711 then a surprisingly great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826 This was...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436 mostly people in the age of 16 to 25.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805 but up to 45 it remains feasible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574 This would also greatly increase the production cost, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0053859_0053925 There would be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0054420_0054490 Questions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050 Topping it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058050_0058150 Случаю.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058150_0058187 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837 Well, we certainly make a fancy design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089544_0089606 Let us tune.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796 So is there any discussion possible about any project requirements?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896 Yeah, because you're saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197 and new TVs will have internet access on them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863 But I think if you're targeting people of 40 plus, the chance that they will have a TV with internet access
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278 within the next like 20 years is very slim.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133 In addition, people indicated that Teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543 So I think it's pretty dumb to put no Teletex feature on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840 I'm pretty much against it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878 Besides that, I think the market for 40 plus is like...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123983_0124063 pretty small
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873 But if I see this, I think we're just going to go for another.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439 I think we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125565_0125638 I think we can do a little bit more.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298 Yes, but it's not the biggest part of the...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973 Besides that they're not very critical. So I mean they don't really care
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315 what the remote control is like.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688 They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see, which looks acceptable.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961 I think that would be the case in the...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414 16 to 45 age category.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077 because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605 people of 40 plus they wanted to work but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976 As soon as it works, it's okay with them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610 If we make a reminder...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275 but obviously the board tends to disagree.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146351_0146443 days.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971 I think it would definitely be a bad idea not to include them in the text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038 I don't think that's really an issue anymore.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154163_0154263 Well, might be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858 i mean
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329 You need the 1 to 0 button. Next channel, previous channel.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821 up, down, and some teletext buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360 Do you need a way?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508 I think you're going to include teletext, you do.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740 I think many people like to use that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506 If you want to switch from channel 1 to like 35, you don't want to push the next channel button 35 times
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525 That is true, but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089 I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238 And so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899 The TV would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220 I don't know if many channels would...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162420_0162508 Do have that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612 I don't know if you can see it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063 But I think if you're going to make remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497 having a few buttons as possible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313 because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV which already only have the minimum number of buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540 I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001 That is true, but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you're making a remote control only to operate only the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897 Because if you have remote control only to operate a TV, there's simply not a lot of buttons required.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553 there's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184 So I think it will be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602 That would cost a big marketing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173040_0173099 which was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663 one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845 Rwy'n meddwl y byddwn yn angen ffordd bwysig i gysylltu'r lluniau.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153 But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428 Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research into...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733 what other people like to have, you know.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039 I'd like to have extra in the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443 Yes, well 50% of the people indicated that the remote control tended to get lost.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188 Yeah, that was what I suggested.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919 You have it on some phones too, which have a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252 and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0184328_0184403 so you know where it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701 I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355 and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928 It might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, which will explain a button if you press it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068 which would tell you what it does.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747 and it wouldn't have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469 Just a small screen of it too.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307 I don't know
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635 to fit into the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437 I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0201108_0201183 I think.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807 I think it would be... if we should do something like that, it would be...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198 I think it would be really good for the image of the company.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681 And I think there would be good market for it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211 still able to really bring an innovative product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648 Yeah, really.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196 I have to look into that a little more.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517 and with the little screen in it which explains the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794 I think it would be a lot easier to...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113 adapted to different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0214713_0214775 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673 Buiten components design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321 For the energy source we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829 kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360 but if we choose for that option, the docking station could become obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601 so I don't think it's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583 For the casing, the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing, single or double
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859 and it's really up to the design that we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347 It doesn't imply any technical restrictions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153 As a case supplement we could, I thought of that later, a rubber belt like an anti-slip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677 For the buttons we can use plastic or rubber.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326 And the chipset, it says simple here but it should be advanced because we're using an LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026 and as the trendwatcher presentation shows people like Wood
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725 but it raises the price and doesn't really fit the image unless we would start two product lines.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913 Vormschiet voor de Fransche Abbera.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554 Well, the kinetic energy source is rather fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817 but it depends on what we want.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047 I think we should discuss that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706 For the case, the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523 and the chipset really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0091523_0091576 That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992 Yes, there are four options.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273 We could use the basic normal battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436 A hand dynamo.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719 but I don't think that's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113 You don't wanna swing before you can watch television?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261 solar cells.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667 but not every room is very light so it's not a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099667_0099767 or the kinetic energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754 You basically shake your remote and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101742_0101816 it's true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402 I don't have any informational pricing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632 So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810 That would also go for the LCD screen then I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165 a bit higher percentage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714 And that's the best choice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947 Well, there isn't any choice there because we're using the display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100 so it's got to be advanced.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061 I don't know if you didn't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305 I'll have to research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060 Well, the general, like most older remotes are flat, just straight.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699 and our manufacturing department can also do different single curved or double curved cases.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622 it would just only affect the form for as far as I know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003 So it's really just up to the design department what we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236 It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537 Pick one you like.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534 I think we should start by choosing a case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785 Because that's the basis of building them.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151 with the flat case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358 from the side to run it along.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993 with a single curve so I'm not really sure what they're going to look like but I think it's something like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632 So this type should be better for you or better, should prevent a stray injury a bit.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274 And the double grooves look something like this I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600 Those are the three options we have.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185 It's more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it's always a bone phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030 Maybe you should just start on a blank page.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425 Good afternoon.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837 There's a favorite meeting already.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093 I hope you enjoyed your lunch.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346 That is the correct way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602 Um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309 Three.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844 Okay, this is the second phase we're going to discuss today.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162 Het is een constructuele design meting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095 And a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409 conceptual specification of these are.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622 and also trend watching.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580 These are hopefully the points you addressed in your presentations. You're going to show me in a few minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215 uh...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404 First the opening.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621 Then we have three presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142 After that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383 Are we going to make it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600 And then we're closing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800 About 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221 So let's get started.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747 Did someone encounter any problems during the operation?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182 3, 2, 1
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011182_0011256 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177 Then a little thing about the last meaning.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469 These are the points we created.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758 the requirements and the target market.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012758_0013769 The requirements are data text, docking station, audio signal, small screen with some extra button information.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987 And we are going to use default materials.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661 Does somebody have any comments on these requirements?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611 These are just things we thought of, so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else, just let me know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755 Maybe you can work it out.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334 and we're going to target the 60 to 80 year old customers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402 So now everybody knows what we're doing. I suggest let's get started with the presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012 So you keep the same line up as last time.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452 Good luck.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736 Any questions about the trends?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365 Okay, we're going to the room.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0091739_0091784 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432 So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825 So these are the points we have to discuss.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318 First...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021 I think we can talk about the energy source since that's
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908 has a pretty big influence on production price and image.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011 So...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927 I think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077 Well, I think it's true. Elderly people just like to have everything in place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773 And I don't think they like remote, just laying everywhere in their rooms.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157 So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369 And also what you said.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186 you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964 but I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441 So you have a button on your docking station that you can push and then it starts beeping.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214 And then we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the channels.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396 I'm wondering
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198 That's a good point.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477 Good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791 easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961 I think that's a good point.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054 I personally think the LCD screen we want to use with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507 It's just some extra information and it's easy to ignore as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757 But if you don't want to use it, you just don't use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889 And yeah, I think maybe we have to discard the voice recognition.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431 because it will increase cost significantly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946 And I don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372 So that brings us back to the energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126 If we don't have voice recognition, it won't use a lot of energy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356 So in that case we could use kinetic energy, but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466 That much cheaper as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353 Okay, let me just choose for the battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484 That brings us to the chip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847 We're using the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465 Okay, that's first chip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455 en dan komen we naar het punt van het geval
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119 Um, which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652 If you want to choose for wood or the black and grey
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732 We're both.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723 As we saw, wood is a lot more expensive to produce.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033 But I think it will attract elderly people who want to have something exclusive which they can show off to their grandkids.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275 Got a new remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399 That's right.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850 But wood color was a lot more expensive.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038 You don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515 I think so, because...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064 It's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896 So in these cases.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413 Yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794 I think that's a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768 Want dan kun je ook verkopen als je vader een nieuwe plaats voor zijn remote-controle geeft of wat dan ook.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796 Because that's a it's something extra is it's something other remotes don't have which we can get a great advantage
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959 So and then you can make them with color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145 black and grey as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770 So you suggest we should design two different telephones?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830 on which you can apply different case covers. Well no, I think we should just...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767 So everybody is okay with the changing covers?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059 I think that's a good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555 In case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318 But the form has to be...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677 it has to be possible to stand up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912 Sadece
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416 and the cover of the docking station is also...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749 On to był w telewizji.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158749_0158792 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180 Yeah, you can do that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369 It's okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722 De interface...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048 what type of interface do we want to use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709 Maybe we can make a little drawing of it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144 on the board.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381 Somebody have ideas for a forum or?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252 Yeah, use a fuse will be a lot more difficult than that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349 But you have extra business.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495 so people can get confused.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086 yn y ffordd o'r holl ffordd.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234 Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173340_0173417 the same
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789 functions as the normal one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194 then yes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292 And you're good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482 Yes, it is great.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107 Uh... What's the thing?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553 It's the first time I've been here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069 No, it's not very handy I think.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520 Because the plasma mean will be opposite.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813 No, it's the finger.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100 I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349 Maybe each.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117 But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262 I think the functions are
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981 That basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589 So, so well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961 I think we can just leave it in normal shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365 And maybe we have to...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783 make it a bit more fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988 in another way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709 I suggest the single curve because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514 zodat de oudere mensen een remote controle kunnen gebruiken en tegelijkertijd gemakkelijk naar de schermen kijken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759 because it's a bit of an angle.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0197954_0198030 I think so.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198497_0198586 Давайте.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153 Do you have an upside down or? That's a top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581 So get your nose.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961 That's a good one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386 but I think it's better to put the screen on top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339 so just flip it 180 degrees around.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592 If you can add this one, you turn it like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761 Then lift the other side down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490 Because maybe your hand is in the way if you put this right here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207860_0207900 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208151_0208188 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288 start on a blank page.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509 Here, this way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175 and we can... a little bit up here...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421 Just that square left.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958 and then the rest of the business.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498 Yes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344 A little bit more friendly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215951_0216031 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423 That's what it was.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512 We've got a general idea of the concepts and materials we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081 So now for the next meeting we'll have to look at the fuel design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575 It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819 So check out the corporate website maybe.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286 The user interface design is the same, sorry.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527 and product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198 So the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771 but you're going to get your instructions I think send them to bloody coach
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642 I will put these minutes in the folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0221860_0223007 En dan gaan we het project eindigen en een goed ontwerp maken voor alle ouders en ouders.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394 Let me turn it. That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233 I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361 and then you'll get a message.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778 Så lidt så. Det er sgu ikke.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026 Maybe this one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240 Okay, safe as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225592_0225685 for this group.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653 All right, let's see here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788 Smart boy. There it is.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235 So if you want to look at it, it's over there in the project folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764 And then I guess we'll start in 30 minutes again.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227926_0228011 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943 Mm-hmm.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237 some research about designing of interface
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969 In de laatste meting hebben we een paar bieten gebruikt.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534 So that's what I want to...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088 through our design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675 It's a very attractive way to control the remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406 I found something about speech recognition.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725 So maybe we can use that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241 and using a little display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584 So um, find.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263 Just to focus on the primary functions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0052279_0053386 So only a button for sound for on off, shifting up channel or down shifting down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0054053_0055076 We hebben nog wat nieuwe en attractieve functies nodig die mensen voor het gebruiken attractief zijn.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904 So it's like a speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247 just as we mentioned last meeting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736 And yeah, no for all, you're so friendly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079 Dus gebruik de grote knoppen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127 It's possible to make a quite cheap system for speech recognition.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078 When you lost your remote control you can call it and it will give you a signal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059355_0060394 and for shifting up a channel or for putting out the sound or something
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972 you can just give a sign say sound off or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248 and uh...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666 television
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061979_0062017 See you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062017_0062107 Yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754 I was thinking about a special button for subtitles. Just one button to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187 Als je een push op de knop heeft, krijg je kleine zet tijden.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204 Double push, push, double click. So you get big subtitles for people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965 Hoe kan je een klein stukje tekenen?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167 So
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977 Ja, we moeten de beton in het generel houden.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608 the on and off, sound on and off, sound higher and lower and the numbers 0 to 9
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499 the general button, more general, one button for shifting down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0067499_0068547 Also we want to use a little display for displaying the functions of the buttons.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546 We kunnen een functie bouwen die de TV-channel of de TV-channel laten zien.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161 so
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824 Just, we can put on off button over here in this corner.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571 Bijna alle remote-controle gebruiken we daar een half-button op.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271 So people will recognize the button.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416 So.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043 display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312 Again, put it on top of the...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615 It's the most
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199 Places en mensen hebben veel luxe.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041 So special button for shifting up and shifting down channel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585 Deze is een van de meest opgelezen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038 So you can easily shift up or shift down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404 And it's quite a...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077560_0077623 any place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316 and other functions for subtitles, one with sound.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304 En overal, design, we moeten het over het vormen van het.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573 And that's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0103973_0104066 What's the function?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374 for loading up the batteries.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104502_0104541 We hebben het.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864 I won't use much energy I believe.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811 Het is een klein display, dus ik denk dat het 6 maanden of meer op 1 batterij gaat.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293 So I believe one battery is just enough.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0107293_0107332 So.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0109111_0109182 place
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0122010_0123074 Maar we hebben hier een grote LCD-display of een kleine die we willen gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359 I don't know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497 Is it possible to make a changeable case?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140497_0141783 So you got mobile phones, like Nokia mobile phones, when you can change the case of it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143 Maybe it's a possibility.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0142143_0143382 So you have just to make one standard remote control and you can sell a few.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139 We can just use the regular form of it, but it's not quite fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0162139_0162213 So, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324 for left-handed users.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165576_0165671 Yeah, wait.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715 Het is mogelijk om het te programmen. Je hebt aan de rechterkant de knoppen om de banden te schiften.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669 en op de andere kant de knoppen om de geluid te schiften
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929 Um.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0168784_0168851 is a fuse.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0171079_0171166 Yeah, but...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825 or you have to make a left connective.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980 I mean, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0174074_0174165 Yeah, you've...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0181030_0181088 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486 Just using a...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687 Ja.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832 Yeah. Building them.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195579_0195663 This is what I'm testing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040 You say it's um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430 .
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266 You got like a circle there.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849 So you want to put this way over here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953 No.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945 now it's upside down
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055 です
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194 That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199194_0199283 Okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043 maybe it's possible to make this side like
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428 Oh
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425 to make this site.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850 Welcome.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217 So in the form of your hands
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202217_0202304 So, uh...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202446_0202545 That's...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157 So the remote controller has to lay in your hands.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536 So it's possible.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151 And the buttons for the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620 Changing the channel over here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644 So just flip it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150 table display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060 What is it? I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061 like on your mobile phone
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875 I've made
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463 Maar de ander af en buiten, stil onnie top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0002409_0002464 Especially.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300 I'll start off that pretty good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995 I'm going to inform you about the trend watching I've done over the past few days.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224 We've done some market research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610 Can you distribute it some more on kids? Questionnaires?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021670_0022728 Besides that, I deployed some trend watchers to Milan and Paris to get a hold of the newest trends.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525 and I've consulted some additional trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088 the best design would be.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509 Okay, these are some overall findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960 The most important thing is the fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462 The research indicated that that was by far the most important factor.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239 Innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776 By no-fittness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controllers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839 About half of the important things, the innovativeness was easy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0027839_0029193 For our group we're focusing on, the people of 60 to 80 years old, these factors are slightly more equal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830 These are some more group-specific findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102 All the people prefer dark colors.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533 They like recognizable shapes and familiar material.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093 Our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633 the material for older people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031633_0032764 Mae'r ffyniad hwn yn rhoi'r amser am y ffyniad y mae'r ffyniad yn ei wneud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520 Mae'n mynd i ni i ddod o ffyrdd perfformiol.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933 the remote control and docking station should blend in
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226 In the room.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797 Felly dyma'r adeiladau'n llwybr.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557 just keep it simple and, well, docking station on the small screen would be your main points of interest.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270 because this would be the, this would be the innovativeness in the remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896 So this would be very important that we at least include these features.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036896_0037901 Yn ymwneud â'r cyhoedd, rwy'n gweithio'r cyhoedd yn ymwneud â'r gwirionedd a'r stafion ddechrau yn ddechrau'n ffyrdd.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470 So you could imagine that the remote control would be standing up straight in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085 This is pretty much a new shape to older people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958 Also, they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170 So it would be kind of more telephone-shaped.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0040266_0041314 Besides that, we would advise to bring two editions, one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel, and one with a grey-black colour.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809 who would like for more exclusive people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998 people with more money.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227 The great black color for...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730 People of less means.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203 There would be.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043635_0043711 y triw.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370 and how exactly does the kinetic energy work?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100370_0100424 Just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747 your remote and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706 Well, personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499 and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267 And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559 get great popularity for a product.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007 um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196 Yeah, you could load up batteries, you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720 It was true. Elderly people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954 I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557 because in our earlier market research, if you'd allow me to.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235 So, it's open here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594 We also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369 if people would pay more for speed recognition and no remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827 Well, you can see here our darker group would not do that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229 So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote controller.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667 Rwy'n hoffi'n ddiddordeb yn dda i'w wneud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175 I think it would be better to insert in our other product that is meant for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0118321_0118391 younger people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924 Well, this is, yeah, but this is, here the question was would you prefer it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250 So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970 And on top of that, the LCD screen would help in making the remote control easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773 and I think the voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744 Well this was for like an LCD screen like you would have on a mobile phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971 So pretty large.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803 I think the most important factor there is the wooden color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136 So it would actually have to be with, yeah, it's just.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0138485_0138558 Ooh, the color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574 you get a greater advantage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670 We would have to look carefully into the design though.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517 because we would have to make one more control which would fit in with a wooden cover and
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798 plastic cover.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184 I wish you could try to take a look.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094 Well, no, I think we should just we should then just design one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867 one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305 So, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151 I heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curve.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312 Could you explain it a little more?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954 and what would single curves and double curves mean?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539 So we can pretty much just pick one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156788_0156823 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967 Nid, i ddod yn ystod.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229 the cover of the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889 وراء البشاية
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200 You said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you can...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156 so your thumb would be easily... Well, I think that's a very good point because I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause RSI.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342 So it would be great for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900 I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355 for left-handed users.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860 Mm.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985 Well, look.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721 Yeah, we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy use
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0169396_0170527 But if we would make changing channels and changing volume button on both sides, that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940 because it could be made all symmetrical and stuff.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0171552_0171617 That is true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0183930_0184002 That's true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919 I prefer the corners to be round.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215101_0215191 I think that would be better.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215435_0215516 I'm the only one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0227946_0227988 Okay, good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318 Well, this is what me and Richard came up with.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630 the default spot for the on off button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914 the new button just below that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143 Then there's the volume and channel selectors.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651 simple plus minus
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832 We thought of a help button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459 If you hold it and you press another button the help goes to the LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006 Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210 button for teletext
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412 I'm looking for the subtitles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547 and the company logo.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108 So it's rather simple prototype.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509 And we'll have to see from testing how the users take it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603 Sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857 I think if you look at
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312 most controls they've got more buttons than this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651 Well, the on-off button is a necessity.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827 Can you open up that one?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305 volume en channel buttons, je hoeft niet die te doen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014 The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295 So we could cancel that one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198 I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796 Well, we can't.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107 I'll leave out the number buttons, I guess.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775 So it's rather basic already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707 Yeah, there is no more plan.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038707_0039817 They're supposed to be equal sized with a little logo on it for the volume.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922 It's just a recognition.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860 So for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160 with a different colour than the case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326 So they jump out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672 Okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531 And that's a big cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589 If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402 which isn't the docking station isn't even in this schematic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799 No, it's not even taken into the press.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439 You could save money on it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909 but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432 My mother can't even send an SMS message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716 The margins are getting too small.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859 No any other
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608 You could just not scroll for half a second.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041 If you want to use an LCD screen you need an advanced chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942 Yeah, if you click just leave out one more button
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104845_0104933 Uh, yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706 What if you have to scroll to page 88?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015 888.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125 You could wake two buttons out of that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299 and just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820 If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160 So that would save two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291 if you do the same for the channel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0125541_0125614 More obvious.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0127499_0127588 So if we try...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190 Als we de buttons niet meer laten, kunnen we misschien met de vlakke kast gaan.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350 and make it smaller overall.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493 So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button, the screen right under that, then the scroll button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801 you'll get a much smaller remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131028_0131056 and
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171 Richard argument. All these changes are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0173211_0173289 the LL5.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147 I haven't thought of that one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014 I think that's a free.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412 I think it's too fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585 to do the actual.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806 Is this, like, after this will be done or?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0199991_0200038 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434 Yeah, there wasn't enough room for the finance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207148_0207215 Yes, it was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687 The tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step and it's very easy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414 The drawing is just a painting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773 It didn't look bad, it's very nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110 flip over more precisely.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0214261_0214361 Yeah, it's a lot of stress.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0217626_0217690 Good work.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023 considering we are not going to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0002698_0002756 No problem.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551 It's supposed to be on a standard day.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665 It starts at 3 o'clock.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450 are fourth and last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004774_0004870 There he is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801 It is our last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236 In this meeting we will discuss our final design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073 and we will do some evaluation about not only the product but also the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473 And then we're going to close the project today as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027 so after that you'll be free to go and spend all your money
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951 Dit is een detail design meeting. We gaan over de look en de gevoel van het design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616 De usability interface design en we doen de product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053 In order to go to this agenda.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431 We will have the prototype presentation first.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847 Then we will set up some evaluation criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128 Then we will look at the finance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851 We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264 Everything costs money and the more features you want to have the more money it will cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897 So we have to see if it fits within the 12.5 euro per remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106 We will see that later.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608 Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797 We've got 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313 So we will be finished at half past three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458 But first,
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059 We will do the prototype presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536 So some attributes for it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033 But I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364 Just a few buttons and large buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914 But I think these are all together quite a few buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558 I'm wondering if we really need all of those buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0030283_0030338 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0034073_0034143 Right, food.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567 I don't know. They should subtitles. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300 Sorry, I had somebody but there's something about the design of the buttons there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660 It's normal for a world.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042770_0042859 It's not.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583 the customer we have 30 minutes left. I will move on to the finance part.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103 which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we want to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313 And I can tell you...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184 We're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12.5 euros.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093 if we see... I don't know if I filled in correctly so just correct me if you see something wrong
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275 I got two batteries.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449 But maybe we can also use one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571 I don't know if it's supposed to be true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046688_0046778 Let's reach out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046778_0046829 the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569 It's still your result.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771 We need the advance chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964 So they're out in the chute.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445 Save there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674 Here we have the single curves.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330 We kunnen zien dat de verschil tussen ongeheurd en een enkelheurd is 1 euro.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0049567_0050630 I don't know, but I think the single curve is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771 I think we have to keep it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207 Then we have the case material supplements.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051207_0051288 It's plastic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551 It's the cheapest one we need.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892 So that's not much to say either.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253 But then the biggest cost are the buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124 So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our calls low.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846 oherwydd byddwn yn rhaid i'w gael 12.5 euro yn y ddau.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498 So let's first go on the buttons we have now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741 16.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171 That will be even more than.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282 Anything to do with us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363 Okay, including the health?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973 I think we can discard the help and the mute button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577 by pressing down volume or pressing down a number.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157 Dat zegt dat ze lang hier wel alweer...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347 Dus dan is het ook 15.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058911_0059003 And this is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638 No, that's your one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761 Yeah, but it's not stated in this. It's just a...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582 So maybe we can even make one button with the volume and channel in one by pressing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189 that's a possibility as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747 So and it's good for the design as well
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063747_0063844 so you can make
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373 You made this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283 Looks good right there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604 Cross.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938 It's cheaper.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067938_0067994 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755 I think they count the material.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434 on the chip there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069640_0069710 uh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069710_0069759 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476 But I think because we have the advantage, we can just count this as one bit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612 But not with that thing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110 Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get itself in half euros.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807 Also the LCD display. I think it's too expensive for the display we use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166 I think they tried.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535 That's right, what's the biggest advantage of our remote then?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858 taken into the press.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075858_0075946 That's the extra.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075946_0075992 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577 That's an option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108 close
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625 Don't you think we can, if we can count this as one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335 and integrate these buttons in 3. That saves a lot of money as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0079648_0079729 It's okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216 Yeah, but we have to stick with it till often all of you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758 We don't have any more budget. The margin has to be small.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085451_0085521 It is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913 If you would be able to see the display.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188 And if you use less buttons...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824 I can't use...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445 There it is. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876 It didn't.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0088391_0088466 Right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850 Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n ddifrifol hefyd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606 Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091774_0091815 for this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155 Cause that's not... We save...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604 So, five, four, three, two, one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797 See.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454 감사합니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956 Maybe you can...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416 scroll
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856 If you scroll you will see the numbers on the LCD display.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061 You tell your head of the right number, then you push it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800 It's cool to push buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289 Okay, but then you can push some other business.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097773_0097811 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288 you wait a half second
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412 Mae'n fwy fwy o bwysau.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634 And we need better...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440 And the regular chip is not possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541 Het is de biert van.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028 You need an advanced chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674 Now we can save a euro by a flat design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510 That's an option we can... Then we're almost there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103221_0103313 So if we...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097 Yeah, but I think that is a big advantage.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780 Can we integrate the data text and the subtitles in one button?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181 Thank you pretty much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035 That could be.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0110185_0111458 Ik denk dat als je een goed advertentie maakt op tv en in de guide, je kunt de mensen uitleggen hoe ze de schoorwiel gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738 Just make it real simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275 It saves a lot of money.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622 and we can keep our LCD screen which can provide extra information.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798 a sut ydych chi'n gweithio ar y ddwylo?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097 I think it was the only group that was S, the titles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870 Dit is goed voor de innovative design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054 If you would erase these.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455 .
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936 And that's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970 It looks a bit off, maybe.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0118202_0118283 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389 Something like that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627 And yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119627_0119725 Okay, scroll down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659 E aí
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704 That's really a good idea, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742 And that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440 So we make one volume of the signal.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540 So if you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127540_0127616 Right?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873 So we go one, two, three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246 Yeah, we can leave the data text in if we want.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484 That's my show today.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0129528_0129580 So if you put...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130183_0130236 Yeah, it's really good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130848_0130903 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131141_0131200 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599 I'm going to praise this one too.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0132777_0132865 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891 It's more the molds in which they are being made, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149 Single current is really easy to just fill in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440 and then the case is gone right out of the machine.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932 and seeing the creatures and different machines and then reflect on them.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349 I think this is a really easy one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204 What does everybody think about a flap or a single curve design?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368 Great.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976 Yes, it gets close.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138075_0138134 Yeah, I know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138448_0138544 Get us to speed.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061 We're gonna do some work and research.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867 But I think we can keep the single-carat one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423 just to express our LCD screen a bit more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234 Some people will use it more, especially for the help functions. It will be good if we have a scroll bar, scroll button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583 It will be necessary to have a good count function as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553 So.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030 I think it was better to have this price a bit earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412 Yes, definitely.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852 I think we have a good make a bit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487 That's pretty different.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0146301_0146358 to get the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692 So we're gonna...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147824_0147921 I think the most
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713 ...en zo.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057 Maybe we can stick it out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480 Like an old, old button. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709 Maybe that's recognizable for them as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882 That's a good one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380 So, I'm afraid we have to move on.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789 It's less frightening, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461 If they see this design and think of only five buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0151710_0151804 It didn't get like one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752 I would buy it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182 I would buy a different seat.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583 I'd have guessed it ended up in all of your eyes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939 Yes, they are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590 that we can go with the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185 Okay, sit down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519 We still have 15 minutes left, so nice and scheduled.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017 The project process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654 Evaluation of the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0156703 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972 Dat was de dingy, dat point, ik vergat het.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157073_0157148 Shit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416 There we go.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406 We hebben vijf minuten, denk ik. Dan gaan we beginnen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595 No, we've got 15 minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0159654_0159733 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0160899_0160939 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947 Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload this data.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409 ‫אני קורא, ‫אבל זה נגיד שמורי, ‫אבל אני לא אהבר.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151 I think it's Vincent.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912 Subtitles...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763 So we've got 20 cents for our docking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172007_0172054 It's
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577 It's a bit dodgy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279 I would say four or five.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431 Four or five. Four.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173431_0173528 between.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0174139_0174236 Where is it's function?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410 I think it's seven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373 Mais bolas.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514 I have been worked out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276 They are ugly, not very functional and getting lost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496 I think with the new radio button, I think it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180601_0180679 I think it's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0181167_0181228 지금
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495 That would give us four.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543 Then we have to do it in three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737 Evet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657 They want to put fashion in their products.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820 in the slogan of the company.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250 I think we have the removable front cases.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526 Felly, dwi'n credu bod hynny'n bwysig.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302 We've got to go.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159 Rydyn ni'n mynd i'r ffordd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159 9-4, I'm 39.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0191694_0191750 What do you want?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723 80%
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192723_0192769 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734 That's 84%.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531 I think that's a pretty nice score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196264_0196309 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091 That brings us to the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969 Project process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284 Did we move through the right faces, you think?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0198284_0198384 long process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199215_0199260 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792 So lack of information about prices.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462 Also room for creativity.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171 It's because of the finance issue.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519 The rumors, yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092 Internet access.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292 Was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819 Did it work out?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206819_0206916 working together.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281 Also, you do a few with the... Yeah, it was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665 were the main sufficient for the tasks that we had to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854 or really too much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210536_0210617 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227 if it wants to download this data.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923 .
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719 Smart boys was irritating.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663 So you rather want to have a flip over.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862 or something like that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403 Fostering as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214952_0215006 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117 Je hebt de Smartboard applicatie nodig.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463 But I think...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606 That should be close enough.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760 Yeah, you can export this image.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036 West.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673 So the sharing of information was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141 Ja, ik ben eens hier aan de tijden.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0221553_0221616 it's possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383 Have we found new ideas for...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719 Having this kind of meetings.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853 So everybody puts his own score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438 Yeah. It mediates the score. Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629 That's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773 So it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226902_0226980 That'd be cool.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875 Any more ideas?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035 questions about the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187 or about the product.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027 It goes, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842 And as we get to our last sheet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225 Articles in the budget
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759 considering we are not
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184 W-stage.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323 That's a good boy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942 Maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459 And I think you can compensate that as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053 So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536 Do we think we're gonna get the 12 and all million?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728 How old was he? 15.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002 Christine, Christine Miller.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226 I think he will.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421 Are you going to exploit this product?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631 Ja, in overte.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796 especially in America.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996 People are, they could have.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923 even more for the younger people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789 Just put it on the market for everybody.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421 You can change markets by changing the flow of coffee.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648 That's one thing you can change.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492 So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy colors on the mark.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596 just as a test.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780 See how it works.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960 That's why I think it's fun.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889 Then I think we can have a little celebration.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243008_0243104 Party, party.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641 I think we still have some credit more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243641_0243727 I see.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243727_0243778 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907 I didn't get the message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644 from the ending of the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766 Five more minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244766_0244857 Let's go.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441 Then we still have some questions.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777 If somebody has some questions, they can ask them now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188 We can put these in the project folder as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0246188_0246256 Mm-hmm.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137 Picture, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996 This is another.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380 So, what do you say? Project cooler?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0251380_0251450 I did.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252084_0252182 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073 Ik denk dat ik nu mijn laatste presentatie ga maken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994 I'll be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292 summary of the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455 I think you all have got the question in your room.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867 and then I'll meet you in, I think, about 10 minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257911_0257969 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676 Ik hoop dat mijn pen deze software downloadt.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258798_0258869 for a few minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520 Dat is gewoon de normale remote controles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092 You push it, you come in page 100.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492 Je kunt de normale 120-buttons gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251 You can also use the button for changing the channel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597 De schifting bedden.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145 voor shifting up in the deltxt and shifting down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0028020_0028081 Interesting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0032664_0032723 because
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076 Or you can build it when you press one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430 We just discussed it already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841 maar we denken dat alle mensen die optie niet weten.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336 so they just put in the press the bed on.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0036106_0036142 Mm-hmm.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0038595_0038650 아
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039621_0039712 Try it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870 just to recognize it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252 And we don't need LED or LED.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216 Sommige remote controles hebben dat ook, maar omdat we het kleine display gebruiken, moeten we het niet gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353 Yeah, so...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989 Yeah, we can use it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640 Sixth number.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055647_0055737 15
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074 Yeah, with the outfit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059797_0059890 I think there are two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170 See on vain kõik.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336 bit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809 to one big boom
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278 but they are more expensive than the small ones.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447 I
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922 It's just a reference.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814 But I don't know if it's cheaper.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508 So we still got four buttons but just so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393 You got not a better itself, but on the chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825 the chip you've got still for business.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0070187_0070270 Yeah, but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323 We can buy a remote control when you can use it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080323_0080403 So.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080795_0081905 We must stay below 12.50.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675 This is supposed to be small.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308 It is possible to make one for 1250.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0085405_0085486 I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769 but I can't use...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698 Do you want to make a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326 Fancy en...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709 with the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083 attractive options.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571 dus je kunt blijven onder 1250
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862 Let's go to this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091964_0092017 that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0102171_0102209 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643 Of we moeten de subtitel afschuiven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896 I think that's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203 Yes, big branches.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445 But it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104854_0104924 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420 Maar als je 30 punten twijt.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106593_0106649 the page eight.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180 أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه، أه،
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0130811_0130845 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737 But you can make a quite big remote control for just the same price as a small one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154 You only have to pay for the double curve or single curve.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0144166_0144215 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245 But they know the scroll buttons from old radios.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690 Also buttons like that for changing channels.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848 En misschien is het...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341 That's very special.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0169428_0169515 You'll go to San Diego.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172293_0172354 There it is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113 I would say...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379 Four or five. Four or five.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0174813_0174866 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045 There's that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054 That's a free.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961 We have to test it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151 네, 그렇죠.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0183216_0183313 Think of the tree.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0184600_0184659 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0198655_0198706 I think we should.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034 for a more precise
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998 But if you want to share a picture like this on the presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302 it's easier to share it with other people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688 So you can save it and put it on the internet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321 or in shared folder or shared directory.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617 to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571 Can you export it like a... Should be possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221557_0221619 possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0222830_0223899 Yeah, maybe. Just give the numbers of.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0224017_0225098 Het is een beetje makkelijker om dingen te doen als dat op de computer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564 So just like a university...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0232341_0232375 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0243410_0243496 E assiste bem!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498 أهبلك
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875 Maybe they will save it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252875_0252954 So.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986 Maybe we have to fill another question in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256986_0257044 Yeah, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765 Sorry I'm a little late.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891 Good second in traffic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337 Is this the moment where we ask, where we can ask questions about the question?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526 When you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just press it and you go to the next teletext page.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009 I think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127 That's what I pointed out earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580 If you just make a control for just the TV, there's just not much to gain.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624 Seems to be chargeable.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604 Удачи!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058664_0058737 This is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435 I assume the volume and channel thing is for two buttons each, right?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016 I think I see there are two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891 Well, I was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402 That would cut the cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849 I think this really is for buttons anyhow.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689 Only the docking station I guess.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247 Maybe we should move to a different supplier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213 ma è muore caldo
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340 Well, since the market research
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439 indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715 特elijk omdat we die mooie features hebben.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761 If you would be able to see the display.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089659_0089691 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089831_0090913 Basically it becomes a choice between either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017 But how would a scroll wheel work here?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447 that would bring up the price of the school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836 Push button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096836_0096923 But then you...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523 I think that would be like the end of our usability.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0099189_0099267 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892 I think it's pretty much teletext subtitles are right now. You just push the teletext button go to page 888. Yeah, and then the text disappears
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058 but the subtitles stay there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387 30.2
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498 I could be... Scroll to 8, click, scroll to 8, click, scroll to 8, click.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376 But then again, there would be just pretty much an option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108535_0108604 Holy God.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349 remote with which they expect to have like 10 buttons for the numbers 1 to 0.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761 Only five buttons on it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109976_0110054 And it's cool, dude.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143 It's a pretty big school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621 So this is five.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884 Right now we're fine.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803 Well, I still think we should go for the single-curve design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008 Yeah, then again, I'm really sorry.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451 All these changes are not really okay with me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601 but since...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137769_0137865 We just have to...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255 I'd rather just go to the board and...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782 Get us a $18 remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228 We're going to do some more research and see what the options are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362 It's pretty good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959 This is not really like for the group you were making.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152 This will really require a lot of marketing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482 to get this to sell.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297 because older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426 This is not familiar.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830 We're going to have to do a lot of convincing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151389_0151436 Das ist für Sie.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580 Might be confusing too.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151720_0151805 It could be like what?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906 Only five buttons?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944 but you're not 60.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394 So I like set up all these criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642 Evaluation of the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865 Okay, so I did some literature study, analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347 translated into criteria, which would be these.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584 Mae'n ffansi'n ffwrdd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756 shape looking film
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137 What new functions are on there?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162137_0162232 Easy to use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741 Learnability is a very important factor here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952 is functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317 are there not too many functions or the amount of functions
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740 and those functions in Darya, are they useful?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163740_0163825 and the cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164080_0164162 Target group.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617 Is the remote really for the group we're making it for?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998 and record mobility.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536 if our company is easily recognizable, our company made it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081 So we're supposed to evaluate it right now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166423_0166471 MBC 뉴스 김수근입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260 I have to say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0167371_0167425 The
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001 This is designed fancy on a scale of 1 to 7.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635 It's still going for six.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392 This is the design innovative.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929 Ik denk zo, of ja.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030 Should we do one? Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181 It's the design easy to use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172780_0172879 would be for us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0173579_0173666 Go for four, too.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438 is the design functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714 Do we have more functions that we want to include?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174849_0174943 I think we do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151 Do we have too many functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175151_0175235 No, I think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175235_0175320 Pretty sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990 Oh, then do we.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676 take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833 by getting lost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301 I haven't fought a cat one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0177301_0177351 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770 Production costs will increase at this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178770_0178849 Probably right now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698 Does the design fit the group of focus?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180138_0180230 I think with the new...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180815_0180879 de la société.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181091_0181152 I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034 I think the radio button is not exactly what older people expect of remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0182989_0183036 I'm not sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172 I think I feel the same.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632 Is de computer goed opgepakt?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139 So.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762 I was also supposed to calculate the score but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353 We've got the code.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785 Is this like after this will be done?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100 in that regard to tell you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189254_0189335 Why, huh?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567 These are sub-effectors, 107s for me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356 I'm gonna buy this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964 .
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191089_0191157 finish
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499 So maybe minus eight.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834 41.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134 I guess we'll just take the bottom part.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171 So that would be a flu.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145 I think we should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442 yn ddejau'n ffyrs.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0201763_0201840 Not too much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202278_0202335 Yeah, true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157 and I would have liked to go for the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420 younger users also.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833 and just to be able to access the internet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0204002_0204098 get something of your own.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573 I tried to open the file on my laptop but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217671_0217762 Not possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219000_0219096 You should have done that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219812_0219863 等著吃
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0232490_0232532 There.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767 50.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237264_0237626 Yeah, I still don't think... I mean, if we're gonna make a scroll button anyway...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244 It would be more for the younger people than for the older people. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405 So maybe we should just refocus.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004 specifically for younger people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0239502_0239563 That's true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758 Yeah, I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is, than it would be with
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0241921_0241996 with people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325 even if it were their covers.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121 Party, party.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0244479_0244521 You did.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0253017_0253106 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515 I know you're supposed to make
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688 Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0259069_0259156 Thank you, guys.
