AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0001232_0001522 So, show me. Talk about it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003404_0003804 Удачи
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003804_0004372 Oh, I dropped mine as well. Get at this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0004372_0004550 That wasn't a good start.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0014258_0014411 So that you can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0015240_0015280 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0019299_0019342 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0020774_0021798 I guess a button makes a bit more sense because otherwise you don't really know that, oh, what if I right click now? What happens then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0021798_0022021 Well, no, you still have the...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0022494_0022568 Small one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0023119_0023309 Like if you want to have more things
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0028511_0029029 I guess I mean it's more like part of the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029176_0029382 browsing sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029382_0029782 More than this Picard's third station, as Steve mentioned.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029782_0030242 Yeah, it's really nice to have you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033387_0033423 I
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033648_0034102 I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034102_0034749 Well, if you get to speak characterization, that someone talks a lot in a certain topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034749_0035495 And then if you click on that topic, you get everything that's in that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035495_0035633 I mean that's still another
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035885_0035950 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0047186_0047257 Like we have to, there were
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048370_0048684 like I don't know, show the speaker character station.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048684_0048784 Да, да, да
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0049626_0050203 But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0050347_0050518 そう私で
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0052255_0052654 Yeah, to do something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0053716_0053759 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054234_0054469 I'm guessing I'm going to zoom in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054629_0054823 Yeah, what you're cooking on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0056192_0056252 single child.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0064834_0065636 But well, couldn't we? I mean, you probably, I don't know if you want to have like the full transcription and the summary at the same time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0065756_0066343 So maybe you can just like choose the same window for transcription and summary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066792_0066942 Capsa'n i.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066942_0067089 Não tem a ver, tem um zela-estado.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067488_0067598 Did anybody know how to think?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067598_0067821 Can you do that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069530_0069723 or just i don't know but you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069723_0070329 Yeah, that might be changed to contents of the same window. Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0070453_0070496 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071598_0071661 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071661_0071729 we can do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071903_0072556 No, no, it could be like transcription summary. Yeah. Press on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0073967_0074082 I don't like it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0075387_0075484 any other specific
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0077778_0077821 Just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079078_0079370 Yeah, well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079370_0079997 But transcripts sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079997_0080387 like full meeting, meeting without disciplines and summer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0081037_0081143 Mm.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084663_0084719 Ok c'est le...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084719_0085603 I mean just to try and I mean for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing. Yeah that's what we need to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086073_0086473 Just so see the integration works.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086888_0087101 شاگی استاد خود بینیونت که مکنم
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088004_0088628 Well, I guess, I mean, that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088628_0088867 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0094981_0095082 Let's do that again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0097561_0097613 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099449_0099697 Can I tell you what I'm an SBT?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099998_0100130 So, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0100130_0101160 I basically started browsing a bit, just trying to see if there's anything out there to use.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101288_0101585 All the searching.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101585_0101685 We're getting ready for file stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101685_0101792 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101792_0102458 Okay, found a tutorial, but it inverted the search indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103281_0103473 Yeah, well, I don't know if it's useful.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103473_0103608 I could have a little bit.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103608_0104072 But I found some code for like a tutorial about indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104072_0104133 Come on, cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104458_0104529 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0105467_0105681 So you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106017_0106053 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106053_0106854 I was a bit worried about when he talked about this with the file.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106854_0107249 I mean, how much do they actually need to do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0107249_0107771 like extracting things from the XML files and stuff to be able to do the indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110119_0110483 Are you running in Jala?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110616_0110841 Felly mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud yma.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0113394_0114347 Yeah, I guess, I mean, it was a good point he had that like collaborating with Fowl things.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0114347_0114848 I mean if you are already starting on stuff, we can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115519_0115636 Should we?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115829_0115980 meet up and see what we get.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115980_0116747 I mean, I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of who we need, maybe.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0116747_0116842 week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0121416_0121534 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0122521_0122604 which would be possible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128171_0128615 But what happens is like a window where you have to write a search query.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128615_0128800 or is it just what's behind it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128800_0129035 No, this is not the actual
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0129035_0129151 such. This is just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0134560_0135831 When you like is there a open thingy or like what did you do to like how did you figure out that let's use the next search? Um is it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144448_0144493 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144867_0144899 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0149397_0149437 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0152324_0152410 of which
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0155807_0156044 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0156411_0156771 I'll be happy with this course.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0157437_0157493 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0159344_0159439 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0163914_0163954 I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166080_0166148 Please.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166778_0167381 The progress report is June 23rd of
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0167730_0167888 Uh...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0169920_0170266 Just looking at my own deadlines.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0170294_0170594 Um
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0172494_0172917 No
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0172917_0173184 Oh, that's that's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0173910_0174620 It's actually all these things that are next to me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175509_0175587 Boom.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175691_0175770 I know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175770_0175999 That's just so funny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175999_0176266 You can exist then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0179871_0180527 It would be nice to meet up and you can sort of show us a bit, you know, already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0180527_0180987 so we don't sort of have to do all the work again, just like figuring out stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0181391_0181684 Just like accessing the corpus and stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0185851_0185928 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0186513_0186630 Um
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0187051_0187192 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0188834_0188902 It's for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0190341_0190431 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0190431_0190658 necessary in the in the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0191051_0191105 Fando!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0191630_0191708 with this computer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0192242_0192775 I'll let us all in there and we can look at it. We can look now afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193805_0193935 into the computer world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193935_0194028 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0195765_0196060 We can photocopy your assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0196589_0196765 So what time do we save?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197137_0197220 after the event.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197331_0197709 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199088_0199348 Maybe it doesn't have...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199474_0199554 Sounds like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199554_0199647 Me too.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199647_0200193 Should we? Should we really? What? It's supposed to be next week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200193_0200308 It's a great week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200554_0200596 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200596_0201020 We have one class at least when we have a peace perception we don't have any.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201020_0201252 but I think I'm in like a lot of classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201252_0201545 I don't think there was
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202017_0202078 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202348_0202617 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'n meddwl.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202617_0203004 I think the undergirds had more of a...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204224_0204578 Yeah, we will probably have you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204578_0204860 Okay
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205048_0205523 Yeah. I guess.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205523_0205676 Was there anything else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205676_0206048 Do you want one? Why not? Like, take care of this one. Should I take care of it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206263_0206578 I don't know if there was something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206578_0206731 I can't be basically said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206959_0207489 the same things as in the comments if I could use it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0207601_0208075 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0208880_0209062 I'm thinking that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0209487_0209690 Oh, that was so crazy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210783_0210862 in terms of
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210996_0211532 And now we have 7% of the person.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211532_0211708 It's good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211708_0211786 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211914_0212391 You're okay with having...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213391_0213503 Third time now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213503_0213747 You
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213928_0214081 You should still here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0214081_0214159 Kiss you all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0000358_0000538 Yes, that's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001320_0001372 Çövünü
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001521_0002417 Once you just go around and everyone says what they've been doing. I said, we thought anything. No, what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0002417_0002522 Live.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003057_0003385 Well I've got a browser now, which, whoops.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003385_0003440 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005038_0005142 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005142_0005935 We've got a browser which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005935_0006681 And then when you go on the menu, you can select the summarization box, which pops up and an audio player.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0006879_0007304 ac yn ymddi'r cyfwyr yn ymddi'r cyfwyr, felly mae'n gwybod y cyfwyr.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007304_0007975 and it loads up just the background windows are empty and so when you start
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007975_0008475 mae'n cael ei wneud o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes o'r oes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008648_0008707 That makes sense.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008861_0009603 The transcription box has got a summarised button which doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0009603_0010391 Now, I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up window with the speaker characterisation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010620_0010958 Either we could do that, you know, when does the pop-up come?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010958_0011582 either we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0011582_0012313 Or we can put an extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you are actually in the transcription box.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012838 So you click on a button and then it opens and whatever that speaker characterization is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012838_0013481 Y problemau yw'r ysgolwch yn ymdweud oherwydd mae'n gwybod yw'r hyn yn ymdweud ymdweud.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0013662_0014263 that part of speech or whatever that what he's saying the left click highlights it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014263_0014755 I don't know what happens when you double click actually.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014755_0015291 That would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015291_0015579 Yn ymwneud, ond yw'r llwyddiad yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015579_0016074 mae'n ddweud ychydig i'r ddweud yma, fel y ddweud yma, sy'n ddweud yma.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016268_0016434 Felly, rydyn ni'n gwybod i'n meddwl.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016434_0016638 We could put it on a right click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016638_0016875 We could, for example, have a little menu that pops up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0017064_0017669 So right click on the menu and you can click on Speak for Characterization on the popsicle.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018003_0018170 That's a good point.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018170_0018296 하하
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018296_0018364 Otherwise
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018512_0019136 Yeah, but I don't know about you, but usually in Windows, right-click doesn't do anything, does it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019136_0019281 It opens a menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019281_0019509 Yeah, that's what anybody does.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019509_0019685 ..y'r ffordd y bydd y bydd wedi bod yn ystod.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019685_0019789 bringing that stuff in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0020464_0020661 or just, you know, or just the button.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0021828_0022161 Well no, you still have the menu. The menus pop up there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022303_0022415 Well, oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022415_0022683 It's more obvious, isn't it? It's more idiot-proof, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022781_0022916 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022916_0023124 That's true, yeah. More than just another second.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0023440_0023676 It's gonna be worse than your good things.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0024560_0025014 But this one is good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0025014_0026007 But actually what we should do is in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026135_0026438 I'd like a search for that user.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026438_0026635 Is that gonna be useful or too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0027270_0027918 Yeah, so when you right click on it, one option will be give me all your meetings, characterise the speaker.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0028408_0028527 Was that too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0029777_0029908 Yeah, it's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030101_0030163 Yes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030163_0030404 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031661_0031855 What do you mean by the speaker characterization?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031855_0031976 Oh well, yeah I mean.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032138_0032239 I don't know about that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032239_0032507 I mean, the speaker characterisation is a bit like he said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032507_0032731 I mean, it's like a nice thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032731_0033237 We don't, I'm not actually sure what the user wants from it, but it's interesting, so why not give it to him?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033408_0033513 I think we should do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033513_0033555 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035475_0035713 Yeah, I mean that's still another level further.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035713_0035849 I mean, we're not even there yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035849_0036132 No, no, no, no. Doesn't even pop up the speaker characterization yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036132_0036419 We have to first define what happens when you click on a user.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036933_0037201 So should we try to do a right click menu then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0038786_0039120 Yeah, there's a second thing about the topics the topic window
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039120_0039859 you want to somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039955_0040278 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'r ffordd yn y ffordd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040278_0040500 So this is for
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040963_0041128 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0041128_0042077 So we have basically two options of browsing the meetings is by either searching and opening individual observations.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0042077_0042413 and then we have the interlinking by right click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0043540_0043601 I will think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0046279_0046699 I didn't say there was anything obvious that would be able to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0048635_0049016 But then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0049016_0049385 and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050231_0050320 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050661_0051319 Don't tell me that. I'll let me close it. Yeah, it's nothing to the world. Especially if you're a touch pad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051319_0051763 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051763_0052198 I'll check what it does on double click at the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052198_0052354 because I think it would be good to do something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052354_0053059 But I don't really see anything obvious there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0053232_0053373 I mean, if you can think of something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0054942_0055367 um yeah nothing
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055367_0055554 single audio files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055554_0055657 то я вам не езжу
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056175_0056388 Yeah, single channel, single channel files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056388_0056482 still we want them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056482_0056539 I mean.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056935_0057083 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0057083_0057836 We might use them at the moment to work with them, but do we want to integrate them so that when you browse you can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058138_0058175 Do you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058175_0058529 He's not gonna make much sense if you listen to it on its own, do you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058529_0058566 less.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0059290_0059432 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061004_0061410 Yeah, what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that you mentioned?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061410_0061622 Do you think? I think we probably know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061802_0062025 We need to have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0062025_0062566 I mean I remember very much I wouldn't have everything customisable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063100_0063186 I'm not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063271_0063546 Two, three baby.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063546_0063967 But yeah, it depends. I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063967_0064139 And the summary, for example, is typically
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064139_0064653 you open the window, you re-throw it, you might close it again straight away.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064653_0064783 Baby good times.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0066465_0066707 There's my stuff here too.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067015_0067093 זה לסתם
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067093_0067298 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067298_0067356 That's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067356_0067509 I'm not sure, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067774_0067816 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067816_0068028 Maybe he probably can't.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068028_0068145 I'm sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068145_0068259 I'm sure you can do anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069193_0069280 I can have a look.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069694_0069876 But yeah, that might be changed.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074042_0074793 Felly mae'n gweithio i gael ymlaen, mae'n gweithio i gael y windows, o'r lluniau yn y lluniau. Mae'n gweithio i gael y windows.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074793_0074870 to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075637_0075770 Yeah, you can't do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075770_0075825 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0076972_0077180 Yeah, that's what they're doing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077312_0077525 Yeah, they're definitely gonna be in the same one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077961_0078225 Yeah, that was a plan for the dyspheresis anyway.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078225_0078273 So
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078405_0078674 Yeah, do you want to do that with some reason?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078674_0078914 put the saris in the same way now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0079024_0079145 me sure he's gonna say something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0080411_0080636 Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to do that? That would make sense. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0081658_0082025 And finally, the prototype he spoke about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082025_0082238 What kind of prototype could be produced?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082427_0082876 Because I'm just, you know, we're going to the lab and I say, what am I going to change today?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082876_0082966 You know?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082966_0083521 And it kind of just, it just develops. I'm not aiming for anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0083521_0083648 Do we want to answer sometimes?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084151_0084417 I'm pretty much getting there anyway, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084417_0084676 It's not going to be a long one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0086512_0086575 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0087635_0087724 No words.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090041_0090334 Like if we're gonna just try like take a look or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090334_0090526 I don't know if you can answer some people's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091245_0091452 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091452_0091735 I don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can show it to me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092632_0092884 Right, well I'll make that readable then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092884_0093251 So the directory is my number.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093469_0093781 Well, this is not too bad. We'll see you in a minute though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093781_0093953 In all the emails.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093953_0094325 Your number.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094325_0094677 A4, 5.5.5.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094852_0094906 Six times.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095076_0095254 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8,
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095493_0095832 And then there's a folder in LSSD.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095954_0096182 and it's called the M browser.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0096372_0096633 We're eating.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097137_0097408 No, I'm extremely old now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097408_0097519 I've got a cold, sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097519_0097586 I love you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098653_0098772 Yeah, so that's me doing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098772_0098929 Someone else might talk about this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101141_0101294 What were you doing again?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101518_0101603 Yes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103010_0103097 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103097_0103239 He found some clothes for it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103796_0103892 of the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0104071_0104139 Come on, cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105314_0105391 Ja, fan.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105647_0105801 So you think it shouldn't be too difficult?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107796_0107929 Oh, I see.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107984_0108254 I have to convert it to some sort of format.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0110673_0111508 Rwy'n meddwl ychydig i'r cerdd brosol, ond yw'r cyfnod yn ymdweud, ond yw'r cyfnod yn ymdweud.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0111508_0111638 I'm sure they do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117526_0117565 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117565_0117771 This week's only two days old.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119772_0119940 Yn y fawr, mae'r cyfnod yn ymdweud.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119940_0120083 But it was.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0120083_0120184 I just said that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122509_0122961 Well, the browsers I use it now are as I know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122961_0124017 It was there when I took it. It uses the NXT search to get the data out of the files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124017_0124283 Ac rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl yw'r cyffredin.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124283_0124371 I don't quite understand.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124736_0125544 To get the data, for example, to get summarization data, you have to search for, I think, the IDs on something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0126372_0126907 So they don't, you know, they don't say, look in that and that folder, but they say, search everything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127599_0127915 It does make that quite creepy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127915_0128090 It's not so bad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128090_0128300 But you know, but what have I said like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128916_0129092 No, this is not the actual search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129092_0129792 This is just when you open, you know, to load the transcript, for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129792_0130668 It does, I don't know, search for the string, I don't know, transcript or text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0131325_0132073 Yeah, so I don't know if you've looked at the search query language but it's like a dollar, a text.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132517_0132635 And then, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132635_0133008 because every year all of these
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133146_0133367 Felly, mae'n gwybod yn ymddi.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133367_0133778 and all the transcript files got the string. I don't know what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133778_0134161 words or text or something in it. So just search us for those files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0135749_0136115 Um, is it? Um, well, it's in the code.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136115_0136646 just that you define a search object and then you search that string.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136646_0136971 how to figure out how to do the same thing for the summer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136971_0137045 That's not why.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137199_0137656 Felly, yna'r ffordd yng Nghymru, yng Nghymru, yng Nghymru, yng Nghymru.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137932_0138302 Yeah, just search for specific strings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0138539_0139209 So you could just use that if you want to take the data out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0139668_0140326 If you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want to...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140326_0140557 you know, whatever you want to do, then just send me an email.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140684_0140767 I can explain.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141071_0141221 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141221_0141861 Actually in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the the browser that I used from this from you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141861_0142167 that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142167_0142569 a ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddodd yn ddod
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142569_0142648 감사합니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142891_0143171 So they're really in that yet. Still.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143171_0143597 a lot of rubbish but we'll be chucked out at the end I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143975_0144143 Yeah. Can't get rid of that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145448_0145854 Trisha, tell us the answer to that as we're making a vlog in the show.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145854_0146061 The weekend's still four days off.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0146751_0146953 I actually have that much to do at the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0147125_0147573 to explore any other.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148033_0148494 I can't remember what I'm supposed to do by the way.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148494_0148752 Am I supposed to do the summarization thingy about?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0149932_0150211 You do. Oh, really? You saw it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150211_0150300 Well, I'll do that then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150440_0150541 천천히 좀 놔.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150541_0150591 Come.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150701_0150793 Oh, if you want
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151237_0151324 Eşim de içeri.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151324_0151360 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152113_0152802 I'm doing communications of which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152802_0153029 That's in two weeks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153288_0153740 Yeah, it's a... I would play digital. Nine goals is okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153901_0154781 And then they're doing parallel programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well and that seemed like Friday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155035_0155705 Well I'm not doing any backhand things like that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155705_0155763 Please.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159233_0159403 Yeah, if you like.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159403_0159664 When we keep the sign.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159741_0159994 So, what are you planning to do over the weekend then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160140_0160327 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160327_0160522 I'm in the center.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0163891_0164297 I think we need to set ourselves some milestones, otherwise...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164485_0164537 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164782_0164907 behind schedule.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0166146_0166411 Bon, il a sauté là, je vais m'apprécier.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0167893_0168151 Well, how about we get it done by then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168151_0168188 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168444_0168972 then we can write about it in the interim report.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0170421_0170824 When the search interface
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171085_0171814 Maybe you should decide pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171814_0172395 And then if you want you can give that to me now. I'll build you nice, you know, a few tick boxes and drop down menus.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173031_0173365 Oh that's... that's a... that doesn't exist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173365_0173753 That was completely cut and pasted.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173753_0173939 That does not exist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173939_0174331 Nicely done, the woman. It's quite mesilistic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0174331_0175377 Because actually all these things are nicked from all these drop-down menus and tick boxes are nicked from Google and all that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175377_0175487 screenshot Google.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175679_0176358 That's not so much fun.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176358_0176565 It's gonna be a little bit more difficult.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176565_0177317 Yeah I mean I was going to but you know the whole drop down menus and stuff what we want to search for is not quite agreed on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177317_0177653 I never agreed on what we were going to be able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177980_0178441 Yeah, do you want to, you know, just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0178441_0178929 ac rydyn ni'n ddysgu'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio, o wneud yn ymwneud?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0179135_0179603 Mae'r bwysig yn ymddi'r llwyddiadau cwyrwyr yn ymddi'r llwyddiadau.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0181211_0181306 No already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183053_0183130 Yes, I know that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183247_0183443 Child Privates.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0184062_0184390 Oh yeah!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0184390_0184885 Ik wil het samen aan en ik zie je gaan zagen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0185631_0185865 Yeah, I was loving it for 2 hours.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0185987_0186047 something like that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186274_0186440 pick your time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186440_0186706 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186866_0187030 Och, Monday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0187030_0187079 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188099_0188231 3 o'clock?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188231_0188316 I should, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188886_0189228 Yeah, that's an option
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0189327_0189368 to help.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0190375_0190467 That's a show.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0191393_0191513 We can get in the 3D.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0191862_0191980 I'm not fan that yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0195773_0195858 Well done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196080_0196423 You got it on my computer?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196423_0196524 Well, the comments, I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196807_0196960 I just think it's better to do afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196960_0197135 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0197135_0197413 after due notice.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198623_0198860 Ychydig, mae'n ddweud i'r cyffernio.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198860_0199278 What? She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199278_0199452 Maybe it doesn't happen at all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199758_0199815 Is it really?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200409_0200538 I don't think we have a reading rate that...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200538_0200603 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0201280_0201698 I don't think there was an official one last semester
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0201698_0201870 I think it was just the back on, wasn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0204855_0204937 That's me, Monday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0211713_0211898 You need to be okay, but sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0213148_0213262 슈퍼는 잘 안 돼.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0000037_0000174 I wonder how much of the music

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022508_0022651 It's more idiot proof, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022651_0023204 Let's get a button. Yeah, yeah. That's true. Yeah, more interesting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0023462_0023539 That would be worse than this.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0146991_0148409 Well, should you play the hit one to explore any other? How's your, um, Contamara raising?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0150042_0150192 You saw it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0151690_0152141 Yn y cwrs, yw'n ddweud yw'r cyffredin.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0174055_0174256 Yes, it's quite messy, Missy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0175667_0176204 That's not funny.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0177660_0177739 Nice.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0182306_0182820 You can take a search tutorial or like the other class paths, all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0183594_0183865 Next week's hospital.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0187312_0187486 night.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188355_0188627 Yn ymwneud, mae'r ddweud yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188627_0188749 It was one time stand.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188749_0188825 forward.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189592_0189678 드레이스 겟다
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189678_0189903 But we haven't thought about it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189903_0190011 Mae'r ddweud yn gwlad i'r ffa.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0190469_0191133 330 in the computer room in here. We just can't get in there though. Can't you get in the front door?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191133_0191290 O, yw'r unrhyw gwybod, yn ymgyrch?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191290_0191374 Can none of you get it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191580_0192089 Mae'r ddweud o'r rhan o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r dd
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192089_0192700 Well if you find me I'll show you where our letters all in there and we can look at it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192700_0192791 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192791_0192913 You do need to have a key for it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192913_0192972 I just think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192972_0193082 It's going to knock the whole back.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0193221_0193326 Yeah, somebody else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194037_0194480 Felly mae'r cyfnod, mae'r cyfnod yn 4 o 5 cyfnod, ond mae'n gwybod bod yn fwy gwybod yn fwy gwybod.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194480_0194796 because Kenosemera is not very obnominating with people.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194976_0195055 Yeah, that's for sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195055_0195472 Ac mae'r ffordd yn ymddi, yn ymddi'r llwy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195472_0195877 Well done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197101_0197132 All right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197316_0197367 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0198132_0198470 Hopefully it's not that man's, it won't matter.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202080_0202399 Some classes didn't, some classes didn't.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202399_0202522 It's gonna be.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202522_0202670 I think they really know what was going on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0203437_0203591 Yeah, I think what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0206074_0206171 Oh, wait, trust me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209644_0209866 Yn y cwmysgwch yma yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0209866_0209900 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212177_0212273 I'm expecting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212600_0212704 signing off
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212704_0212767 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0000096_0000665 I wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff the meetings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002147_0002311 No, what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002707_0002820 Sounds like you've done this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0019845_0020242 Ie, mae'n ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023050_0023188 The women's analysis is critical.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023188_0023463 Like if you want to add more things in the future, then we'll need buttons.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023463_0023492 have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023492_0023804 Where's it then? I think it's more flexible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023804_0024042 Well, I guess
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024287_0024381 You can have a
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024381_0024516 Anyway, instead of a body
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024516_0024746 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030336_0030633 Yeah, they may be tied to doing with dialogue acts or something as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030633_0030899 speaker characterization.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030899_0031139 just some way to sort of leverage that information.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031139_0031547 like we have it, we're doing it the way I just hope the browsing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031547_0031789 or what can you give us?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0036844_0036914 That's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037629_0037844 That's not just from the main.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037844_0038530 Is that from any particular window? Like if we want to sort of get like if we're on the users versus like a topic or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0038530_0038786 Have a great day.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0039767_0039903 Right. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040228_0040305 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040426_0040582 That was an interesting throw.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040582_0040671 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042611_0042816 Actually, yeah, like another common thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042816_0043260 like if you have it so set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043260_0043622 I mean that's kind of a typical action. Double-click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043622_0044106 If you don't click on a particular topic or something that goes to sort of like a default view.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044106_0044434 so it will be like all the cases of that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044434_0044882 either whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044882_0045291 and just show up the particular instances of that topic in the meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045291_0045449 I just think to have the default there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045449_0045889 So if somebody knows exactly what they want to do, and we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045889_0046271 So the door flick will do that and just save from the trouble of right clicking and choosing the other one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0046605_0046933 Well, you might come to us and start playing with it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047144_0047355 Like we have the right click menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047355_0047814 Right click. But instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047814_0048253 It will be a trick on you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050686_0050787 Still coming.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050787_0050871 Hold on, they're closing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050901_0051245 Yeah, it's not that well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0056935_0057122 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0061525_0062063 Think we probably need that though to have the full flexibility we need to have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0062635_0063079 Well, the thing is typically though is someone can have five windows open at the same time, probably not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0063079_0063650 Probably not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0064658_0064727 It'd be good to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066363_0066473 Let's have a time there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066473_0066660 There's my stuff here too.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0067707_0067992 I don't think to have a nice one to be that British.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0070776_0071251 Yeah, or you can just have buttons on it, toggle buttons or something on the toolbar for that window.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071444_0071496 something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071604_0071899 There's a lot of different ways we can do it. It doesn't have to be a tab or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071899_0072058 No, no, it could be like...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072507_0072576 or checkmarks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072576_0072925 Mae'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r number o gweithio.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0073677_0073785 O que está fazendo?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0075628_0075840 Yeah, you can't do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076219_0076581 Like a lot of these can be like once we get the disclosures out then we can
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076581_0077006 transcript with the dysphoenzy, transcript with the dysphoenzy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077006_0077098 Sub-always, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077098_0077878 How about these sort of using the same window and so we can definitely go to be in the same one and probably mutually
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077878_0077947 Which was...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0080447_0080587 Do you want to do that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082308_0082395 in February.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082870_0083007 And it kind of
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0085854_0085988 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089197_0089641 Actually, is the code accessible like the GUI stuff that you've done there?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089641_0090010 like can we just copy the latest stuff out of your directory?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090010_0090601 Like if we're gonna just try like take a look or something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090732_0091278 But if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, then we know the directory to get in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091362_0091506 I don't know if it's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091705_0091985 I think by default there aren't. No, they're not world readable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0092565_0092653 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093261_0093398 Great to just email to us.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093398_0093531 Okay, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093531_0093627 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0096404_0096606 We're leaving.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101290_0101489 All the stretching.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101489_0101940 We'll be right back.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102357_0102731 So you can probably just use that code. Like that was behind the question just. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102731_0103149 just, you know, the reusing code and stuff, which is like, okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0103286_0103406 Yeah, well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104422_0104524 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104524_0104872 I'll probably still do some other phylamenic, well, I'm not quite sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104872_0105003 Let's take this around.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0111840_0111900 and scream.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0115078_0115204 Libraries.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0116848_0117033 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117033_0117172 So you're still here?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117172_0117196 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117363_0117533 Yes, exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117533_0118031 I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whatever it was last week. Oh, last week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118578_0118835 What? Well, you're an SPNLP and SP2, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118835_0118904 That's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118904_0118986 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0119724_0119772 Я хуя.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120585_0120701 Yeah, that's fun.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120932_0120956 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121271_0121856 Yeah, I was thinking the weekend probably. But I started attacking this seriously.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121856_0122358 Hopefully I have something by next week that we can sort of try to integrate into the good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0122504_0122604 It should be possible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127378_0127795 What they didn't say wasn't the most efficient.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127795_0128003 I doubt quite quickly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0142505_0142623 Okay, forget it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0144017_0144115 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145397_0145576 Yeah, that's interesting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145873_0145886 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146004_0146201 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146304_0146826 Still in the bottom of the mountain. How many hours is this?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0147120_0147459 to explore any other.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0148212_0148293 Bye.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149554_0149614 who was doing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149880_0150007 You do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150178_0150270 Well, I'll do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150288_0150408 This can be changed.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150408_0150546 정말 진짜
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150546_0150752 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150752_0150839 if you want to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150839_0151060 It's just, you know, play around with some extra stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0151060_0151220 Do you have some time?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153025_0153272 Is that informatics?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153272_0153425 Yeah, it's a...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153425_0153739 I would play digital.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0156246_0156562 I'll be happy when this week is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157002_0157469 I don't know, is that about it though? Anything else we need to discuss?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157652_0158052 Did we want to meet before we talk to Steve next week?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158298_0158434 Well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158434_0159102 We'll probably get some work done over the weekend, so I know after DNLG or something, maybe just have a little quick little update and just...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159414_0159510 when we kiss the side then
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159510_0159565 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160177_0160605 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160605_0160782 Couldn't be that hard.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160782_0161336 Wow, it'll be still a limited version of the next query.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161336_0161524 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161524_0161669 It won't be a whole thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161669_0161948 We can just decide sort of things that we do want to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162062_0162239 Actually, it wasn't just Dalen Max.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162239_0162386 That was awesome.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0163096_0163352 for some rain topics to read.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0164731_0165115 Yeah, it gets behind schedule pretty quick.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165115_0165239 Like you're saying.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165239_0165581 Well actually do we want to set a date for interim prototype?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165701_0165820 specifically, a date.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0174020_0174401 It's quite pessimistic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0175200_0175308 I
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177666_0177789 Nice, not easy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177789_0177962 So, we'll be back on the weekend.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0179495_0179561 to see what that is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181028_0181137 I just like the bass.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181137_0181361 No already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181742_0182107 just like all the unseeing the code and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182107_0182452 I just get a quick look over and just take a search tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182497_0182770 or like the other class paths, all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182770_0183332 You say, okay, well here's everything's basically set up and then just jump right in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183644_0183749 That's all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183976_0184292 근데 뭐...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184735_0184862 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184862_0185309 Well, I think it was a joke. Something like that couldn't happen anytime because, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185309_0185690 Like my schedule is like a class, break, class, break, class.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185690_0185974 Yeah, you know exactly that's what I'm thinking
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185974_0186364 So something like that, and then if I have a classic, I can run off. Pick your time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0186612_0186822 Monday might be good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187025_0187110 What is this?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187237_0187767 Anytime. Not at noon or two or four.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187767_0188059 No, in between those, yeah. Like one, three.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189157_0189286 Yeah, that's an option too.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189286_0189383 Dr. King.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189596_0189653 지금까지 뉴스에 대해 알아보겠습니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190197 or 330.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190197_0190345 I just, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190345_0190549 necessary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190727_0190876 Actually, we just had a skid in there, though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0191260_0191791 Can I have your game? We can get in through the computer rooms in here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192004_0192373 Well if you find me I'll show you where our letters all in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192373_0192682 there we can look out in there
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192682_0192781 See ya.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193087_0193279 Just for playing with it. Yeah, it's something else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193279_0193562 I was asking Steve about that, whether we can get in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193562_0193757 whether he was going to get us access into it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193869_0193922 the computer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194295_0194371 It would do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194872_0194961 Is there a printer in there too?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195394_0195537 That's good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195537_0195672 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195774_0196406 We can photocopy your assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0196431_0196575 Well, the comments, I'm thinking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197063_0197125 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197125_0197320 Felly, a'r ffordd yw'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197879_0198035 as long as DLG doesn't go late.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199514_0199666 А взлать мить?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199840_0199917 Hey.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199917_0199994 What?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199994_0200131 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200785_0200843 Let's practice.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200979_0201027 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0201901_0202026 Something like that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202026_0202188 I think one, a couple classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202392_0202622 It was bizarre, really. They didn't really know what was going on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202622_0202650 I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202962_0203257 He goes up to the professor whether they did it or not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203257_0203347 Well, I don't collect it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203347_0203466 Да
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203466_0203610 I think what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203610_0204092 I think the IEL will probably have one to make up for missing classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0204092_0204431 D.O.L. We'll probably. Yeah, we will probably.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0206079_0206202 Oh, wait, trust you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0207928_0208146 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208436_0208731 and really want multiple windows from a single app.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208960_0209241 but most will probably want to go with the false.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209692_0209717 from the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209873_0210490 Yeah, exactly. Just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210621_0210766 Let's go ahead.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210766_0210858 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0002480_0002851 I think it was the first time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004285_0004363 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004581_0004696 I was thinking about that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0006202_0006252 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008166_0008661 Very interesting stuff at the meeting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008661_0008947 Thank you guys for being down.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0023120_0024443 Perfection. Yes. That idea. Let's just cut out the middle mass. Yeah, exactly. I'm not even gonna tell if you're going wrong anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024443_0024853 Nemá bych to velice.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024853_0025092 You
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0025508_0025538 up to you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0026675_0027547 I'll look at it like my usual working hours are like from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0027547_0029410 I know you're always online! It always makes you feel bad because when I go to bed at like one you're still online! You never go to bed! Sleep? I just leave your computer on maybe. Yeah, you pretend. Always busy. Yeah, right. So maybe...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029410_0029595 but I'm never online on the money.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029595_0030227 You know just like no one is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0030764_0031418 Yn ymwneud, yn ymwneud, yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0031418_0031794 Was there anything else we wanted to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033101_0033591 Probably want to think about it if we want to change our goals and stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033591_0034574 I think one thing that we could probably skip totally is the removing things from the body of fire.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0034821_0035259 I'm gonna attempt that. No. I don't think so. I'm too big.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0037281_0037580 Yeah, but that's definitely one thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0041751_0041938 Mike, you know, it's a lot of pressure. I'm gooey.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0042617_0044950 Yeah, more or less. Yeah. It's very... It's very... It's plus or minus three days. It doesn't have to know exactly. Yeah, that's true. I mean, yeah, I haven't... It's not finished, but... So I've only got six days to do the topic segment. Yes. You don't have any SPNL PSL in the studio.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053678_0053740 of
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053740_0054016 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0056905_0057415 should we and I don't think my but our things that we have gathered
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057415_0057650 With those apart? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057650_0058070 I'm sorry, I'm very far.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058198_0058396 I'm gonna just put it in the video.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058396_0058593 Well, if we're skipping the audio one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058775_0059373 Just keep it together on the paper.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059565_0059750 А ты дискультишь?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059750_0059870 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0060478_0060694 Yeah, we could just speak about it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064215_0064651 Yeah, my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064651_0065348 I don't know, please send it in the afternoon. I can add a few sentences to what I'm done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065842_0065968 This is not funny.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065968_0066281 And also, sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066281_0066343 right down
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066765_0066801 But.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067581_0067962 Well, I still like struggling with job stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067962_0068274 Yeah, but welcome.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068274_0068805 I think I was wondering about that is how I look that in so much more
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068805_0069665 but if you guys know how you can do the like from the extract words that you did
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0069665_0070203 Like also it's extract time Samsung.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074139_0074374 So now I can just put it in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074504_0074606 from the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074844_0074902 on the

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0090755_0090862 and at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0115911_0115974 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0118646_0118718 and
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0121631_0121738 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0123724_0123835 Yeah, only, only,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0125288_0125530 Okay, the next mount.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0126896_0127147 We were not moving. Well...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127290_0127571 We're not gonna do much more than just look at the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127716_0128450 like the text will remove these differences because we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna like listen to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128644_0128816 is what I'm doing the audio thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128989_0129377 So I guess just displaying it is...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0129377_0129503 Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't read.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0130870_0130929 because that says
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131677_0131891 Yn ymwneud y gallwn yn ddweud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131891_0132149 I don't think it's gonna take long to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0153855_0154032 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0169683_0170405 Maybe a sleep.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0170405_0170552 and some of the other things that we've done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0171979_0172091 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172091_0172338 Ok, je vais aller voir.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172761_0173069 stick it together, she'll shine it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0173660_0174199 anchoring back any things that I thought was wrong.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174199_0174381 They were changing dialogue
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174381_0174703 I won't do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175396_0175540 You
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175540_0175983 It was like four lines.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175983_0176353 12.30 tomorrow with the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012414 I love Taiwan.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0013926_0014135 Who's he?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014135_0014222 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014265_0014294 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014437_0014850 I'm not sure if we need the outline of the prototype.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014850_0015021 I mean, what will we're going to put into that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015441_0015688 Yeah, because I mean that's been screen shots and all that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015688_0015753 the whole.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025379_0025658 Yeah well, I mean it's up to you if you want to keep going with that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025658_0025799 I'm happy to do so as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025799_0025919 I have lots of time tonight.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026045_0026664 Ac ydych chi'n gwybod i chi i chi.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026664_0026730 It's all over.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027533_0027852 I know you're always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027852_0028436 It always makes me feel bad because when I go to bed at like one you're still alive.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028436_0028592 He never got a chance.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028865_0029045 Yeah, he pretend.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029045_0029133 Oh, c'est bêtis !
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029133_0029280 It's the right one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029280_0029409 So maybe
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032386_0032508 Oh, it's mom.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032508_0032636 That's the original.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032636_0032810 Oh, this is the one that...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0034547_0034909 That's what I thought as well. Are we actually going to attempt that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035060_0035247 I think so.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035247_0035573 I think that's going to be, we don't even know how to approach that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036630_0036715 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036715_0036928 Yeah, yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036928_0037935 So maybe, I mean we should definitely, well we could probably not put it under this heading.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0037935_0038266 but put it under changes since the initial investigation.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0038266_0038901 a dwi'n dweud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0039384_0039848 We prefer to concentrate on the main.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0040496_0041100 And I think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041252_0041505 Or some of the words a bit later.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041758_0041920 I, yeah, it's not a price I've given
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041920_0042435 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042609_0042719 Yeah, yeah. More or less.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042719_0042856 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045213_0045428 And you can say, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045428_0046024 Mae'n ddweud ymlaen i'r ffordd y dyfodol i'r ffordd yma.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0047485_0047593 I'm out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048189_0048321 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048321_0048439 I really want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048439_0048678 It's not gonna be difficult.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048678_0049161 felly mae'r informatio'r cyfnod yn y metodatr fel.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049161_0049366 That's gonna be the work.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049366_0049523 So it's definitely going to be something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0050130_0050484 Yeah, we might turn out what you're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0052660_0052741 Yeah, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053015_0053059 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053774_0054353 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'n meddwl i'r cyfnod o'r gweithio'r cyfnod.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0054353_0054961 That's what he hinted that we should also indicate who is responsible for what.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0055764_0056002 way you could put, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0060677_0060763 Oh my god.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0061496_0061766 Felly, rydyn ni'n gweithio'r ddweud?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0062920_0062973 I'll be working.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0063613_0063708 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0076781_0077134 So, did you have you made another embryo?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0077134_0077273 Is there something that I should
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078221_0078524 Not since you don't talk.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078524_0078671 I thought you said, okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079643_0079886 I'll do it again.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079886_0080250 We're getting zapped.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0083744_0083850 Sorry for the while.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084213_0084627 At the moment is there a window that comes up?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084627_0084835 What was that? A second result of pain?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084835_0085080 was a, you know, zoomed again larger.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0085080_0085345 I thought we were sort of
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090405_0090683 tabs but then you can
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090855_0091354 But you don't want to compare the result, the one topic result with one summary result.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091653_0091831 We'll see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091831_0092168 Yn ymwneud, yw'r gweithio'r gweithio ar y gweithio'r gweithio.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092292_0092417 So let's have a unit talk.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092417_0092558 I can't trust this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093213_0093492 I mean, we could order them by meeting, for example.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093846_0093986 Reorder by
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093986_0094497 Yeah well I mean if you know that's even the second step the first question is do we want to order them?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0094497_0094659 How do we want to order the manifesto?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0095725_0095842 Yeah, maybe you should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098204_0098433 Yeah, why don't you just...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098544_0098638 color code those.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098797_0099022 the results to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101350_0101436 No, but if you...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101561_0101936 If you do it straight from, you know, you get the result.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101936_0102270 ac mae'r hyn yn ystafell yn ystafell.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0102270_0102935 ychydig o'r rôl i'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'r cyfnodd, o'

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103884_0103924 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104204_0104330 Well, trying to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104991_0105085 Oh.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105335_0105452 working with an event.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105878_0106013 Oh, oh, I see ya.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106358_0106545 figure something out like that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106955_0107583 Yeah, I mean at the moment it works. It works with highlighting in the transcript window, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0109010_0109145 What do you mean, you two worked together?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0110572_0111480 Felly, mae'r cwm yw'r cwm yw'r gweithio a'r gweithio'r gweithio'r cyfnod yma yn ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111480_0111676 Okay
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111951_0112094 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112214_0112478 I don't know what I know what it's called.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112478_0112878 And that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112878_0113350 Felly, mae'n gwybod, yna, yna, yw'r cyffredin o'r hynny, yw'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffredin o'r cyffred
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0113350_0113593 So maybe it comes with something clever as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114147_0114464 No, I'm sure it's not pained.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114635_0114909 Text them. Yeah, that's another one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114909_0115049 the mic now.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115049_0115317 Nogwch chi'n gwybod yn teimlo.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115317_0115547 Yeah, why? There's not many, mate.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115547_0115719 Yn ymwneud, yw'r model?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122144_0122353 Why do we want it in XML then?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122353_0122857 I mean, I thought we just selectively, selectively write the XML that we've got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123113_0123303 So as opposed to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123577_0123610 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123720_0124313 Yn ymwneud o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124313_0124485 Dyma'r ymlaen i'r prinsau all ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124485_0124910 Felly mae'r ddweud yn ddifwlwg.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124910_0125118 not not store it at all whatsoever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0125724_0125789 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129048_0129102 So I guess
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129404_0129617 Yeah, yeah, you don't really need to do much more with it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129617_0129694 That's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0131930_0132233 I don't think it's going to take long to produce anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0132233_0133122 Mae'n ddweud o'r ffordd. Mae'n ddweud o'r ffordd, mae'n ddweud o'r ffordd, mae'n ddweud o'r ffordd, mae'n ddweud o'r ffordd, mae'n ddweud o'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0134416_0135016 You can nearly do it together with the transcription, with the original transcription, having one parallel.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135186_0135590 So if it's a proper word,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135590_0136024 Rwy'n meddwl i'r meddwl i'r meddwl, ac yn ymweld i'r meddwl i'r meddwl i'r meddwl i'r meddwl.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136024_0136232 I mean that's fancy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136493_0136570 E aí, publica.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137075_0137136 See you then.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137251_0138184 you know, the good way of doing it, not together, is that if someone doesn't want to look at the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138184_0138407 you know the chop file and you don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138548_0138826 But I mean you can you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138826_0139583 you can write. We can write something like, we'll try and do it on the fly and observe if that's going to take too long.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0139583_0140140 i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'r llwyth i'w ddweud yw'

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0141684_0141738 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0151881_0152103 That's what programming is all about, I'm afraid.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153323_0153432 It's the higher people.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153895_0153967 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154087_0154810 Yeah, why don't you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both of something?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154810_0154970 if you want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154970_0155409 I personally don't want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0155409_0155526 I want to do it significantly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0158643_0158795 It has already loaded anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0160386_0160730 So should we all write a letter or two about future work as well?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0160914_0160996 I'm trying to receive
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161180_0161213 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161522_0161681 Yeah, well maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161799_0161936 Yeah, so that's...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0162278_0162642 Yeah, like this is what we've done already and then you know, you might lose a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164106_0164193 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164255_0164357 Yeah, maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164930_0165079 I'll continue with you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168333_0168547 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168547_0168840 Anything else? Anyone else at all?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168840_0169092 We all have sleep already.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0169365_0169426 But it's out.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073145_0073437 Okay, and I'll tell you this dog time to that time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073437_0073534 I think it would say it's a double.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074447_0074908 Yn ymwneud, mae'r ffordd yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074908_0075230 Mae'r ddweud yn ymddiad.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0075640_0075774 That's it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088240_0088442 What have you confused me?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088442_0088847 Do you have three separate windows for the three separate different types of windows?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089021_0089334 OK, nid yw'r rhaid i'r ffordd?

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118766_0119675 because I was wondering how we're going to write it back to HTML, I mean XML if we did the processing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0119829_0119979 writing it back to XMR.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121828_0122215 There is some bizarre method that puts things back into X and Y form.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0123311_0123783 Select what we want, just take bits of the XML, only take certain segments.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124458_0124617 We'll just put a new flu bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124617_0124713 Yn ymwneud yw'r unrhyw gwaith.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124713_0124801 Sensei.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124801_0124917 Like that. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125458_0125580 Say something
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125580_0125640 Thanks for watching.

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125942_0126120 This makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126120_0126533 Mae'r ddweud y gallwch chi'n ddweud ychwanegwch ar gyfer ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126533_0126623 So yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129316_0129464 This one is tough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129659_0129757 I think it's like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130301_0130473 would just be a blurb like a summary.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130473_0130975 it won't look like it won't say speaker X says this, speaker Y says that, speaker Z says this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131287_0131598 Yn ymwneud, yw'r fwrdd, ond mae'n fwrdd yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131598_0131725 Felly sydd gwaith ddaw'r cyffredin.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0132163_0132382 use anyway. It's just another
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133236_0133358 It doesn't want to fire you, I know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133510_0133859 So then it just goes through and says that this word equals that imprint.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0134183_0134337 Ys y bant y listau nes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136501_0136598 Yeah, you probably care that shit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136598_0136789 probably not that good
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136789_0136955 you just think fatten the code out a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136955_0137127 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0138300_0138507 you don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140016_0140051 should
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140051_0140536 They just behave statements, they're very fast statements.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140536_0140696 I was just thinking though, I was probably
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0141246_0141295 Não sei.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0143934_0144261 Alw, ond y fflaid ystod yn teimlo i'r cyfrifio.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144261_0144569 even trying to read it in XMO, which I've always complicated enough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144569_0145137 I gave up doing that, but I devoted back to night stuff because it was a lot too much and much easier.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145283_0145518 Felly, mae'n dweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i

AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146289_0147004 You have to start defining object models like the night thing and games. All because of weird things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0147004_0147093 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0157867_0157939 Especially really.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0158908_0159085 Yeah, it's after it's later.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159237_0159400 Mae'n ddweud y ffordd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159400_0159494 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0160891_0161131 Rwy'n credu bod y bydd yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn y
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0161282_0162274 I just said I said well that's so far and what I'm gonna do yeah well maybe and some some issues um I'll take into each
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162274_0162383 At least this
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162560_0162760 You might lose a bit of continuity if you do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162760_0162852 Eu sou você aqui.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162852_0163194 Sometimes it's easier to have the top in this own instructions. Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163194_0163417 I took about speaker chargers and sing me a song.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163985_0164101 skulls or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164101_0164355 Yn ymwneud, yw'r bollwch.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164381_0164747 Because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there... Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164747_0165061 They're not together, you lose a lot of the continuity.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0165202_0165243 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0168522_0168675 So, that's the end.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172742_0172828 You stick it together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172828_0172899 しようしようね
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0176443_0176700 That's just demo.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178273_0178394 12 days of writing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178394_0178659 That's what I love about you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003903_0003990 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003990_0004240 I like to pronounce this one because...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004240_0004381 I'll take notes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004495_0004612 Danke schön.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004745_0005954 I wish I could just first thing I just sort of did a really sort of brief, you know, version of what we have to do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0005954_0006231 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012470_0012730 Actually, without I was just copying one straight over the other, talking at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012730_0013102 So it's all whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0013772_0013822 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014111_0014174 Oh, sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014174_0014244 Sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015004_0015184 I'll just sort of... the things, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015184_0015707 We're going to be touching on all that during the other part for the process.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015707_0015897 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015897_0016426 Well, it's just something that he had mentioned in the previous, like just to sort of have a prototype to go.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016426_0016728 and that's what I'm saying that we could potentially do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016728_0016792 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016792_0016898 C'est parti.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017730_0017785 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017785_0018043 Like the thing is I was thinking even the stuff that I was doing on YouTube.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018043_0018395 just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018395_0018519 I can either, I can just ignore it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018519_0018560 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018560_0018829 Oh yes, yeah, well actually I had that at the very end, screenshots.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018829_0018936 Put that in chop on the spoon.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018936_0019111 I didn't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020934 Anyways, so yeah, this is just very general structure. I guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021133_0021163 All right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021313_0021454 That's it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021454_0021977 So I know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this, I could do that before I meet with you guys.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021977_0022293 Otherwise, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0022293_0022953 Um, if there's anyone else wanna throw it together, actually I can probably still throw it together if you want. Put your parts into this one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023125_0023329 Perfection
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023630_0023745 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023745_0024214 He's kind of the middle man. Yeah, exactly. He's probably gonna tell us he got it wrong anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0024214_0024440 You
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0027526_0027739 I know you're always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028668_0028943 I just figured, can you do it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028943_0029179 He pretends. Always busy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0029731_0030110 I noticed I'd known this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030110_0030238 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030488_0030619 So I'll send it out to you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030619_0030654 kind of.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031329_0031464 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031677_0031881 Was there anything else we wanted to add to this timeline?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031881_0032249 I mean, essentially was what? You can't see it or I thought.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032249_0032460 Oh, there's mom.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032460_0032772 Oh, that's original.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032772_0033027 Yeah, yeah, let's just copy it straight out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0036788_0037258 I'm just going to discover some sort of time warp thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0038142_0038232 that is the question.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041160_0041286 This smells.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041286_0041566 or some of them are a bit later.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041566_0041631 Ok, il va.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042654_0042791 more or less.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042881_0042968 That's very true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042968_0043351 Plus or minus three days. He doesn't have to know exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043351_0043505 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043505_0043786 I mean
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044331_0044624 Jesus.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044624_0045064 You don't have any SPNLPS on you, Steve.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046238_0046442 Not really. Yeah, tea days good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046442_0046502 아, 진짜.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046502_0047118 For one of those, something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0047576_0047898 Should we put it? I hint that something like that might happen into the document.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0048484_0048561 It's not.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049218_0049277 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049277_0049343 Thanks for.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049542_0049639 Mae chi ddyswpeth.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0051551_0051685 tune the culli at you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0054984_0055312 Mae'n cael ei wneud i'r llwyddiad o'r llwyddiad o'r llwyddiad.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055312_0055519 That's essentially the same as it was.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055519_0055766 More detail specifically.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057504_0057594 Split those apart.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057638_0057891 I think we should have gotten a great product.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057891_0058016 But whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0058470_0058757 if we're skipping the audio one, then things aren't easy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059159_0059383 Have you taken it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059383_0059545 Will you take any more of a look at it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059545_0059671 Have a good one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059852_0059926 You could probably.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060166_0060504 I know for a long time to look at that before tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060504_0060724 We could just make it up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060724_0061147 Like I'll claim one, you claim the other for the search things and then we can leave that one as a joint one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061295_0061394 Can we pick it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061780_0062365 I found finally today something that I can build it in and I should have something for tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0062365_0063158 I should at least have a gooey. I'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063158_0063436 I want to get something. I want to see this. I want to get it together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063436_0063952 I haven't imagined my mom being in a different scene. Yeah, yeah, yeah. On the thing and then, get my screenshot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065078_0065557 It's just too much. It doesn't really matter. I mean, if you write this, it says first as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065557_0065912 I mean, with the attention that this is not.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065912_0066273 I mean, also, sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066273_0066537 I write down the words and the ideas.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066537_0066801 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0067941_0067973 time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077159_0077621 There is but I've been made a lot of changes to it
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077621_0077969 so I might just delete what I've done in copied infameras.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077969_0078306 Because I'm sure you've probably made some changes already. Not since you don't.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078306_0078362 of
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078362_0078473 Subscribe to the channel.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078539_0078676 I thought you said... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078676_0078817 Alright, I see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078856_0079508 I thought you said you would written something that maybe I've caused some bugs and let you work in pixels on the weekend or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079508_0079598 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0079847 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079969_0080142 Okay, cool.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080142_0080966 All of their stuff out there that... Actually, I'm going to try and minimize the amount of changes I make to Ambrowser anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080966_0081036 Chilling time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081165_0081248 真便宜
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081248_0081582 Actually, just to clarify, last week when we were talking about our search results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081582_0082029 Like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082114_0082502 Do we want separate result panes for each of those?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082502_0083092 or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083092_0083471 so that when they click on that it's going to go to the relevant thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083471_0083998 Like just if they check all three say topics, have three different windows come up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0084148_0084359 or three like so.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085039_0085733 I think what we sort of discussed last week was to have it sort of on the same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085733_0086046 So it'll be on the search window, bottom half of the search window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086046_0086485 I know we still want to keep it that way, but that's that's what it's gonna be working with
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086485_0086802 So it's just like you click those and it's just what's up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086802_0087255 Yeah, split-stop thing into two or three or whatever it is. One, two, three, depending on which one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087255_0087384 fun to check.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087384_0087866 So if we want to do it that way, you know, like it probably doesn't matter too much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087866_0088246 Just try and think of there's going to be any other issues down the road.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0088813_0089409 Nod, rhai, rhai, rhai, rhai, rhai.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089409_0089503 C'est bon.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089503_0089859 So it's just when we click topics in some ways for what we want to search.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089859_0090212 There will be two result pains.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090212_0090467 I don't know, really tabs.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090467_0090932 But then you can't see all of them at the same time
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0091303_0091783 Well, it's no, but the things if you're looking, if you check them both, you'll see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092178_0092282 That exactly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092314_0093320 So there's several end topics in the transcript. Or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0093620_0094088 Oh yeah, I guess that's the other thing whether we want to have this reorder by... Yeah, well, I mean, they...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094088_0094233 That's what that's about.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094233_0094296 second
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094729_0094978 I think, yeah, probably by meeting makes no sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094978_0095288 I mean, essentially they're 10 in time order.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095288_0095598 So that kind of makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095767_0095835 changed.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096204_0096458 这比你紧
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096458_0096585 should be filled in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0098888_0099364 I think sometimes in a case like that, like I run across some in other languages.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099364_0099946 It's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it's put into a list box or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099946_0100175 It's hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100175_0100452 and then we're highlighting something in the transcript window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100452_0101260 it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in all this box and I don't know this box.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101260_0101496 No, but if you...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101496_0101599 Whereas if it's coming from...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103036_0103108 As a
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103329_0103842 Um, yeah, it's just like from past experience, there's goofy little things that happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103842_0104599 just to let you save certain things and just kind of trying to do a different kind of to go to a different window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0104599_0105080 So if you want to come to the actual highlight the transcript, not highlight the topic.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105080_0105308 At that point, that's where it starts getting a little bit tricky.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105308_0105835 because you're working with an event handler within the one panel or a loosebox or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105835_0105890 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106024_0106677 There aren't ways around it, but whether we'll be able to figure something out before tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106677_0106952 My gum gets rid of it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106952_0107083 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107588_0107656 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107851_0108601 I think he was saying that as long as we implement that interface, it should work with anything that we do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108601_0108763 Like highlighting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108763_0109120 I think that was a song. Who sang it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109120_0109343 It wasn't Jonathan saying something like that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109343_0109760 I think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109760_0110058 you should be able to have that highlighting happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110058_0110116 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110116_0110158 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0113476_0113968 Okay, that should use that as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115367_0115504 What? There's no many women.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115704_0115871 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0119968_0120335 I think we were just going to have to do this words
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0120335_0121016 Like not as XML, just sort of as a... What was I done? Text file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121016_0121339 No, because then we need all the other data from the transcript.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121635_0121783 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121783_0121815 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125252_0125286 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125286_0125531 Okay, the next one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125531_0125664 نعم
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125664_0125902 That's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125902_0126033 Actually, but this makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0126624_0126989 Yeah, if we're gonna do the X-Millen, fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129344_0129433 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129704_0130120 But I think it's like, well, how would we display the like if we do take this fluency zone just, you know,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130120_0130471 credit tax file I think they just went to tax file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130967_0131486 Unless we extract that over the file when we create the text file. Yeah, it will look ugly probably because it will look just...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0131568_0131631 That's realistic.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140401_0140531 work.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140531_0141101 I was just thinking that it's probably been used like XSLT to kind of just transform it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141101_0141775 flip it into just a transform zone like um style sheet
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141775_0142195 And then it's kind of like there's usually things built in too. Well, it should be built into John.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142195_0142837 process like in just creates whatever file it's going to be
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142837_0143107 It's been a couple years since I looked at anyone like this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143107_0143373 咱們音笔你就玩
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143373_0143725 And then that way we could even pre-process that beforehand.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143725_0143963 I don't know. We don't want to have to do that, right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143963_0144215 Oddwn, ond y fflau is y bydd.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144532_0144657 I gave up doing that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144657_0144731 Maybe we'll...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0145444_0145524 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146551_0146596 No way.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146596_0146733 and gangsters.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146895_0146946 See you soon.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147168_0147522 I was thinking I might try and talk to... Who is it? Jonathan? Gene?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147522_0147857 Just to see what system they used to develop this stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147857_0148685 because it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just actually use the system.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148685_0148921 You're at a higher level rather than kind of, you know,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148921_0149202 playing around with a little bit of code and modifying your code and things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149202_0149408 I mean, I should just sort of see what they're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149408_0149827 So I might try and contact them, see if there's...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149964_0150225 Hence the gigabits.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150225_0150542 Just to get things moving at a higher level, I guess.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150688_0151137 Seems to be more interesting to use it as a real developer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151304_0151743 It just seems like a little tinkering here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151889_0151929 that's what
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152034_0152305 No, no, it shouldn't be.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152305_0152397 It should be higher level.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152397_0153316 It should be conceptual and brilliant ideas and then just bringing those to reality.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0153441_0153811 You
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0155864_0156372 Like the thing that was single there as well is that once it's done for one meeting, it's done. Yes, there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156372_0156430 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156430_0156582 text file or XML or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156582_0157089 Yeah, just, I don't know, it just doesn't make any difference really either way to me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157089_0157402 It's like, hmm, if it's fast enough, wanna fly an intro.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157402_0157749 That's what the only issue I have with on the fly, whether it's fast or not.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157956_0158182 Especially with Java and all that stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0158182_0158649 If it's loading the file, then it's processing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0159496_0159838 With a lens out of memory. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161181_0161213 All right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161805_0161922 Yeah, that's a good one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0162054_0162383 I can do it. At least this
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163146_0163210 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163372_0163537 I think that does make sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163537_0164018 But maybe at the end, maybe just a point form of things that we're still working on things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164018_0164192 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164712_0164801 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0165141_0165226 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168112_0168210 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168501_0168596 저희도
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171165_0171447 Or she'll just take it. She can take it for me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171447_0171516 то же самое
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171516_0171724 How kind.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171724_0172114 I can guess if you want to say it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172114_0172473 Yeah, okay, actually that's a good idea. I'll take one quick look over.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172473_0172728 try and get it as good as I think, don't we?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0173283_0173628 You're a good family.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0174290_0174848 They were changing dialogue back. I won't do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0175479_0175581 Hmm.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176364_0176543 Oh, oh my gosh.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176882_0177179 That's a smart one.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0010714_0010759 Bye.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012507_0012860 I think there is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012860_0014128 And just because the topic, box and all this is based on what was it called, non-night text area or something?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014128_0014333 Intext is always
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014333_0014626 It has some sort of highlighting stuff there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014626_0014856 So you should probably look at the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0015536_0015731 I'm not sure if it's in there, though, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0016668_0016786 Well, well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018250_0018339 You don't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018339_0018522 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018522_0018869 Yeah, I was thinking about it. Then tell me how you got the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0019053_0019099 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0021698_0021836 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0022987_0023159 Okay, yeah, see what I mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023159_0023237 everything, but that's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023237_0023267 That's what I want to know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023520_0024002 Felly, rydyn ni wedi cael ei wneud o'r ddeithas, yn ymwneud?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0024002_0024042 All right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0026456_0026737 I'm watching it come back.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0031624_0031695 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0033862_0034307 What the easiest thing to do is how do you want to just play? I mean I could do it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034307_0034400 Yeah, just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034863_0035710 So what, whenever we open a window for one speaker,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036852_0036935 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036935_0037078 Rwy'n meddwl.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0038146_0038190 Oh, is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042122_0042347 than the one present.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042347_0042747 Although we could do one highlight to dustfish.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0044963_0045399 Felly, mae'n ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045399_0045889 ..y'r cwm yw'r cyffredig, yw'r cwm yw'r cwm yw'r cyffredig?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045889_0046420 Felly, rydyn ni'n gwybod i'r tyfnodd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0046420_0047031 and it would come up with how much they spoke and you could pick the one that looks more... Yeah, yeah, that would be easier, sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047031_0047163 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047936_0048004 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0048166_0048640 Felly, mae'n rhan o'n ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0049178_0049243 So
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055128_0055476 Can you put in there what topic we're speaking about as well? Yeah, it'll be.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055476_0055829 Mae'r bwysig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056075_0056113 But that would
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056541_0056607 That wasn't wrong.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0057730_0058078 because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0058078_0058747 So you have the option of popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060366_0060622 So how would you calculate that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060622_0061042 Would you do the summarisation as you populate it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061042_0061259 what the global statistics comes from after that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061553_0062005 Alright, so that is all stored together. The speaker class knows about all of that stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062005_0062172 All right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062567_0062708 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062708_0063054 Ça ne m'a pas donné de l'air.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063054_0063276 Just got to decide on what we want to...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063527_0063800 I thought the other stuff was more important than anyone, so I did that first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063948_0064594 Felly mae'n gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r g
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0066667_0066722 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067308_0067648 Wel, rydw i'n fwy o'n fwy o'r fysydd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067648_0067710 If you can.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068138_0068232 What do you mean a picture?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068232_0068607 Just in just that. Yeah, but it's not gonna take forever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068607_0068783 I mean, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070272_0070386 So good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070386_0070452 So where's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070452_0070695 Yn ymwneud yw'r...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070898_0071135 On your home directory? Not in there?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0071468_0071520 Actually, I
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0072563_0073206 What are you wanting to write that in directly or what do you want to do? What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073206_0073320 if you want to change my code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073552_0074028 Yeah, but do you want to change that the original and brother fallen?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074028_0074121 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074288_0074356 Have you done that now?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074568_0074831 Oh, okay, so not the actual one, but a copy of it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075146_0075269 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075269_0075311 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075690_0075818 Well just, just how's it went?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075818_0076625 because I usually work on my own copy for the day and then update it without checking if the one in the show has changed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0076625_0076783 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0077208_0077283 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0078579_0078992 Llywodraeth yw'r ystafell yw'r ystafell yw'r ystafell yw'r ystafell?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0079726_0079893 I mean the highlighting stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0081352_0082292 Actually for an text area or whatever it is, they defined some handy highlights on that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082292_0082443 So you've got different highlights.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082443_0082847 Ie, dwi'n gofyn i'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082847_0083407 They've got user highlights, selection highlights, time highlights, and...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083564_0083648 Something else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083866_0084550 So you can quite easily, if your text area is called area, you just do area dot set highlights or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084550_0084615 是
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084903_0085417 That's the way I did it to cross-highlighting topics and transcripts.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0085647_0085685 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091133_0091466 But if you don't know me, I'm like... That's insane. Yeah, he says like...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091466_0092196 OK, oh yeah, I've got all this space, you can do this now. And as it goes, oh no!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092196_0092783 Yn ymwneud?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092912_0093190 I've spent too much time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093287_0093764 Alright, well I've been doing some random pop-up windows for the speaker characterization which is good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093764_0093949 So feel that in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093949_0094239 The windows are all there now, after lots of food.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094447_0094830 Wel, yna, ychydig y pop-up. Ychydig y pop-up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094830_0095852 because it basically has to set up like 10 pop-up windows in memory as in already initialized them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0095852_0097625 because there might be 10 speakers. Now all I have to have different windows. And I'm working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the topics of the meetings that topic was mentioned in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0097625_0098398 And I have a question about the said we wanted to start screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098398_0098686 what kind of stance we're in when we want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098686_0099910 I mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser? It's an SD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0099910_0100194 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0101016_0101819 So do we want, yeah, maybe we could write and I'll like that, whatever it's called, the top of the window saying, welcome to meeting Brazil.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0102824_0103036 Yeah, I'm proud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103036_0103596 Mae'r ffordd yw'r ffordd yw'r ysgol, mae'r menu yn ymddi.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103596_0104380 with all the... and that because it's the dialogue class that you use there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105197_0105814 I mean, I think they should have two options, either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105814_0106146 Yn ymwneud, mae'n gweithio'r gweithio, yn ymwneud yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106641_0106681 Does it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106846_0106986 The only thing he can search is a...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0109093_0109356 Can you not get this non object?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0110808_0111239 I spent, we wouldn't want to use, yeah we wouldn't want to use NXT beginning anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111239_0111597 because we don't want to search locally.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111597_0111799 So, I'm listening.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112036_0112390 one of them they would open the meeting bus right yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112390_0113079 So let's say you have two options, either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0114980_0115106 But why do we want default?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0115106_0115222 Just...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117710_0117866 Yeah, but local search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117866_0118149 We can do love also.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118149_0118201 It's pretty cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118903_0119072 So for getting any useful
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0119572_0120392 Ond y gallwn y Ffald-Sech yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiad
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0120772_0120979 Well yeah, that's always going to be the case with such.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0127554_0128257 I mean you can, you know, the option is to do a search in a way that, if you do a global search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128257_0128525 Ie, mae'r ffordd yw'r ffordd yn ymdweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128525_0129236 as in not even meetings but the name of the meetings. So you know say you want to search for the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129236_0129671 then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129671_0130137 and then you can decide, well I want to search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0131846_0131917 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0133484_0134502 There is, yeah, in one of the papers they have names. Oh, today, today?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0134502_0135159 It's part of it. Okay. That's what I probably just used up. Even better understanding. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135159_0135296 That's a working group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135328_0135540 I love that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136130_0136376 So I've put that in already too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136513_0136562 Let's go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136797_0137361 So yeah, again, concretely to the startup libraries we know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0138687_0138799 Well, it's...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139654_0139748 Yeah, how is that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139748_0140090 I mean, do you think you would have time for that as well?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0143830_0144030 It would have been like a list of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0146883_0147426 So the general score would that be for the whole of the language?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0147621_0147931 I'm not eating it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148152_0148272 and you know, like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148571_0149086 Felly, ydych chi'n gwybod y teimlo'r tawpig?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149086_0149296 Bunch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149296_0149507 Just almost like he wears us on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0150892_0151721 Because that would be really handy then, we can actually test it on the user, as opposed to just doing it and not using it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151721_0151946 because if you just have the segmentation, that's great.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151946_0152612 ond we can't compare it to the hand annotated, the hand segmented.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154848_0154929 You know what?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154929_0155000 It's going to be very nice.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0157347_0157497 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158504_0158755 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Do we need to?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158755_0158866 just looked into it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158866_0158946 for your snow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159488_0159909 sort of but then the main idea was Mike to speed up speed the search up
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159909_0160355 ..y'r anxd i'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r corpus.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160355_0160440 That way it's no doubt.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160737_0161085 know that the general inverted vowel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161085_0161177 It's still used as a...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161177_0161402 Felly mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161402_0161533 That would just be nice extra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161826_0162209 Yeah, I was a show. Don't think we have that in the dog name.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162322_0162464 You
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162464_0162631 So what? Is there any interview?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163367_0163566 Yeah, I mean, if you have time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163566_0163798 because I'm only going to do this at the right time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163798_0164155 Cys, rydyn ni'n ddweud yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164155_0164659 it will give you the meetings but also how often that word occurred in that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164659_0164887 Mae'r ddweud yn ddweud yn ymdill.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164944_0164998 You
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0165287_0165337 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166254_0166691 Mae'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166691_0167133 Yeah, if you search for language and you return like, you know...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0167133_0167654 basically all of the meetings. You want to see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169068_0169150 language and...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169607_0169964 Sunny days.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171103_0171347 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171347_0171413 Because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171413_0171547 The things that you can't do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0184287_0185068 So come back with the top screen. Oh, okay. I'm very unsure about what that should look like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185068_0185739 I mean, we run it for the part where you can choose the meeting. What kind of information do you want to have about meeting?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185739_0186339 I mean the longer name obviously if there is one because they don't all have longer names.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186339_0186624 What the user's that speak?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186624_0186781 Use that for panel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186781_0187146 then that's pretty much the same for the same group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187463_0187523 a set
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187875_0188443 Yeah, just to give them an idea, a general idea of what there is, so they can pick a suit.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190217_0190360 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190360_0191168 Rwy'n gwybod i'r gweithio y ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191168_0191313 ond y ddweud y ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191313_0191358 Bye bye.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193761_0193944 I'm not gonna make it to that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193944_0194339 because we just want to have a way of, you know,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0194339_0195069 Because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting, they can browse through that quite nicely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0196708_0196761 Au-delà de la France.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197378_0197509 or how and how are we going to do that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197755_0197983 They can have it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198418_0198689 But that would defy the whole point of browsing, right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198689_0198979 If you only need one to look at it. Well, alright, call it favourites then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198979_0199684 You can have a favorite.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0199684_0200295 Yeah, it's not enough in relation. It's not like they come back every day and do the same browsing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0200295_0200898 Ich bin zu viel zu schmackig.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0201511_0201565 고맙습니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0203619_0203867 So we can't, yeah. Alright. Sorry about that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0204433_0204785 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205023_0205757 I wasn't going to put any help in there, any sort of explanation of how the Razz works to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205757_0205864 To jest program cywistyczny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207091_0207139 watching.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207616_0207937 I don't mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208152_0208271 Yeah, we'll search, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208271_0208431 Even if it's just two things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0209821_0210117 Yeah, that all happens through the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210117_0210615 Basically either the user knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just clicks on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210615_0211023 or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213265_0213415 I watched it with me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213415_0213551 Inside the searchment.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0215327_0215467 Yeah, that's what...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216096_0216266 No, that one's not right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216266_0216811 ..y'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216811_0217577 the drop down menu but we want all the information about the name the longer you want to use
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217577_0217646 Well, we don't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217863_0218569 Yeah, it's too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0219105_0219240 drop down
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220084_0220230 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220271_0220456 That's the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0221530_0222119 No, no, no, I'm not saying you can pick a user, but it should come up with some list.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222119_0222777 but an extended list of the meetings. So you know, BDR whatever it was called, 0-1.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222777_0223344 and then it gives you the longer name, blah, and then it gives you the participants.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223637_0223889 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223959_0224134 I'm sick.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224134_0224316 But then is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224316_0224556 No, it's not at all, I think. I told her.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224556_0224692 I told them, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224692_0224950 Mae'n meddwl i'r ddweud yma, ond mae'n gweithio.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224950_0225317 Felly, dwi'n ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225317_0225963 Yeah, I'm not sure. Is that very... Is that not annoying? If you have to? Get out of the bed anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225963_0226273 I'm so happy. Yes!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226273_0226386 I could do that a lot, don't I?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226386_0226994 Mae'n ddweud ychydig o'r ddweud yma, mae'n ddweud yma.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226994_0227437 way. Yeah, that's the way. That's why you can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0229882_0230290 Just be nice to have some basic information on yeah, or you can have a text box there

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230807_0230954 Не, мы виноваты без наденок
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230954_0231487 So you've got a drop down menu, a search button, not search, go button.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0231713_0231788 and then
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232000_0232366 some sort of feels which updates stand out depending on what you've got highlighted.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232710_0232798 Yeah, that sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0233635_0233667 See?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234346_0234496 What is normal, I just had thought.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234696_0234930 Oh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235811_0235971 Rhaid i chi'n ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235971_0236358 You've got lots of non-something and then night-something and then end-something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0236758_0236869 ones in each face and ones out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238062_0238529 And most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you've got to update this Jonathan
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238529_0238836 This is unintelligible.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238898_0239158 Right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0240763_0241021 No, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241021_0241212 It's not very fun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241212_0241619 Great. So anyone else got anything to say?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0242119_0242579 Do we want another meeting at the end of the week?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243033_0243115 Yeah, it's not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243115_0243612 I mean, I think I'm going to do quite a bit of work this week, so I'll probably have more to talk about.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243817_0243898 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244842_0244907 if you like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244907_0245123 We can just discuss that Friday if you have any.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0245675_0245756 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0247755_0248019 I've got adopted at the point in time to two.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0250419_0250544 So we see

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0255359_0256031 because she's not here. No, I mean that she's collecting. Oh right, okay, sorry. Yeah, it's cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256031_0256612 I feel like meeting some of these in the room. I thought somebody was collecting them. Well, that's what I thought when you...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256612_0256834 We should probably do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257021_0257501 So can we just repeat briefly what I was talking about?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257501_0258117 So we've done progress on the speaker characterization. Who does speak characterisation?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258117_0258709 We mentioned topic labeling with keywords.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258709_0259136 Mae'n ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddys

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0265828_0266434 No, but for things like if you search for language, then you might have you have some topics which have as a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0266434_0267224 you know, some meetings which have as a topic language, they specifically speak about language and they use that word like in every sentence.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267224_0267660 ac mae'r ddweud ydych chi'n ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267660_0268069 My language is German or something stupid, but you don't really want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268069_0268282 So you want to distinguish that somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268282_0268379 Oh, I'm not a city like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268695_0268792 It's gonna be so good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269326_0269623 What's all terms we can just do something really simple?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269623_0269691 coming.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272028_0272402 Yeah, I just did. Thanks, I just took a...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272402_0272761 Yeah, I mean, you just do it really simply, you know?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272761_0273228 We'll have to talk to her and know about this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0273228_0273333 We are using that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274023_0274217 It doesn't have to be all intelligent.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274503_0274584 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281142_0281256 Please go ahead and eat.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281256_0281671 Yn 75 oes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283154_0283256 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283612_0284081 It would be useful if I thought of word-like language that might occur in all of them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284081_0284542 but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284934_0285207 you know, you still want to be able to search for the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285410_0285498 answer.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285850_0286022 We will discuss it here on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0002306_0002541 Yn ymwneud ymwneud?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0005698_0005937 Skyne, I was gonna give him a bath.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0009179_0009353 So I just said the same thing as you just said to us.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0010398_0010516 So have a good one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017338_0017486 I want to talk about that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017486_0018262 Yn ymddiadau'r prosesau yn ffynol, ond nid yn fwyaf i'r gwybod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018262_0018397 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018397_0019186 Felly, ydych chi'n gwybod ychydig i'r ddweud yma?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019186_0019778 is in my mind the the there is I've created two classes one recess speakers
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019778_0020295 ond yw'r ysgol yw'r gweithio, ac y ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud yn y ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020295_0020877 ac mae'n ddweud o'r objex ac mae'n ddweud o'r objex o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020877_0021528 ymlaen i'r ddweud o'r ddweud, ac mae'n ddweud i'r ddweud, ac mae'r ddweud yn ddweud o'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021528_0021812 So there's two separate classes, do you want to make?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021812_0021965 and they're two different objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021965_0022709 and you can really, they can write the objects and then you call the objects back and those returned objects have all the information that they need.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0022709_0023131 ac nid o'n meddwl i'r methu i gael yma'r ystod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023131_0023532 o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023891_0024199 Yn ymwneud, mae'r ddweud yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024199_0024593 ac yn allwch i'r objeu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024593_0025389 ac mae'n ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud ymlaen, ac mae'n ddweud y ddweud, ac mae'n ddweud y llyfr yn ddweud y llyfr yn ddweud y ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025463_0025733 and then all just going one at a time to pop that window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025733_0026149 Ond yna'r ffordd o'r holl ymlaen o'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i'r ddau i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026149_0026783 because it can come back as much as anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026783_0026961 Смел, да, мил.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0028239_0028328 Yeah, can you?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0029102_0030576 Felly, rydyn ni'n gwybod i'r ddweud yw'r cyfnod, mae'r ddweud ystod o'r cyfnodau a'r cyfnodau ar y ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r cyfnodau, oherwydd mae'n ddweud yw'r

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030860_0030913 to some extent.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030913_0031695 ac nid yw'r gwaith, yw'r link, yw'r cyfnod ymlaen, ac nid yw'r perffentag ar hyn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0031695_0032375 Felly mae'n gwybod i'n meddwl i'r hyn o'r hyn o'r hashtag oedd yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032375_0032689 Mae'r rhan o'r rhan o'r llwyffydd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032689_0032977 We will say a vector that's cool, I don't know, whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032977_0033810 Felly, mae'n meddwl ychydig o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cy
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0033810_0034240 What the easiest thing to this out how do you want to do it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0034640_0034795 Yeah, he's all the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0035962_0036317 See that's the key. How do we channel it like that again?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0036622_0037082 Mae'n ddweud o'r fformat.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037082_0037710 ysgol, ysgol yw'r cyntio?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037768_0038191 Felly, mae'r ddysgol yn ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r ddysgol i'r
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038191_0038361 Yeah, that's easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038361_0038476 So I'm going to go out and music it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038476_0038941 the influences on living in Germany for six months don't know if that had any effect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038941_0039137 Ysbyty mae'r tîm yn ddweud yn y brith.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039137_0039381 No, sono pesato.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039381_0039876 I don't think we're gonna need to give a cover up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039876_0040167 and then all that's calculated as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040167_0040336 yn ymddiolol i'r diolwg.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040336_0040428 That's not that significant.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041434_0041734 So then, how is this box populated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041734_0041973 Does it populate by the one present or the one highlighted?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042237_0042339 the one present.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042950_0043546 Cysyllt yn y moment, mae'n gweithio, mae'n meddwl yw'r ffordd yma, fel y ffordd yma, fel y rhaid i'r ffordd yma.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0043546_0044062 as president and say like get talk time and you take the name.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044062_0044474 Felly, mae'n gweithio'r methu sydd wedi'i gweithio'r methu sydd wedi'i gweithio.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044474_0044823 ac mae'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044823_0045043 Can you say for that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046352_0046390 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046899_0047044 Yeah, yeah, that would be easy as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047199_0047239 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047239_0047777 So I'll just leave in lots of methods that just return one number at a time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047777_0048030 Mae'n ddweud bod yn ymddi'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048030_0048200 Okay, yeah, that's for sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048700_0048948 Get to all time, I think it's for you.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050671_0050993 ac mae'n ddiddordeb o'r objeu yn ymddiad, yn ymddiad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050993_0051116 mae'n ddweud ychydig i'r ddweud yma.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051305_0051769 Felly, y gallwn ni'n gwybod y cyfnod ar gyfer y cyfnod arall, ond, ychydig yn gwybod y cyfnod arall.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052355_0052804 Dyna'r ddyn nhw'n cael ei wneud, a'r ddyn nhw'n cael ei wneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud, ac yn ôl yn fwy o'r ddyn nhw'n cael ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052804_0052879 Questo è il listo.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055903_0056071 Да, это вы не чеешь мне.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056071_0056435 Felly, mae'n gwybod y gallwn gweld ychydig yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn ymweld yn
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056752_0056795 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056795_0057141 Rwy'n hoffi'r taws bryd ystafell sydd fideb i'r adnod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057141_0057373 There are some deep of heart, nothing's actually...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057373_0057710 Love you, thank you, thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0058924_0059029 Yeah, yeah, that would be a problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059029_0059346 ac nid yw'n cael ei wneud o'r cyfnoddau, o'r cyfnoddau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059346_0059579 because that's the thing, these are so small.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059579_0060210 ..y'r cyflwyno'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r dd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0060210_0060321 So it doesn't crush the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061027_0061353 Mae'r gweld sy'n cymhysgol yn ystod o'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061353_0061562 because they just for the meat
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061822_0062225 The speaker class knows about all of that stuff. And the meeting class knows about that stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0062858_0063016 Да, да, вот они и вытяжку.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063289_0063528 ..y'r ffordd y gallwn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063528_0063805 I thought the other stuff was more important than anyone, so I did that first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064279_0064838 No, design the gear first because the problem is if you change the classes
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064838_0065272 the object's serial number is changing, you can't reload the object, so all the process has to be done over again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065272_0065398 ac nid o'n gwneud yn ystod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065605_0065949 Felly mae'r ffordd yn ymddiol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065949_0066289 ddim yn ymwneud. Ddim yn ymwneud i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i chi i
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066289_0066787 and then I changed it and run the thing again, you wouldn't have been able to let the adjustment go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066787_0067293 ac mae'n ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn ddweud bod yn dd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0067637_0068265 Ond ydych chi'n gwybod i'r ffyrdd, gallwn i'n gwybod i'r ffyrdd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068265_0068459 just that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068459_0068569 Yeah, but it's not going to take.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068569_0068860 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069110_0069420 Mae wedi bod yn teimlo i'r ddweud yn ffynis.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069420_0069766 Ond rwy'n cael ei wneud i'w ddangos ystafell.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069766_0069924 because otherwise the object wouldn't be the same.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0070656_0070793 I still might have the rich.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071077_0071212 Mae hwn i'n cael ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071212_0071434 Ove sve li je što pudite glavno?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089041_0089444 That way it doesn't crash, you try and let it go, tell me why it crashes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089444_0090063 It's a bit dumb if you can fool it, if you load up 10 different engines simultaneously.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090063_0090305 You can do that. Fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090305_0090583 But it can't do them if it thinks they won.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090583_0091142 Cysylltu'n ddweud yma yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw yw'r unrhyw
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091142_0091801 But if you don't know it, that's the same. Yeah, it says, OK, oh yeah, I've got a whisper to say for myself.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091801_0091884 안녕
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091884_0092582 Is it talking now?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0092582_0093326 said nice machine again. Spent too much time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094276_0094351 no, de edad, no
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094351_0094424 Yeah, I think so.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094645_0094693 They pop up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094693_0094753 It's difficult.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099083_0099438 It's a more modern SD browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099438_0100082 some speech and some music. It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0101925_0102381 or a switchboard that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102381_0102717 Let me a meeting, let me a search, let me something else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102717_0102797 We're so achieve.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0105945_0106173 stupid NFT search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106173_0106536 Felly mae'n gweithio i'r llwydoedd yn ymlaen i'r ffordd yma yw'r ysgolwch yn ymlaen i'r llwydoedd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106774_0107296 The only thing you can search is a night object model.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0107942_0108922 Felly, mae'n ddweud, mae'n ddweud, mae'n ddweud y ffarserthau ymddangos i'r ystafell yma, a'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0108922_0109064 Подлюбуем.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109368_0109743 It has to be an observation and even if you go and search the whole corpus from there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109743_0110080 but you have to have, it has to start with something for some bizarre reason.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110080_0110675 engine there's only one there's only one search method to the search engine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110675_0110886 the engine class only has one section
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0111483_0111596 Ychydig yn cael ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118131_0118293 Dyna'r ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn ddod yn

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0120372_0120433 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121092_0121255 But he gives one at a time anyway, doesn't he?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121255_0121388 because otherwise you'd crush the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0124992_0125139 It's not too slow though.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125139_0125328 It's not too bad, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125328_0125523 But I think now we have changed our system.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125936 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130214_0130271 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130271_0130817 Mae'n meddwl i'r lluniau yn ystod o'r lluniau, ac mae'n meddwl i'r lluniau, ond mae'n meddwl i'r lluniau.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130817_0130921 on these slides.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132245_0132471 Did we think about...

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134666_0134793 Okay, that's a little...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134793_0134875 We'll just use that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135077_0135305 That's a working group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135332_0135852 I want to see the media because they're about to be better than me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0136433_0136556 Okay, that's cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138033_0138314 So who would have the ideas?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138314_0138521 Felly, mae'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0140243_0140790 If somebody's done the key, so the idea of so the Dfs are really with me not too well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143073_0143304 How do you do an inverted file search without the TFID?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143503_0144032 I think you need to. It would have been like a worst.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0146188_0146938 Felly, mae'r fawr yn cael ei gael yn ymdweud y cyfnodau yn ymdweud yma, yn ymdweud yma, mae'r fawr yn ffordd yn ymdweud yma.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147303_0147608 The fuck you call cross the call and steal data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147937_0148548 Plus a stop list so you remove stuff like that which is going to have a basically equal score.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148964_0149212 Bwysg chi'n gweld.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149212_0149416 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149416_0149507 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149507_0149838 What's the I in TFIDF?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149838_0149964 İnverstek
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149964_0150187 term for this investment.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0150429_0150823 I did do it once, I do have a Java class that does it for some thing, I don't know whether it would work or not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0152722_0153001 We've also got a key word to give you an all new type of set.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153001_0153109 You gotta do keyway to that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153109_0153454 but you could do key words, that could be topics, that could be the same thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153454_0154048 Ystodd, mae'n ddweud o'r cyfwyrd, mae'n ddweud o'r cyfwyrd, mae'n ddweud o'r cyfwyrd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0154203_0154315 foolish to sell me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0155341_0156222 I suppose even calculating the voices faces themselves would be too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0156222_0157189 The easy bit is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole characters in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157189_0157624 because you don't have to integrate as much. Yeah, definitely. Information.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157973_0158359 No, you can do you can do search without TFID if you just can't rank the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0158970_0159494 No, no, no, that's not what the idea was in the first place, to rank the results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160264_0160488 Yeah, but that went slow down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160488_0160600 Ranking once that down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161107_0161604 It still uses it a bit far but it ranks the results by the amount of fat. That would just be nice extra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161604_0161818 I thought that was part of it, but yeah, it doesn't move.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162242_0162710 No, we didn't. So what? Is there any interview? Yeah, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162977_0163392 But yeah, I guess if that's not part of it, don't worry about it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0163561_0163750 because I'm only going to do this by the time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164726_0164813 We'll just give you a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164813_0165282 That was the whole point.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166295_0166492 Mae'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166492_0166721 Y tfidf yw'r informatio'r ysgol?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0167959_0168230 Felly mae'n ddweud i'r cwmdyn nhw.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0168416_0168525 Bull-
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169308_0169412 That's a compound there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169412_0169892 Well, it's not an address. It's a sunny day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169892_0170033 And I can add it to me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170303_0170774 ac mae'r ffordd yn ymddangos, mae'n ddweud y rhan ffordd yn ymddangos, yn y rhan.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170774_0171163 You could make it more complicated and make it... It's not making my company.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0171523_0171710 The way you were doing it, we were just looking for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172042_0172133 Well that's way worth it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172133_0172283 이따가
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0173224_0174008 Ac mae'n gweithio i'r ddweud y ddweud y tff, y ddweud y tf yn ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174008_0174408 and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174408_0174774 a'r hyn yn ymwneud ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn y
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174957_0175023 I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175023_0175228 It's pretty crude, anyway. It's just looking for...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175414_0175908 So what it's going to do is look for separate... Oh, because then it's going to go into the NST search and return that to it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175908_0176137 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176137_0176267 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176267_0176403 So yeah, that's less creepy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176403_0176608 Um
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177487_0177584 groups.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177584_0178053 Yeah, without doing any like, um, what? We're also like, too
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0178851_0179386 Yeah, that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179386_0179709 That's um, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179709_0179940 But the idea is that gives you the informatics thought.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179940_0180210 how you combine that is up to you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180210_0180351 I guess, there's lots of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180351_0180980 If you were this doesn't a whole lot about in Manning and should
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180980_0181393 They've got a whole chunk about it, so just IRs in this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181393_0181581 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181581_0181729 Felly, mae'n gwybod yn fwy o'r chathol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181729_0181889 if you haven't got it, so I'm coming.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182495_0182581 You
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182581_0182878 hundreds of videos.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0187627_0187906 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188687_0188748 Yeah, I guess I
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188748_0188875 Yeah, I guess that's...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0197880_0198070 They can have safe references.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198070_0198284 Can have a safe reception if it's this again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198795_0199338 Well, call it favourites then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199338_0199448 You can have a fight.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199722_0200105 Yeah it's not enough in relation. It's not like they come back every day and do the same.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0201502_0201561 Bye.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0204803_0204956 Yeah, it would be quite a good bit of a haziah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0205719_0206009 That's not what I'm suggesting. I'm just saying like these are
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207456_0207592 well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207592_0207657 I mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208096_0208257 Yeah, we'll search, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208257_0208441 So even if it just had two things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208441_0208990 Ie ddim yn ymwneud yma, ddim yn ymwneud i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r gweithio i'r
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208990_0209204 And then another one that said search the largest instance.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209204_0209467 like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209594_0209856 Yeah, or one, yeah, one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211013_0211248 Well the other thing to do is just search the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211248_0211482 mae'n ddweud yn ymddiad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211482_0211798 And that's the interface. You just go from there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212121_0212516 ac nid ydy'r brwser o'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212516_0213348 or the search, but the search meant I could have on it something that said just as a drop down menu that says just an a go button that said take me to this. Oh I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213348_0213571 So that's the end?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213571_0214400 So the only thing that comes up when you finish is a, when you start, it's just one window like that. And it's got all the search stuff right down there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214400_0214615 So this is your search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214615_0215164 just all here and here is just go to wherever on the go button.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215164_0215514 Ac ddyn nhw'n ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r dd
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215704_0216048 And the topic says welcome to our browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0216813_0216963 Drop down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217344_0217656 Ah, you won.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217831_0217942 That's okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0218438_0218515 Yeah, that's true.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229192_0229367 If they do, they wouldn't speak, if they're doing such.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229367_0229594 It's not the same. It's doing the quick access.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0236408_0237040 I think the N ones are interfaces and the N1, one of the ways around ones are interfaces and ones actually are an implemented class.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237040_0237498 Because if you go back enough, then what's his name?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237498_0237773 The API is alright but there's not a lot of description in it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237773_0237959 Yeah, it's very good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237959_0238103 And most

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239480_0239560 So, okay, what's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239583_0240106 It's an implementation of an N text interface.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240106_0240169 What's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240169_0241198 I'd say extended version of it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0242760_0242869 Might be useful, wouldn't it?

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0006711_0006820 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0010769_0011623 One thing that I was wondering is there standard control that you use to connect the different things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0011623_0012020 like you're hearing the topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012020_0012646 Is there a particular type of control that like is one of these NXT or something? Night controls?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012646_0012722 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0015854_0016228 You haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016228_0016669 like other topics where we're going to do it for speaker ideas in the restaurant.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016669_0016708 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016779_0017338 Okay, when we talk about speaker characterization, how are we accessing the list of speakers?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026808_0026979 Ja, dat is niet het smil, dat is niet het smil.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026979_0027329 Like when he was talking about like how an architecture that things are gonna plug into yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027329_0027798 I mean, so the things are all modular. I mean, it would be a good idea for you to have the same idea for anything else for you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027798_0027954 for what else we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027954_0028342 Yeah, actually even the searches or whatever. Yeah, you can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0028342_0028849 I mean search results are all in a predictable thing with a name, certain properties or listed properties.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0033745_0033849 Whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034053_0034342 How you want to use it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034378_0034788 It's just a matter of deciding what would be easiest. Yeah, he's that all the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049224_0049723 So each time you're going straight to the XML files for the information? No, I thought it was an object file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049723_0049757 process.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049757_0049850 the whole of life.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049850_0049965 どうぞ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049965_0050004 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050258_0050422 i'r 1k.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050422_0050663 Felly mae'r prifroedd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051309_0051345 So what you do is you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051959_0052044 Right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0052811_0053116 This is a list. Is it for the entire corpus?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053116_0053476 Or is it just like individual ones like one one object for one object which means
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053476_0053540 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053540_0053686 Ama bu çılgın bir kez.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053919_0054132 I wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054132_0054324 Well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054355_0054385 It's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054871_0054911 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0056609_0057022 or just return an all or a... No, just make a specified idea, have a default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0060208_0060258 Das ist das
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071484_0071909 Actually, I can upload my stuff as well. I just have to make one change to your phone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071909_0072240 just to load this one instead of the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0072240_0072566 So, two lines of code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073070_0073163 What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073336_0073698 Well, yeah, just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074114_0074311 I'll call your version.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074427_0074693 I did it in my directory. Just do it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074876_0075176 I have a copy, yes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075176_0075245 I'm down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075245_0075906 But I will just go into update time and just make sense that things can come to an end.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076114_0076300 And then update.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076547_0076744 Yeah, it hasn't happened in a million changes to it yet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076744_0076902 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076902_0077102 Y'all just make that one and let you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077311_0077597 Like I said, two wins a go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077597_0078132 And then you can play.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078132_0078233 There's not much to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078233_0078625 have to get better results
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078938_0079543 And just to wire in the topics.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0079543_0080115 I mean the highlighting stuff. Well also yeah like that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080115_0080211 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080297_0080874 and just want to find out what kind of objects those were for the elements.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080874_0081304 So it goes in the handles.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0082326_0082359 on the phone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085593_0085681 Okay, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085892_0086548 There's a few more things to do with that and then once Vanilla gets the index
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086548_0086820 So, the next one, you kind of fall.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086820_0087170 I was just wondering if you had to, well the way you were doing it, I was going to ask if the way you were doing it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087170_0087588 You're reloading like a new corpus each time for each meeting, but you're doing the objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087588_0088289 So you don't need to just because if we do have like the inverted search says that there's the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0088289_0089001 10 documents or we're going to have to load each of these 10 corp rules just to do the individual next case range.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0089380_0089533 They probably...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090150_0090373 Fine
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090373_0090406 Do them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090860_0091294 If you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine, but if you don't then you won't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091294_0091408 That's insane.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091738_0092049 아직 안 되었냐고
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0093795_0093898 So that's enough.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099112_0099725 It's more than an SD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099725_0099959 I know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099959_0100154 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100154_0100590 We have to, you know, while we're debugging.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100590_0100987 But no, it was something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103440_0103544 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103783_0103949 And that because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104515_0104905 I'm just gonna ask if we should assume that they'll want to load a meeting first but not necessarily
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104905_0105239 I guess if you're doing a search on the entire... Yeah, I mean...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0105765_0105892 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0106555_0106792 Well, we can put it together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107270_0107714 I could probably even. That shouldn't be too hard to put a chuck in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107714_0107884 And if it hasn't voted, then portion to order.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111723_0111938 Unless they know what me to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111938_0112083 Well, it's one of the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0113546_0114127 Well, the things I made just be looking for a word and, you know, looking for shows up at ten different meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114127_0114868 then at that point they'll probably want to, like if it goes up by default, it goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are real time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114868_0114978 I don't know what to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115184_0115431 Well, I'm like to water. Like the thing is, I think...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115580_0116003 Like when it loads up it'll load up the transcript window in the whatever window
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116003_0116206 I think just the topic goes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116206_0116826 Although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116826_0117456 So I'm just thinking if it's kind of like you're saying you have to have a normal object
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117456_0117835 I mean, before you do, insert your own little switch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117876_0117953 can do love also.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117953_0118007 That's right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118453_0118825 Yeah, but the global one feeds into the local.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118825_0119318 So for getting any usable data, it's going to be doing a search on each of those files.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0119318_0119664 So it's going to be loading up each of those? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0120470_0120896 But it could be time consuming, like if there are 10 documents that...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121424_0121743 Um, yeah, well, just thinking of some way we could, you know...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121743_0122317 to change the results in a nice little format that will make things a bit easier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0122317_0123043 But the thing is, I mean, if we've got that, then it's going to be needing really to load the entire corpus for that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123043_0123539 if it's trying to show us where those were, if it's trying to hang like those in the text, transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123539_0123775 And we're going to have to have all that other data in them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123775_0124048 So each time when they're searching, when they have like, you know,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124048_0124307 We're going to attend different meetings. The word wireless comes up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124307_0124688 go to meeting one and test it. Reload the normal object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124688_0124836 That's one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124836_0125272 I mean that's kind of... Yeah, it's not too slow though, I think. It's not too bad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125272_0125338 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125539_0126076 It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126076_0126392 Tested 抓紧玩具Shut down 问了
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126392_0126975 So just sort of based on that as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126975_0127464 But if it doesn't take that long each time, then it should be alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0128741_0128774 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0129973_0130006 It's all good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0130824_0131060 These are the new trucks.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131060_0131406 in that way, I think specifically which meaning it is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131406_0131880 because I'm sure they don't want to have extra loading time, either, if they can avoid it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131880_0132180 So yeah, or they can check them out. They can just the ones they want to check.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0132988_0133108 I think they were in the text
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0133108_0133838 We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of be DB, you know, just do it. There is, yeah, in one of the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134088_0134278 Evet, evet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134278_0134441 You mean just this? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134441_0134649 Like the work that it's part of.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134767_0134902 ..y'r probiwys ysgwyser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135309_0135394 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135999_0136107 See if it's accurate.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0138712_0139019 Do you actually need the frequencies?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139480_0139554 Oh, right, that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139574_0139634 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140160_0140436 Well, things if it's being done. If somebody's down the key.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140755_0141096 There's a class she's trying to get to work on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141096_0141729 They did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141729_0142205 But it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff, but it, the last time it already wasn't working.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142205_0142825 She's going to look at a more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142825_0143125 But if we need the, if we do need the frequencies.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143368_0143467 Um, I don't
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143784_0144054 It would have been like a lot of stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0144389_0144452 What's this sample?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147353_0147533 cool cross the court and steal data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147533_0147825 So yeah, probably Trump.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147825_0148187 Plasys Doplys, so you remove stuff that doesn't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0149632_0149922 What's the I in TFIDF?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0150668_0150690 on the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158468_0158525 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158525_0158712 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158712_0159014 I mean we're just like oh for your stuff I guess.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0159014_0159111 I know, that's what was-
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0161982_0162591 Non mi dico che io non lo dico.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162649_0162718 Yeah, I totally agree.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162718_0162746 and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0163504_0163648 Yeah, I'm just kidding.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0164960_0165013 You know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165013_0165350 Actually, because I mean this is your top one and this is your bottom. Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165350_0165897 But the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting, if they're looking for particular term or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165897_0166317 They just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and when to see it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0167571_0168186 If it's like a two word term, does it TFIDF?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168186_0168529 It's not a compound now, it's just two words together. Bull-a-wuh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168529_0168814 um in
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168814_0168924 강조
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168924_0169280 just something like a head and brow university.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169446_0169675 I'm not sure what I'm saying.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169675_0169803 Sunny day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169803_0169843 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0170922_0171222 Let's not make it more complicated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171385_0171739 Because the thing is, the thing is that the way we were doing it, we were just looking for the words.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171739_0172055 period each word in the index.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172055_0172193 Well that's way worse.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172193_0172508 And then it's just saying, were these two words in any of these documents?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172508_0173238 and then if it wasn't we'd go closer and do the next research. Yeah. Look for the exact term or the regular expression.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0175914_0176170 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176170_0176242 Let's do this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176617_0176931 I'm just wondering if it's going to give us something cool, then absolutely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176931_0177652 But if it's sort of like, if the NXT search is still gotta be run to find these terms or these groups.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0177957_0178333 or also like do wild cards work for something like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178333_0178889 So if you're looking for a wireless wired wire, blah blah blah, you can do wire with a star.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178889_0179192 Actually that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179192_0179324 So, first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179324_0179364 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179683_0179870 But the idea is that gives you the feeling
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180329_0180467 Let's try.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180467_0180583 Okay, I don't...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180583_0180653 will.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181036_0181057 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181454_0181530 Alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181880_0182342 Yeah, I've got some somewhere.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182591_0182876 hundreds of figures.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182876_0183163 Do the PDF, switch it to PostScript, switch it back to PDF.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183580_0183640 Ugh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183640_0183894 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0184522_0184819 Oh, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0186835_0186923 for being.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0187258_0187797 Probably for the most part, I mean there'll be a set of people that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188405_0188759 Search for stuff. Start working.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188759_0189152 I guess that's my brows. Okay, like search browse
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189349_0189594 like if you're looking for something specific.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189594_0190013 like if they know exactly where they want to go, they want to go to that meeting on December 3rd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190401 Yeah, I want to look
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0191972_0192304 Brows by meeting, browse by speaker.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192304_0192679 No, I'm just thinking of different ways we can do that, like different buttons on the top.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192679_0193086 like if they're looking for a particular person, particular working group, particular whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193086_0193671 And we just, we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193671_0193905 where we could keep it more genuine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195177_0195627 Yeah, but I'm just thinking like initially when they load up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195627_0195904 What are the range of things that they'd want to do?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195904_0196265 Like if they're part of X working group, they'll want to get in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196265_0196481 Do we want to save preferences?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196786_0197287 Well, if they're part of BDB working group, they're going to want to look at the BDB ones and some default to that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197287_0197384 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197610_0198058 based on what they did the last time. They can have the safe preferences.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199005_0199280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199424_0199910 Okay, yeah, it's not enough in relation is not
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200239_0200457 Мой!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200457_0200585 You
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200585_0200849 I forget.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200922_0201065 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201065_0201541 Well, no, I'm just getting back to the sort of what could be on the startup screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201541_0201912 like there's just a range of things we could do. We could have like search options, browse options.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201912_0202445 I'm just playing around with idiots.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0202445_0203527 And then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say, well, if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203527_0203630 and then do this ball.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203630_0203968 So we can sort of guide them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203968_0204271 and it's just like, hey, my task is to do this and there's a button.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204271_0204383 Perfect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204383_0204496 You're welcome.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204496_0204529 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204529_0204737 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205682_0205884 No, let's not worry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205884_0206558 I'm just saying like these are just like a lot of programs both kind of lame programs do have that sort of thing first
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0206558_0207407 just because they don't want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly use tasks or just exit and just let me use the program.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207407_0207598 So, well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207992_0208211 Probably worse search or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209137_0209471 I just instantly, I got the search like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209471_0209691 Nie, tak czy nie?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0210971_0211077 such as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217577_0217753 Well, we don't actually have user names, do we?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217753_0218050 We're going to tell these codes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218519_0218657 In a case like that, we do want proctone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218657_0218789 we don't want them to type them to.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219359_0219525 and allow multiple
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219563_0219865 Okay, you're just looking for one specific.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0221052_0221142 Amazing one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0224492_0224581 until then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0227069_0227251 Yeah, that's the way.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230548_0230731 you go over there. Then that doesn't get any better.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230731_0230930 Не, мы не на собесаде
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234609_0234815 I'n ddod i'r moddol yw'r wyf.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234815_0235146 I think in that case it's the right corpus.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235146_0235208 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235208_0235417 Yn ymwneud, mae'n gwybod.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0236358_0236513 Yeah, next one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0239953_0240051 It's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240638_0240914 No, no, no.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240914_0240980 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0241644_0241921 I'm really just gonna keep on going
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0242621_0243025 Might be useful when I'm afraid of tomorrows.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0243877_0244106 and we won't have to have a meeting with Steve on Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244106_0244159 portal.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244241_0244628 So do we want to arrange this, get this one earlier?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244628_0244888 through you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245098_0245167 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245587_0245678 Okay, yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246596_0246706 possibly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246706_0246996 Usually by name. So, need a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246996_0247596 Although, well, I don't know, because it's a lie-off and trying to get some work done for the political.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248060_0248216 Okay, right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248216_0248298 and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248688_0248940 Three o'clock.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248940_0249187 Thanks for the early one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249187_0249353 No, maybe I did not show up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249353_0249436 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249767_0249998 because I think she's got a class at 11.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249998_0250371 On va prendre 1,3, ça prend presque 12.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250371_0250565 Shall we say?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250776_0250894 Or if you could try it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250894_0251001 We could try short and out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251001_0251148 One year.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251148_0251339 Well, it wouldn't be a long reading, though.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251339_0251379 money.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251379_0251707 Would you want that? No, probably not.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251707_0251921 If one's bad for you then you won't come.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252235_0252278 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252855_0252933 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259469_0259873 There's just sort of the basic implementation stuff that I was wondering about.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259873_0260094 I'm not sure if I'm...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260094_0260376 Что ж, подпросим.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260376_0260692 Did we decide whether to be ranked?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260798_0260979 Well, basically
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0261426_0262136 Nice at the end. I can't get thinking about it. It would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262136_0262837 just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document, it's not really getting them together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262837_0263091 Thank you for someone's looking for a particular term.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263091_0263526 I don't know, just don't know if it would bring us that much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263668_0263708 Also.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264093_0264561 If they're looking for like a sunny day and
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264561_0264931 you know, Sunny shows up in this document, Day shows up, we're gonna have to gather.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264931_0265179 Um, or if there are two.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0265179_0265811 It just doesn't, you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0268462_0268812 And that's for single tabs, it would be very useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0269500_0269766 It's just going to be simple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270757_0270985 penalize it you could just put a way to do the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270985_0271210 just still do the NXT search then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271210_0271367 Yeah, you do the NXT show, so that's a show.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271367_0271506 something together either just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271599_0271853 waiting against it. So how many pairs you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271853_0272207 wouldn't show up on the search results if it didn't exist.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0272813_0273225 We'll have to talk to her and know about this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0273225_0273883 We are using that. I mean, it does make sense for that. But actually...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274305_0274557 some things you're gonna get a lot of results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274879_0275247 I don't think it's a squishy cup. I mean, if it's my own. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275247_0275434 Yeah, okay, I'll see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275434_0275852 I think we could actually put that on the list of meetings that get returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275852_0276514 yw'r 15 yma yw'r llangwyddiadau, a'n gweithio'n ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddwe
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0276514_0276625 Okay, we'll see you then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278040_0278313 The things, I mean, that'll be exactly how we're doing it now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278313_0278617 like we're just looking for the two words separately to see if they exist in the same document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278617_0278907 if they do them, there's possibility that they occur together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278907_0279111 And then we do the annexing circle in that document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0279318_0279373 So it's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280821_0280998 Um, well right now it's not doing anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280998_0281269 I don't know what to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281269_0281344 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281344_0281597 They're all at 75, I've been eating.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281597_0281750 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0282891_0282954 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0283224_0283732 Yn ymwneud yma, yw'r ysgol yma, mae'r ddaeth.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0287628_0287707 Yep.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0002063_0002511 It's okay every time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0004128_0004707 Стой, смотри
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0006734_0007677 I'm gonna have fun dropping this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0007677_0008425 It's very, very fascinating.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0008425_0008509 Are they all in there?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0011420_0012024 No, that's just summary. No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012024_0012207 But, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012207_0012328 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019391_0019703 Seems I like this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019703_0020121 Go peace, dear.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0021504_0021700 I'm gonna cry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0024953_0025451 They live there
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0026983_0027218 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0028081_0028133 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0033434_0033643 ¡Pati, no me lo es!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0035739_0035785 many.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0039504_0039938 But that took me so long to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0042040_0042072 haven't done
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0052524_0052865 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0068919_0069261 I'm always interested in this guy because he sees me funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0069261_0070287 Yeah, I'm gonna say. It's taking the next joke. That'd be quite good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0084666_0084871 Yn y top left.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087192_0087460 We have a big yellow one there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087460_0088218 What have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0088236_0089082 Yeah, I think so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0089082_0089224 ん
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0095446_0096325 We have to remember to include that in our evaluation how did the... I think it improved your browsing. Yes!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0099902_0100259 I guess that's why we have separate speech lab.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0100305_0100661 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0101446_0102253 I'm running some troubles with the in-mitting but I found another package instead of writing it from the scratch.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0102253_0102750 I don't know. Just know if I haven't put on it much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0103034_0103425 We'll see what happens in the next video.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0104085_0104232 Well, there's many...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0105967_0106108 I just want to try that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108083_0108360 I didn't expect this course to be so much of a job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108360_0109058 Yeah, it's a job
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0109058_0109200 Practical job
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0114513_0115039 I thought we changed it to the 10th or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0115201_0115311 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120108_0120189 So we can say why.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120308_0120594 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120594_0120764 and that will give us the idea.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121032_0121596 I've got my DNLG presentation on Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0121596_0121866 It's too much now.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0141775_0142184 It's not good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0142276_0142587 Not a good idea.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0143202_0143253 Thank you.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0155606_0155728 Oh, it's actually 24.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160131_0160714 Did he say anything about what he expects of the final report and stuff?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160714_0160855 I can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162302_0162513 Although it's 15%
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162725_0162808 I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0163258_0164252 Because this, I mean, we have interim reports of seven pages. And that's, we can, seven pages. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164252_0164518 We could probably just expand that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164660_0164909 I mean, a lot of it's gonna be the same thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165229_0165633 And then I mean write about the evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165633_0165800 Yeah, that's a big deal.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165915_0166112 I don't think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166261_0166473 She's gonna be...

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0199631_0199794 again, just key topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200307_0200435 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200435_0200738 Can you make them?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0202466_0202569 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0202681_0202785 Tack för den starten.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0216482_0217203 see what Sleaze says about real valuation and then like we'll keep in touch by email from you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0217410_0217555 I guess we'll see.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0217789_0217848 and month.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0002312_0002562 Oh dear.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0002952_0003133 But dream, dream like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0003133_0003297 What is that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0003494_0003547 my list.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0004996_0005368 Ah, sabotage.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0007291_0007454 Yeah, fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0010815_0011006 He wants to, like, some written...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0011888_0011939 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0012734_0013051 Have you changed the idea?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013694_0013806 Joo, se on hyvä.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013999_0014535 No, when you said it at the beginning I thought, must check that we write and then...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0017326_0017558 Счастливо!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0018698_0018894 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0019388_0019671 Seems I like this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020309_0020675 There is a file in the directory called disful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020863_0020953 I was
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022810_0022869 Thank you very much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022869_0023008 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023380_0023460 All right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023621_0024047 Yeah, that was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025012_0025312 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025312_0025661 I don't know if they lived there, but they saw it even more stuff there, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0026400_0026858 What? Actually, do you know how to do it now? Okay. So we probably won up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0027366_0027487 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028244_0028456 Has anyone had time to play with it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028841_0028914 comments.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0030210_0030251 keep
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031013_0031119 My
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031119_0031314 It doesn't really do anything, so...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031314_0031602 The thing is that, yeah, there is, as I said, a while ago.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031602_0032314 there is still this one error which is bugging in NXT and that always generates these
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032314_0032693 I think when you left click or right click or something, I can't remember now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032835_0033593 But if it's a real error then it stops. Yeah, I didn't discover any of those yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035556_0035682 Yeah, we're good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035682_0036229 Is there any comments you have about just like wording or some sort of minor things?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0036931_0037073 A lot of this job is done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037073_0037439 At the moment as well the whole windows are pop up are not pretty tall.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037439_0038026 but I would make them a bit nicer if I had more time, but it doesn't look like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0038026_0038251 No, it's not, it's not, it's not the top.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0039715_0040133 But that took me so long to do this playstyle.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040229_0040610 So I'm quite glad that it looks, you know, nice on one road on this kind of road.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040826_0040967 No, this is just, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043111_0043280 Oh, God.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043872_0044186 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0044186_0045922 I've done some like a couple of things to do. Really sweet. Yeah. Try that a few times. Yeah, I started using your, the speaking, I don't know if you've seen that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046694_0046770 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046770_0046985 But it's good. Your sound is really good. Good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046985_0047241 He's got a good interface and he's used.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0047241_0047277 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050087_0050345 So I'll go into that and then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050983_0051183 is when they say, mm, uh-huh, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051521_0051791 I don't know, that's very... It's kind of boring. Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051791_0051870 It's very...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0052391_0052733 Is that a sleeper thing?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0053528_0054020 So which, you know, suggest, maybe you can suggest a few that which would be interesting to list.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054020_0054141 Like, seriously?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054999_0055042 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059149_0059684 I mean do we care if you don't know what doesn't really matter?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059782_0060580 But it would be difficult if in the speaker characterisation window we had a head-in top five dialogue ads.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0060580_0061211 and then the little brackets but they're not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are, you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0062130_0062233 Felly ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063316_0063513 No, I wouldn't. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063921_0064001 So when it comes out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064597_0064749 I'n ddweud yma i'r ddweud, ac yn ymwneud yma.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064997_0065404 Yeah, just do top five, both local and global, and then have another.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0065511_0066137 But then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0067354_0067828 You fall out of your summer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068535_0068751 Yes, that's what speaking characterization gives you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068933_0068999 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0070291_0071373 So is this percentage then? If you say like joke for the speaker is percentage
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0071373_0072234 I like 20. Is that the... What percentage of his speech is joke or... What percentage of the dialogue is...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0072390_0072533 in the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0076024_0076748 Yeah, I mean, just keep it simple.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079148_0079241 You will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079655_0079701 So good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0080298_0080635 Yeah, I was thinking that. It sort of turned out that way, didn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081393_0081435 one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081435_0081503 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081701_0081788 Oh.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0083604_0084156 I have one little question that I reckon we should have a little icon for on our browser.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084458_0084804 Wel, nid.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084804_0085504 The man they've got on X which is you know NXT and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that. Yeah it was something else.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0085748_0086228 No, not something original.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086228_0086606 I love your subject.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086606_0086931 The only thing I could think of was an M. Yeah, I know, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0087488_0088107 What have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089655_0089703 謝謝
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089864_0090401 I mean it's tiny so we can't really put more than one character in it.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092316_0092511 Wel, ydych chi'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni'n gwybod ni
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092623_0092786 Alwch chi'n gweithio'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093222_0093399 I'm not sure, I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093399_0093461 It's pretty easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094007_0094383 Yeah, yeah, I know how to put it there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094383_0094598 But I'll have to import it somehow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094598_0094669 e não é uma coisa que eu não vou te dizer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094912_0095078 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0096698_0096891 Can you even hear me?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0097278_0097652 Welcome, it's another meeting. Can we get sound on these machines? No, let's go.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0098936_0099810 if the sound card is registered to your name, which it usually is not. And you have to reboot. Sometimes it does all that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0109184_0109734 That's it's NXT package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110371_0110848 I mean sometimes they have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110848_0111427 I think it was like right I'll try this then see what it does
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0114594_0114697 I thought we said
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116565_0116699 Like a T
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116932_0117417 Well that's the problem because Steve hasn't given us any details.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118045_0118119 That's sort of
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118486_0118681 I'm sure actually
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118798_0118957 Just brainstorming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119308_0119597 The thing is, yeah, we had the deadline last Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119597_0120310 but we won't be able to do any evaluation during the weekend anyway. So I think we could set Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0120589_0120727 And that would give us the idea.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124504_0124539 好久不見
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124539_0124631 I think that's why
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125696_0125814 push it off.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125814_0126195 at the end we'll say you never gave us any tests like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126439_0126709 Well, sort of, that's how I am. He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126709_0126933 He would make something up. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126933_0127272 Yeah, I find some people who are interested in it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0127272_0127400 The thing is,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0128207_0129005 Felly, ydych chi'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, roeddwn i'n gwybod, ro

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130084_0130181 It's so good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130181_0130389 It's any minute you're gonna be hot now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0131849_0132005 like highly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132005_0132102 I'm not.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132203_0132302 I don't have to be you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0133368_0133554 I was thinking like 10.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135493_0135700 We don't want to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135848_0136057 What else do we do?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137042_0137183 There should just have two
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137207_0137686 Мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам,

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139183_0139283 nearly two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139470_0139766 Oh, it's true. Yeah, it's two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139766_0140033 Do we have to have done the evaluation by then?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141001_0141075 I understand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141075_0141211 24th
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141211_0141299 Yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141791_0141925 It's not good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0142694_0142974 I'm sure on the website it says Thursday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0143656_0144109 Y cwestiynau yw'r ysgolwyddiadau ymdweud yma?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144673_0144807 We should definitely ask him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144807_0144937 Because if not then...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0146055_0146174 Yeah, you're gonna be right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0147522_0147750 Felly mae'n gwybod i'r rai'r gweithio.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148526_0148668 Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148668_0148771 It's like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0149119_0149585 Wel, rwy'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'n
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0150257_0150782 I mean I'm not really... Because I don't have anything after the activity.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0151069_0151276 What does it mean?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0152163_0152341 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0155338_0155536 Yn ymwneud yw'r ffansie i'r rhaid i'r hyn o'n e-mail.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0156342_0156473 Да.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157162_0157354 but it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157354_0157436 as a part of the demo.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157584_0157793 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157793_0158247 Rwy'n credu i'r ffordd y pryddysgu'r ysgol.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158247_0158353 And...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158660_0158735 What was the other one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158872_0159599 Felly, yna'r ystod y gallwn i'r ysgol yma?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0159599_0160018 We've got people we have for us. What you thinking? When?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0161530_0161870 Do we know? Did you ever say how long it was supposed to be?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162181_0162365 I'm just doing homework.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162784_0162869 But we can rely a lot.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162869_0163120 I think we should, we should write everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0164008_0164164 It's a big yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0165590_0165676 Yeah, let's go.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0166237_0166299 Actually
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167052_0167284 So, do you want to write him an email then? Sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167284_0167326 Let me get you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167850_0168296 and when I get home today which will be before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0168622_0169192 Felly, yn ymgyrch ar 6 oed, mae'n meddwl y ffaith yn ymgyrch.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169318_0169404 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169404_0169517 Well, I will
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169906_0170600 Well I will need your snippets of code or if it would be good if I had them by tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0170935_0171105 I was gonna ask
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171289_0171434 at the moment you're searching Windows.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171565_0171657 How's it organized?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172507_0172809 but at the beginning, when you haven't searched yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172809_0173357 Yn ymwneud, mae'n ddweud yma yn y ddweud, ac mae'r ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0173882_0174181 And then if you, I don't know, double click on one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0175887_0175963 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0176802_0177381 Well, this is a jaguar, by the way. Yeah, I can. It's beautiful. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0177559_0178451 Yn ymwneud, ychydig yn ymwneud yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma, yma,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178805_0178847 with the other.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178969_0179185 various like yeah in the topic
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0179185_0179812 Usually one life click it's highlights it cross highlights everything I think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181008_0181185 It's difficult because...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181679_0181767 We need to go through this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182347_0182533 It's difficult.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182533_0182797 because the transcription window does cross highlighting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182924_0183290 in a very awkward way because he has to find the topic first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183290_0183584 That was okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183744_0184682 and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0184682_0185363 And that works when you left double click on a topic, on a meeting, sorry, then it loads it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185470_0185530 so you could
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185645_0185769 you could take that for loading.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185971_0186525 So if we have the same on this one, at least that you, if you double left click, then loads.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187847_0187994 Highlights.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187994_0188550 I mean obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here. But also highlights
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0188848_0188969 She's difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0189484_0190231 because you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be open. Well I suppose if you have a local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190231_0190333 then it could cross our nose.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190932_0191506 Because you know, if you get back several different meetings here and you've only got one meeting open then you can't cross out anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0193267_0193395 I want to stop.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0194506_0194561 So, that's all I wanted to say.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0195663_0195780 Well, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0196279_0197295 Well, in any case, if you left click on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open, then it should cross highlight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0197295_0197410 If not, you can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200617_0200677 기념해 이거
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200781_0201493 Is it very difficult to make another gooey but only for a global search?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0201930_0202490 just just take that away the local checkbox
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202490_0202650 Because they're not familiar.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202772_0202979 Yeah, because in the start of screen you can't have it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203231_0203342 Yeah? Would you make that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203342_0203575 That'd be handy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203575_0203798 Everything else can just stay the same, you know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203798_0204134 and if I can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbox.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0204584_0204934 Ready to go?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0216087_0216123 Are we done?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007053_0007312 See you face!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007312_0007390 I'm not gonna stay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0011917_0012147 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0017470_0017772 It's just a little chaos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0019495_0019601 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0020970_0021307 I think yeah, I saw that and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0022410_0023001 It doesn't have anything in it. It has about three lines of XML.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023214_0023273 What's that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023775_0024183 Just simply occupied
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024183_0024302 That's best to write those letters.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024302_0024419 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024562_0025175 I have lots of stuff in there yesterday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025175_0025310 It's just dumb.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025310_0025643 I don't know how you live there, but there's all that even more stuff there, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025643_0025952 I was unzipping all these kind of crazy huge things that were in the box.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025952_0026083 I needed them, they were for this much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0026083_0026667 It's alright, brother. I was going to quote on that one. What? Actually, do you know how to tweet out?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027076_0027357 Yn ymwneud, mae'n 8gig o'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027357_0027476 Gracias.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027476_0027982 Das ist ein must-bege-dein-hole-Wahlheim, aber ich weiß es nicht.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028614_0028945 Maar blijf ik? Eerst twee comments?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028945_0029123 Uh, now it's good, really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029123_0029191 謝謝
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029599_0030007 Mae'r bwysig yn y bwysig yn y bwysig.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0030007_0030205 but they didn't cause any problems but it just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033280_0033537 Yeah, I didn't discover any of those yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033537_0033821 Good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033821_0034404 I've fronted it to see if it had right to, I didn't say that long then. It seemed alright really.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034404_0034674 and the startup screen is going to get a big spot right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034674_0034783 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036267_0036363 No, that's what I...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036363_0036835 Mae'r ddweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdwe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036835_0037111 This is obvious challenge.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038021_0038352 No, it's not. It's not. It's not the top priority.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038566_0038773 I think it'd look better on Windows as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038773_0039024 Cysylltu'r rhaglen yn ymddiad.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0039343_0039428 Actually, can we?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0040098_0040140 to the day.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0041480_0041897 Well, they are... they are... It's big characterizations finished.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042029_0042437 Mae'n dweud, mae'n dweud o'r objeu yn fawr, oherwydd mae'n dweud o'r adegau ar y cwmwys.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042437_0042884 Mae'r ddweud yn ffasgol o'r bwzariadau yn ymweld yn ymddangos i'r holl, ac nid o'r cyfnodd yn ymddangos i'r cyfnodd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042884_0043116 It runs it much faster than it will do it here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043276_0043666 Wait, that's... I just can't look to sit in the lab and wait half an hour.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043889_0044535 I've done something like that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0044535_0044929 You're really speedy up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045839_0045916 That's the way.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045916_0046646 Felly, mae'n ddweud i chi'n gwybod ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol, ac mae'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n ddweud i chi'n dd
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0046646_0046715 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047380_0047894 Dy dialogue ads er ôl dyn yn eich ar-amusig yn ymdweud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047894_0048815 But some of them, some of the things, actually what I wanted to talk about that little bit was there are some that occur all the time that I just, and I don't know how interesting there are.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0048815_0049448 So the first one statement is that it will I removed it because it was like everything is prefixed by statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0049448_0050088 every single dialogue act starts with a statement. So everybody's top dialogue act statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050088_0050129 So that's it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050245_0050314 So I'll go into that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050314_0050682 and then everybody, the next one seems to mostly be backchunked.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050682_0050792 I don't know what that means.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050792_0050952 Zuna is always a back channel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051210_0051277 Is that what that means?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051277_0051370 Oh, keep it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051370_0051605 Um, and then the other six
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051884_0051947 Some people don't know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051947_0052095 They're awesome people who don't do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052095_0052411 So yeah, you can see that they don't do that and they spot them there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052523_0052876 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052876_0053288 Some people have, and the acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time. Yes, no questions.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0053288_0053572 um uh what else could
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054120_0054797 That's the thing I thought I wanted to know whether or not we because at the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five or the top X
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054797_0055107 Felly, mae'r ddweud yn ddweud, mae'n ddweud yn ddweud yn ddweud, mae'n ddweud yn ddweud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0055107_0056001 ac ydy'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056001_0056677 and we'll give you that in top order as well or you can just search for each specific dialogette.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056677_0057267 ..y'r ffordd y gallwn yn bwysig yn cais yn y rhaid, yn y rhaid, yn y rhaid.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057267_0057447 bike.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057447_0057616 So, iddo i chi'n gwybod i'r ddysgled.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057616_0057967 That's what I'm asking you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0058705_0058934 All the love, all's like 25.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0059098_0059276 I mean, do what you can.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061270_0061732 I think we should have the global top five because each speaker has got a top whatever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061732_0062279 So just say one of the boxes just explains this is my top five dinogex for the speaker
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0062279_0062926 And then in the meeting you have what you can either have the most commonly occurring ones or you can have a list of each speaker's top 10 of X.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063063_0063146 Ilywethaf, ilywethaf.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063146_0063342 But it would start thinking about the space in you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063541_0063654 お肉たちの肉だね
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063654_0063991 Because it's a speaker window, the speaker character when it comes up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063991_0064404 So you've got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0064404_0064962 a'r 5th yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud ymwneud a'r 5th yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ym
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066048_0066086 that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066256_0066714 Ond ydy'r amlwg yn ymdweud y gallwn yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn ymdweud yma yn y
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066714_0067023 Well they do sometimes but they're not that common.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067023_0067170 One guy has top 5 jokes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067170_0067229 one of his
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067229_0067328 He's an underguer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067328_0067396 That's what I'm saying.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067426_0068442 This is good for browsing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0068558_0068633 That's what's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069233_0069679 It's taking me to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069860_0070409 That'd be quite good to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0072044_0072846 Cymru'r hyn sy'n gwneud y dylaiol yma'r hyn yn y gweithio a'r hyn yn ymgylchedd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073056_0073347 I think most things are coded with a dialog X.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073347_0073526 Y nôl yw'r mwcwyl wedi'i ddweud, ac mae'n gwneud yn y label.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073526_0073733 So I just think it will die as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073733_0073790 accessible.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073946_0074059 and statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074059_0074781 And also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something, so if I quote a joke to you, they separate that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074781_0075165 So they put the dialogue acts and they put the code on and they put that outside.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075165_0075639 Felly, rydw i'n meddwl i'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod, ond mae'n gweithio'r cyfnod.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075639_0075772 Yeah, somebody else is doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075772_0076025 So you have to be original about your material.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0076025_0076404 Oh, it's not correct.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077423_0077500 Yeah, that's what God did.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077500_0077559 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077673_0078155 Ja, das finde ich immer ein bisschen präuchig.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078155_0078195 for
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078195_0078339 But I think it's pretty much complete.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078339_0078429 So I'll do that tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078429_0078493 just put it out there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078493_0078683 I can't start using that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0080941_0081261 Nid oedd yn fawr yn gweithio i'r sgol.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081261_0081362 我可以站起来
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081863_0082071 Okay, put it in a package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082181_0082258 Thank you, Bob.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082410_0082679 Well, it doesn't seem to make any difference. I've never used drop-in packages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082679_0082941 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082941_0083101 obviously the same directory it works.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0083101_0083343 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0084289_0084638 You can double click on it. Well, no.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085342_0085510 Yeah, it was a sunny day.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085510_0085735 Just borrow a little Microsoft GIF like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087174_0087240 We have it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087458_0087887 What have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0089751_0089873 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0090954_0091434 Você quer me dizer que a minha sessão informática seria muito boa?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0091434_0092082 Mae'n rhan o'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093351_0093450 It's really easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093450_0094076 you do it in one of the whatever the main window is you do set gear force and set pixels on this
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094076_0094130 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094723_0094995 I think you just get a pharn on that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095198_0095345 Yeah, yeah, just, that's it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095345_0095469 É isso.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0096862_0097042 You can even have some sound when it comes on.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097042_0097588 Welcome to the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097588_0097750 No, that's not true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097750_0097841 Have to do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0098317_0098701 No, but I think if you put headphones in it'll just play, it's just normal.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0099842_0099951 Felly mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0106575_0107074 I still can't make it run TNT from the job. Maybe I'll try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107074_0107140 Yeah, you too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107140_0107443 Have you ever made it work? Well, sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0108805_0109267 It's a job. It's a practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0109598_0109694 Cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0110835_0110927 Yeah, I think it was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111060_0111155 So what does?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111299_0112231 It was plainly generated by going to generate Java.com and just went, it's not doing well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112554_0112756 It's good to know what methods are there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112756_0112904 without having to look at the source code.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112904_0112944 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0113268_0113370 business.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114442_0114592 진짜 이거지
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114592_0114681 I thought we see
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124630_0124769 We didn't have that meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124769_0124899 Mębis, czy stydaj, intu?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125011_0125070 send me an email.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125070_0125180 I probably will do anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126155_0126235 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126563_0126708 He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0132751_0132990 How am I going to be trying to use
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133265_0133358 Ready?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133528_0133914 No, it'll take forever and then you've got to analyse the results.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133914_0134088 Like the thing that
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0135705_0136941 Yeah, one computer scientist, one dude of the students.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0137100_0137490 I just have two. My bad.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139417_0139544 Oh, it's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139544_0139677 Yeah, it's two weeks later.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140616_0140712 수고하셨습니다
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140712_0140962 25th.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145149_0145491 We should have it, we should try and have it done by then anyway.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145491_0145868 Otherwise it was thought of as getting tight otherwise.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146247_0146629 We should aim to be finished by Monday, this Monday coming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146629_0146885 Mae'n gweithio, nid yw'n gweithio, ond mae'n gweithio.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146885_0147214 Stop the evaluation pretty much right away and then get
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147364_0147545 Yeah, and then get...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147696_0147872 We'll still write the report and everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147872_0147950 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150022_0150518 That's easy compared to my life.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205965_0206035 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206073_0206264 É, gente, é imparível, né?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206264_0206444 What? I think we're gonna bother with that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206444_0206625 Wel, y canol wedi cael ei wneud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206625_0206726 네, 다 저르네.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0207919_0208441 Well, we'll do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it. But we're not going to do it. At the very least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209642_0209821 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209821_0209934 Not a good day, though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209934_0210340 Well, even if I haven't managed to make it do some keywords.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210340_0210705 I don't think we can expect you to also come up with a certain effect as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210877_0210998 If you're quitting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210998_0211183 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211183_0211507 Ja, jeg var krævet i dag som jeg var fast, men jeg var ikke med med noget, eller hvad det var.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211507_0211992 I did have a look at trying to create XML files.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211992_0212200 yn tydlau ddach yn gael ymgyrch yn ymgyrch.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212200_0212531 Mae'n ddweud, mae'n ddweud yn ymddiad yma, mae'n ddweud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212531_0212781 but it's organizing the segment here to this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212781_0213044 It just looks so complicated to get it from.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0213203_0214288 Yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ym

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214959_0215201 Что это на...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218105_0218169 Yeah, with a
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218169_0218366 We need another meeting this week.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0004201_0004336 Oh.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0007493_0007587 It's so slippery.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0009133_0009200 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011344_0011435 I
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011435_0011518 that answer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011518_0011696 No, that's just summary.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011754_0011982 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012309_0012442 I'll write this one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012641_0012696 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012988_0013625 I didn't. I was trying to, I didn't have privileges to get into update your file.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0013625_0014060 I actually meant to send the email and then it just continued.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014324_0014843 Yeah, I forget mine as well, it's just like every time I put something in there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014843_0015002 Um, see ya'll soon.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015002_0015254 That was the main thing so as soon as that's in it will be ready.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015254_0015416 I was making a couple of little changes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015416_0015672 So those will be able to play with.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015672_0016188 Still working on the, trying to get the topics in summary search implemented as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016188_0016478 So that's where tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016478_0016680 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016680_0016966 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016966_0017340 I'm getting a better feel for all these night objects.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017545_0017761 It's just a little chaos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017761_0018272 I know it's like if you're gonna use this stuff later on in your life
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018272_0018612 and you spend the time to invest and learn all about them. But it's like, wow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018612_0018924 What's the minimum I can get away with?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018924_0019419 unless I want to do something with this in the future.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019590_0019753 All right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019753_0020065 Dear.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020065_0020117 Hmm?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020297 Anyway, so...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020934_0020962 I
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021106_0021208 I think if I get the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021208_0021506 I saw that and I'm just trying to remember I did create it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021506_0022321 I think I was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago so that may be mine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022549_0022601 Oh, really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022863_0022940 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022940_0023032 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023032_0023273 Yeah, it's not against the system.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023273_0023456 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023456_0023857 Um, that's how, yeah, that was, that was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024270_0024714 So it's not even the most important versions of what's happening.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024880_0025008 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025008_0025238 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025238_0025333 Hold the job check.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026232_0026377 I was gonna quote on that one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026377_0026667 What? Actually, they're not hatching me now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026667_0026774 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026774_0026982 So we probably won after we put them in.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0027676_0027902 C'est bon.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028023_0028142 I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028142_0028236 How's everything else going?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0029902_0029991 So, good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030189_0030281 Do you want to keep that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030281_0030441 Like are we keeping that how that happens?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030441_0031056 it just prints everything out in the in the shell as well because it does everything and just kind of I guess that's its default behavior.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031056_0031237 So it's just kind of doesn't really do anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031237_0031329 Stop.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0032007_0032077 I will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0034811_0035151 I was more or less just playing with the things that I had to do directly with what I was doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035151_0035394 So it didn't take it for a full test drive yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035394_0035525 You can do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035525_0035715 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0036863_0037115 This is the hardest challenge.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038183_0038603 I think it
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038603_0038718 It's getting a bit of a wind-eye desire.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038718_0038753 question.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038753_0038799 Merci.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0039372_0039778 Actually, can we run a company with this?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040120_0040237 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040589_0040879 Were you using like a GUI builder or just all from code?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040968_0041094 Okay, that's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041310_0041492 Just nice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041892_0041987 Okay?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043448_0043867 I have a white health at the door. Can you connect your home machine from here and then start it from there?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043867_0043909 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043909_0044253 No, it's right there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0044253_0044625 I've done some like a couple of things to be really sweet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0050822_0050856 is always a
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0051559_0051733 It's kind of boring.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0054913_0054979 it's a wherever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057759_0057819 I'm awesome.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057819_0058348 I know if we have like a choice so they can filter those out the top most common
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0058348_0058783 just say okay show all or show you know only the love
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059359_0059504 I don't know. It doesn't really matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059504_0059733 We just un-wetly filtered these out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0061216_0061303 I think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067906_0067986 She got
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067986_0068106 This is good for browsing though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068106_0068152 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068152_0068407 I mean that's sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068407_0068548 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068837_0068890 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0069493_0069749 It's taking me to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075358_0075462 Let's do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075513_0075642 I'll smile at you all anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077116_0077494 That's so that's sort of implemented now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077764_0077829 Yeah, just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0078649_0079199 I went up to it, and I'll just recompile the browsers and then just get that. You will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079280_0079699 also uses my private one in the search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0080103 Actually, do we have naming convention for our source files?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080103_0080384 Just prefix them with an N. Yeah, I was thinking...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080690_0080798 That's what we're going to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080798_0081025 Like for your stuff do you have?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081163_0081249 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081369_0081562 That doesn't mean it doesn't matter at this point.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081562_0081701 No, I'm just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081701_0081885 Oh, think about future stuff maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082092_0082165 Yeah, that's true too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082282_0082406 Yeah, it doesn't matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082770_0082939 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0084966_0085049 you know
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0085720_0085881 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086848_0086949 Yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086949_0086988 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0087619_0087884 I've never seen that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088088_0088254 Super-sized meeting browser.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088254_0088280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088280_0088700 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089258_0089791 just probably a basic text font and just something nice, something solid maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089791_0089834 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090132_0090202 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090375_0090402 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090402_0090808 Anybody have any, um, artistic talent?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091249_0091487 Cosmos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091487_0091840 I'm going to do something here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091917_0092258 I'll check to see if I can find any.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0092806_0093153 How do you add that to the Java program?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093153_0093342 Is it just baseball?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093342_0093493 It's really easy you do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094287_0094388 I'll put it down.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094440_0094501 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094688_0094729 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095016_0095251 Also it'll do the automatic scrunching down if it's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095251_0095320 До свидания.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0096153_0096712 Yes. Maybe it's a distinctive experience again.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097105_0097311 Welcome.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097451_0097610 Can we get sound on these machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097654_0098357 Have you ever managed playing any sort of music on the dice machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098357_0098436 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098676_0098758 Don't try it for any time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098758_0098971 If. Definitely front two. If.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0099427_0099484 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100612_0100744 Good luck, buddy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100972_0101247 Okay, well this looks good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103314_0103778 We're going to be trying to get the output from that. I don't know, still haven't found out if it's so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103900_0104113 feasible to open up more than one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104113_0104744 as many knob objects as we can for each meeting to do. Like we were going to figure that the ranking did make sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104744_0105104 like to be looking through the highest range ones first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105104_0105252 So we are going to look through only five and a half.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105252_0105882 just pick the top five to do the search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106821_0106975 I'm serious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106975_0107255 Maybe I'll try. Yeah, you can try. Maybe you might get wet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0107377_0107864 Well, it's up. Yeah, it'd be surprising to have a job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0108383_0108461 Не, это всё.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109005_0109126 Yeah, those are just like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109126_0109300 practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109808_0110031 How do you guys find the documentation for Next to You?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110161_0110304 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110304_0110440 I mean sometimes
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112103_0112218 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112218_0112577 Well, let's still, I guess, research platform.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112911_0113066 God's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113122_0113211 I'm just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113883_0114458 Did we have a date for when we actually want the system done?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0114458_0115163 I thought we said, yeah, I thought we changed it to the 10th or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115163_0115809 Because the thing is, I mean, we can keep working on little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115809_0115932 actually.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0116104_0116933 So I don't do we want to set an actual hard deadline or like when exactly where we're going to start the evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117358_0117427 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117427_0117920 Yeah, that's what we can still come up with, like test cases or whatever for the people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117920_0118139 come up with scenarios that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118139_0118504 I mean that's fairly straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118504_0118703 Thanks for your time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118703_0118805 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118805_0119034 Yeah, just brainstorming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120063_0120141 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120773_0120899 to work on it as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121052_0121445 I've got my DNLG presentation on hand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121445_0121759 Too much now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0122268_0122340 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123133_0123383 O'r prolyf yw'r dr Stephen yn ymddi'r pwyntio'r ffyrdd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123383_0123515 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123676_0123949 We'll probably just have our regular Tuesday meeting with him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123949_0124267 Like we could send him an email but I don't know if he's around either.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124267_0124755 She's out of line this week, isn't she? I think that's why we didn't have the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124939_0125003 Hmm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125180_0125261 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125261_0125430 although we really want the answer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125430_0125786 So if you don't ask, we can push it off.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127258_0127312 Yeah, that's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127630_0127793 Right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127793_0127917 We're looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129036_0129224 Yeah, if they have time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129224_0129346 I'm not satisfying people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129674_0129833 Yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130060_0130210 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130210_0130370 You're gonna be hot now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130898_0131310 Actually some other friends might have different programs, but it might be more willing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131310_0131482 Have more of a break.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131482_0131772 So then maybe get a range of types of people as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131772_0132330 like highly computer-like not you know, let it slitter it too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132330_0132565 Je pense que ça m'a fait éclat, ce soir.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132565_0132750 So the wider range of people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132950_0133165 I'm just thinking like three or four maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133165_0133775 No, take forever
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133872_0133975 Zanslılar
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133975_0134636 I think I did an HCI course a while ago and it's just, that's what they just, there's three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134718_0134790 That was fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134790_0135144 then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135305_0135407 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135407_0135572 We don't want to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135862_0136947 One dude off the street.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137425_0137628 That's good for you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137628_0137769 Um...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137769_0137988 But yeah, if he finds them, then that's cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137988_0138094 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'r bwysig.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138094_0138215 Bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138516_0138578 We have
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0139203_0139271 two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140242_0140610 I thought evaluation maybe for the report.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140610_0140752 So that's 20%
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140752_0140882 25th of July.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140882_0140970 I thought that was funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140970_0141080 That's what I understand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141247_0141500 I thought you said 24.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141500_0141952 Even though it's a good Friday. It's not a good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142066_0142163 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142163_0142403 Easter to you. Wow, it's not a good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142418_0142656 No. What wasn't originally on this?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142656_0143082 I'm sure on the website it says Thursday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143247_0143567 So that gives us two days to do the evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143567_0143766 No e-valuable.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143766_0143830 And you know that the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144144_0144408 I didn't think so necessarily.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144408_0144537 I wouldn't assume.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144537_0144643 But we should ask him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145641_0145965 That's probably tight otherwise. It's a good target.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145965_0146120 Спасибо
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147092_0147205 Just try what you can get.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147902_0148058 It's fun.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148058_0148276 It's just funny that I have it finished by Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148276_0148594 Because after Monday I'm pretty much free for about a week or so. Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148594_0149073 It's like, if we hadn't, you know, a bit more time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149456_0149558 Oh, the next one. Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149558_0149960 Yeah, I'm free after this Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149960_0150359 That's easy compared to the others.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150359_0150594 I mean I'm not gonna breathe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150724_0150827 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150827_0150890 今さ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151378_0151464 这就是咱
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151464_0151692 I'm gonna go.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151692_0151764 안녕
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151929_0152096 Ha ha ha.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0152773_0153143 If that was us, then not him. Yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153143_0153293 I like this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153647_0153757 Yeah, Thursday 24th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154007_0154164 deadline for submission.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154502_0154676 Well now you can. End of lectures.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155209_0155380 So, I'm going to start from the front.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155884_0156315 just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156649_0156753 Użychamy tam imię.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156753_0156839 Oh, yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157128_0157274 But it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157274_0157747 Is that a part of the demonstration?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0159586_0159628 forward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160781_0160938 a few little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160938_0161185 just made some comments at the last meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161185_0161535 Just generally how it all integrates blah blah blah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161535_0161657 Do we know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161997_0162216 I'd expect somewhere 10 to 15 pages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162406_0162725 Although it's 50% of the mark, I think, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162725_0162768 the same.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163174_0163343 Oh, we have a bit of time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163473_0163524 It's not because of the pandemic.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0164978_0165201 just to fine tune into detail.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165315_0165359 more.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165717_0166013 Yeah, that could be. That could usually be like five or six pages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169046_0169143 That's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169143_0169262 No big rush.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169501_0169604 although just together other ways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169604_0169952 So I'm trying to remember to do that tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0171732_0172201 just basic, pretty much like the intro. Do you want to have the intro?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0172201_0172565 just sort of like Google protection.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0173517_0173764 And as this comes up, it'll just pull on the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174233_0174429 It doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174429_0174744 That's the other big part.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174744_0175073 Felly, ychydig i'r cyfnod y cyfnod y dweud y dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r dwy'r
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175461_0175946 because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175946_0176441 That was why I'm sort of deciding to get the three pains in there instead of just the one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0176699_0177347 Yeah, so there's a couple of those little things. Yeah, beautiful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0177347_0177529 Yeah, and makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178574_0178779 Is that how it works in the other ones?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178779_0179183 in like the other windows, like various like, different topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0179927_0180420 If you have like a particular window that you want me to mimic its behavior.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180420_0180825 then just find it in the program and just say, okay, just have this one, does it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180825_0181051 So if it's like the topic window or whatever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0181663_0182241 So I can sort of trace back and figure out what objects they're bringing to you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0187581_0187863 So one left click just highlights.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188300_0188413 I'll just let him...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188570_0188695 the transcript or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0189392_0189561 İkiz yüklü
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0190694_0190785 I should be close.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191221_0191242 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191550_0191944 Although, yeah, this will, this is actually different from how we printed up here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191944_0192057 like if we're doing global search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192057_0192623 then we are going to do it like how we said before, and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192623_0192899 and then we'll either multi-select or...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192899_0193337 Choose the one we want to actually do this with. I think multi-slapped would make more sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193337_0193727 Well, it's just if there's like three of the top meetings like we said before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193727_0194086 language, looking for the lower language and get the highest rated ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194086_0194615 Actually look for the terms we're not flowing it out of all 76
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194615_0195308 So the results from that will narrow down what we're going to use for the local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195308_0195571 and we'll just do the local circumference ones that are chosen.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195571_0195821 I'm pretty preaching. Well, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195821_0196372 So it will be a bit different from how that is right now when we do the whole search at least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197254_0197407 Yes. If not, you can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197407_0197508 以上
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0201665_0201959 So that we search two different...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0202422_0202634 Let's actually fairly
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203017_0203143 Yeah, local anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203143_0203227 Well, that's easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203227_0203393 Felly, gwych chi'n meddwl?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203393_0203597 That's quite a straightforward question.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206489_0206636 Well, it kind of makes sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206636_0206734 8'ler
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206901_0207310 Are we bothering with our topic stuff still well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207310_0207511 Or is that sort of like our own topic segment?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207511_0207760 like since we can't do the labeling and all the rest.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207760_0207915 We are still doing our topic segment.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207915_0208053 Well, what's that? You are.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0208316_0209096 But we're not going to be very leased. We won't be doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they don't have labels.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209233_0209491 All the label ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209491_0209673 You're half a label too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209673_0209740 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210577_0210642 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210642_0210701 Thank you Eric.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210701_0210871 Well, no, it would be kind of straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210871_0211092 If you're quitting, it's okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218435_0218498 Probably not.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218498_0218791 I mean, just get work done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218791_0218984 I think that's what I've got to do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001099_0001453 We're not allowed to get in lights.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001887_0002029 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002237_0002381 Am I supposed to be standing up today?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002986_0003229 Yeah, good. Bye.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008190_0008382 Hello everybody.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008382_0009196 I'm Sarah, the project manager and this is our first meeting, surprisingly enough.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009196_0009474 Okay, this is our agenda.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009568_0010193 We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better, feel more comfortable with each other.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010193_0010814 Then we'll go do till training, talk about the project plan.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010814_0011589 a ddysgu'r oeddiadau i'r ddweud. A'n meddwl 25 oeddiadau i'r ddweud, fel y gallwn i'n ddweud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0011762_0012154 Now we're developing a remote control, which you probably already know.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012154_0012699 Mae'n gwybod i'r ysgol, sy'n golygu bod y byddai'r ysgol yn ysgol.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012699_0013201 because it's not out in shops. Trendy, appealing to a wide market.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0013201_0014283 ond, mae'n gweithio'n gweithio. Rwy'n gweithio'n gweithio, granys, cysylltu, rwy'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014283_0014958 Okay, first is the functional design. This is where we all go off and do our individual work.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014958_0015940 y bydd y bydd yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ymdeg yn ym
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0015940_0016094 ymddiad ymddiad.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0016231_0016780 what we're thinking, how it's going to go, and then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017038_0017203 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017203_0018410 We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard at the first. And slow up the characteristics of that animal.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0018883_0019207 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0021146_0021197 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024322_0024433 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024789_0025060 And I'm going to ask these guys to tell you that. So let's retry it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025453_0025724 ac mae'n gwneud ymddiol.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025989_0026225 a'r enw i'n cael ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0027231_0027542 No, rwy'n fwy i'n gwneud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028757_0028966 Sorry.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028966_0029010 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0035001_0035109 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0037384_0037686 Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039399_0039492 Bye guys.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039631_0039980 Good to be heard.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0042011_0042095 That's enough.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0043985_0044177 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0046109_0046216 Tentacle health.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0048966_0049134 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0050119_0050466 Right, not a seagull.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0055448_0055515 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056312_0056546 That was fun. Right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056546_0057464 Finance-wise we've got a selling price at 25 euros which I don't actually know what that is in pounds at all.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0057464_0057532 Any ideas?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058385_0058512 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058638_0058798 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0059098_0059592 I think so. I think so. I'd be able to pull it up or I could put it in the shared folder.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0060813_0060929 Ie, mae'n ddweud o'r ddweud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061351_0061782 Yeah, production costs at 12.50.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061913_0062426 half of the cellulose is taken out by building it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0062426_0062944 and profit aim is 50 million euros which is a
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0063129_0063642 Yn ymwneud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0064913_0065029 in everyone.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0065357_0066222 target group. Yes, yes. I don't think we have to, I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0066222_0066970 making that key point. Just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067520_0067829 What are your experiences with home controls?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067829_0068347 I mean, I've got, we got, we had three videos.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0068347_0069167 a TV and a sort of amp thing all set up. So we got one of the universal remote controls.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069167_0069939 a'r unig o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud, ond rydyn ni'n ddweud o'r ddweud, ond rydyn ni'n ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069939_0070270 I think it was quite cheap as well.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070270_0070483 ond yw'r ffordd yn ymgyrch.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070596_0070891 You didn't have six from your control thing, if I'm to give you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073498_0073730 Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073730_0075176 I mean, and you don't want to, I hate, I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they'll do and just sitting there searching for the tele-text button or something.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0075743_0077073 When you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions when you can do sound or options kind of recorded
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077073_0077283 things like that inside it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077283_0077979 because it doesn't make when you pick it up, it doesn't make it really complicated to look at. It's obvious what you're doing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081235_0081365 What about the older generation?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081365_0081509 my bad granny and grandkids.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081615_0082363 My granddad can answer his mobile phone, but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0082812_0083151 I don't think they teach. Yeah. My granddad thought she better be
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0084120_0084324 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0086430_0087174 I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that kind of got a windows based running system.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087295_0087683 I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the first
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087683_0088287 I've not got a new one, but my friend got a new one. That's trying to do things with it. And I just kept getting last.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0088438_0088517 That's just me.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0090577_0090750 to the next section of the screen.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091369_0091737 I bought back kind of a dual function
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091737_0092964 in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, program, things. And also, and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0092964_0093488 obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0094848_0095316 I think that's a cost thing. You don't know how much we're going to know about it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0095602_0095807 It might be small, but it might have a big size.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0097097_0097935 Rhaid, ok, mae'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweith
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0098120_0098951 I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back in days again and I get to do another fantastic part of my presentation.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102232_0102399 I would never probably.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102504_0102689 I mean the sky remote controls and everything.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102689_0103258 They're kind of moulded and look a bit different and the tail US remote controls are silver and plastic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103258_0103865 which I looks a bit smarter so yeah I guess that's stuff I think about it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103865_0104156 Okay, so let's break out there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104313_0104416 So see you in half an hour.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085279_0086194 menus on new phones now they've got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0086443_0086588 I don't know how.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0087018_0087069 Oh yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0088518_0089370 I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50 how much of an excellent screen you could get
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0089370_0089931 You'd have to keep it down to a black and white LCD.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0097068_0097179 No.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0098880_0099666 Just a quick thing about the way you're saying about the doesn't need to be fast.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0099666_0100524 So I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the we put the fashion into electronics.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0100524_0101484 So I think the whole design thing might be fine. Sure. I mean you don't. You can still have plastic in it, look quite good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0000037_0000176 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0006420_0006633 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008050_0008166 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008322_0008403 I
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0025591_0025625 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0027508_0027545 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028514_0028661 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028908_0029068 I'll call you back.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029068_0029332 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029332_0029602 Maybe it gets more than fine to me.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031347_0031914 It's actually steady. So, it's steady. It's not standing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031914_0032186 Okay, I see it as one thing, it's very supportive.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032413_0032773 It's your best friend in you. You can talk to your dog. It can be a best friend.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032773_0033136 it doesn't discriminate between you based on what you are.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0033136_0034096 Second is loyal and third is inclusion.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0034096_0035106 and sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So basically, these are the three unique features I think belong to you all. OK, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0035106_0035147 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0036433_0036784 اگر
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0050178_0050267 Right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057676_0057871 than what we might do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057871_0058150 Yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0061754_0061959 이렇게 이렇게 이렇게
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0063639_0063710 and
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0069149_0069222 the
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0070861_0071104 You want to integrate everything into one plane.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0075518_0075806 when they're
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0078708_0078774 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079289_0079360 little else.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079446_0080057 I was thinking of the same lines here instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080057_0080603 Maybe have a series display or something like that, like a mobile. With menus. With menus.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080603_0081203 And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse in Navigate.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0081521_0081896 I have a good listen.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0094604_0094666 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095091_0095738 I don't know how much we're gonna know about.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095738_0095924 but it might have its cost implications.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0104805_0104838 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000818_0000982 Is that thing?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000982_0001080 It's gray's black.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003704_0003883 I'm alright.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003883_0003972 Actually,
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0005545_0005586 Thank you.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0007420_0007886 Right, our agenda for today. Do you want us to give you a second?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008127_0008353 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008593_0008870 I'll go over what we decided last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0009263_0009912 We decide upon a universal control. One handset for all to be videoed.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0010181_0011216 that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, a wide age range, not limiting anyone.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0011216_0012023 We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, through fashion, in electronics, that kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0012023_0012947 our budget would have to try not to reflect our budget that we might.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013141_0013633 I have a bit of... Oh, oh you can see it. Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013633_0014340 dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014485_0014869 wanted to look uncluttered and daunting to look as to where.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014869_0015936 We discussed a flip-open design, reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming, things like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016324_0016680 three presentations I've got in here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016866_0017062 Shall we hear from marketing first?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017503_0017732 No, that's fine. That's fine. Okay, yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017907_0017982 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019400_0019512 M F N
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019596_0019726 function I've made.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0033828_0033873 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0052766_0053017 Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053017_0053235 Rydw i'n ddweud i'r cyfnod?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053591_0053854 Maybe we should have told you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0059477_0059630 Function at best.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0061274_0061355 No.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077551_0077886 Rwy'n meddwl i'r cyfnodd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077886_0078435 OK, felly y gallwn yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwne
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0078855_0079091 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0079260_0079339 Oh.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080268_0080336 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080959_0081103 We just didn't get it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084130_0084197 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084490_0084543 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0103869_0104058 Rhaid.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0104172_0104485 We had new project environments.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0105110_0106034 We're not going to be using teletext. Part of the consumer is considered outdated with the internet now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106240_0106856 our control is only going to be for TV, it's not going to be combined control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106856_0107844 which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us but it also makes it easier to understand.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0108057_0109180 says for TV only so looks like it's just yeah I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into but
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109419_0109550 I don't know what do you think?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109550_0109781 It's just that for TV only.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109781_0110213 I mean, general TV controls do do video as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0110444_0110888 I mean you get combined video stuff.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0112245_0112700 I think music units still got play and stop functions and programming.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0118844_0119020 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120074_0120646 We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120646_0121783 So I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing because it is something it needs to be the thing that you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0121865_0122367 used to find it needs to be something that you don't lose. So you're actually whistling.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122367_0122886 maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122886_0123385 yw'r cyfnod o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud, ac mae'n bwysig.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123385_0123711 something like that but that sounds a lot cheaper too.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123800_0124766 The third thing was that we have to make sure the copper image is very much incorporated into the handset.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0124766_0125253 So we want logo, we want...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125490_0125856 fashionable trendy I mean what you were talking about with the marketing
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125931_0126371 and people paying more for it to look good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0126492_0126781 We need to focus on that as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132038_0132750 What about you were talking about the buttons? Yeah. The controls are coming in now have kind of big
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132750_0133469 rubber buttons, not tiny little big rubber buttons, but want it by, I mean, because we've got to make it original.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133620_0133736 What about...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133869_0134201 You know with the touch screen. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0134432_0135394 So it's like a little panel that you touch for other than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either. Not sure about that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135518_0135840 Felly mae'n ddweud y gallwch yn ddweud yma.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135840_0137075 I think that might appeal, I'm thinking kind of Japan, thinking young office people, trendy.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137206_0137531 but quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137531_0138564 easily labeled so that anyone can say, oh yeah, that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0140284_0140357 those specific
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0145256_0146158 I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146158_0146540 or they can make it bigger or they can change the feature slightly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146796_0147715 It's going to be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0151286_0151974 or a speech recognition which is extremely expensive. I think that's the only way that you can provide
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0152084_0152177 that kind of issue.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0154752_0155002 We are talking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155203_0155496 the type of company that we're working for as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155496_0156520 that they want it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically associate that with the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0156520_0157418 Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0157418_0157983 but I don't think we're focusing on that. I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0158124_0158361 ymddi'r cyfnod ymddiadau cyfnod.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160471_0160942 Okay, so the remote control functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160942_0161612 We've got the TV, we've got the video, now there's
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0161750_0162392 I can't remember what it's called, a little code at the end of programme details. Video plus. Yes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0162580_0163755 We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that. I always found that really easy when I discovered it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0163884_0164486 because you've got your general record anyway so if there's a program on you want to put record on.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164486_0164979 That's fine, but if you do want to tape something in two days time, you're not sure if you're going to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164979_0165402 you put the number in and it's just a number. It's not a date, it's not time
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0165402_0165877 It's not channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just number.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166423_0166641 You've already got the numbers for tapping in anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166940_0167575 is after if you look in the newspaper or TV guide or any TV guide there's a five
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0167575_0169104 six digit number afterwards and that's number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at 10 o'clock on the 17th things like that so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169104_0169455 And it has been around for a long time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169712_0170288 No, it's not. I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0172221_0172299 Okay, so
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0179443_0180041 the functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your TV's not doing it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0180125_0180592 taking your TV and your controlling thing. Look, this is what I'm doing. It's not working. What should I do?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181366_0181542 Merci beaucoup.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181827_0181972 Instruction manuals.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181972_0182307 But I mean there's customer service.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0182307_0183125 There will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charges.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0183125_0183634 There's no extra person who has to walk to a shop on the high street.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0184469_0185430 But we should focus on making manuals user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing lots and lots of pages.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185430_0185816 It does. You just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186346_0186957 We need, I'm not sure if we need a design decision now.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0187714_0187922 Felly, mae'r ffordd ar gyfer y bwysig.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0188854_0189772 Felly, mae'n gwybod yn gweithio'r cyfnod. Felly, y gweithio'r cyfnod, mae'r cyfnod yn gweithio'r cyfnod.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0189772_0190169 you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or at night or something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190169_0190674 but it doesn't really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time once it is charged.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190674_0191003 ymlaen i'r llwyddiadau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0191820_0192107 Yeah, it could be on that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0192773_0192946 Rwy'n cael ei ddweud o'r ddechrau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193074_0193261 So the recharge will be here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193952_0194291 Yes, which is cheaper than the one that is valid.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194291_0194770 y ffordd, mae'r ffordd yn ymdweud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194770_0195498 I don't want a big box with lots of things. You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0195498_0196249 because then you have got the repetitive strain engine, no matter how much you try and make it simple.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0196609_0196676 OK, John.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0197718_0197875 Okay, so we've got a flip screen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0201381_0201563 It's kind of loaded to your head anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0202640_0203026 Can you look into the company logo?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0203150_0204079 things that are associated with the company in view to China corporate that into the design of the product.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204079_0204130 I mean
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204322_0205260 For example, if it was a sea or something like that, you could have it in a vague sea shape that opens up kind of like a shell.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0205260_0205875 something. Something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0206040_0206644 obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that's there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0208341_0208598 Well, we need to think about how it is going to look different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212165_0212769 or you could do different, like you get with mobile phones, different flashes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212769_0213100 You could have different kind of casings.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0213100_0213867 So you could have psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and...

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0218236_0219067 That was in cutting down the number, that was kind of separate, that was cutting down the number of functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0219067_0219618 making it simpler so instead of having lots of things to do in dates.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0220670_0221444 What kind of takes the place of having a button to press through the date and having the button to press through the channel things like that so
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221444_0221589 doing it could be
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221657_0222602 Yes, it could be advertisement feature rather than design feature. You know, draw attention to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0222671_0223557 and also paid lip service in the instruction manual because it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0224964_0225675 We've got the buttons, but I think we'll work through that with the design of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0226198_0226844 Ac mae'n ddweud o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227005_0227308 learning how to use it should be as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227308_0228085 there aren't going to be that many functions incorporated into it, so it should be fine. And I do instruction manual.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228085_0228384 I don't know if we deal with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228594_0228670 I think
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228984_0229266 Yeah, and different from what they're doing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0229266_0229414 Yeah, I think that's us.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230012_0230375 I think you might get guidance, but...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230550_0230564 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230717_0230976 instruction manuals because there tends to be a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0231160_0231851 demonised thing, everyone's got a big pile of them but no one really uses them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0232414_0232555 Yes, right.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233087_0233150 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233342_0233739 I think you can email me if there's any more questions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233929_0234196 and I'll be able to not answer them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0004768_0004918 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0008031_0008152 No, that's okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0017101_0017584 Is it okay if I postpone that till later? I just want to get access to a little bit more information.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0031970_0032302 Felly, rydw i'n meddwl y cwestiynau.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0034157_0034256 as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0051715_0052358 It's a very important point. It came up in our market research findings too, so I can refer to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060486_0060728 I just thought it was a good idea.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060904_0061000 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080309_0080569 Oh, I got to keep this here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080569_0080653 comes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080875_0081185 We have to, we just didn't show them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081185_0081594 Let's see if I can push it a bit more.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081740_0082067 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083136_0083235 Is that okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083679_0083990 Yn ymgyrch, dwi'n meddwl i'r ffordd.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087219_0087626 Just their general use of the remote control. You can see we had a hundred subjects there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087633_0088097 are findings lots of findings I've just come around some of them here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088097_0088814 The overall thing which I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088814_0089076 that has obvious design implications there.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0173473_0174307 Mae'r ddweud yn ymweld i'r cyfnodd yw'r cyfnodd cyfnodd. Mae'r cyfnodd cyfnodd yn cael ei wneud.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175078_0175985 Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175985_0176511 Felly, ydych chi'n gwybod i'r ffordd o'r holl gwylltio. Felly, ydych chi'n gwybod i'r ffordd o'r holl gwylltio.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180828_0181323 But I mean, if there were any more, or if we're absolutely deaf in it, it's only going to be for TV and video.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022501_0022885 What the first thing question asked is what we trying to design?

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023844_0024692 everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliances sending the signal to you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0024903_0025738 And so I decided I'd have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0025738_0026006 Ond oeddwn ni wedi bod yn dweud yn dweud...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0026148_0027208 ideas from other people, we want to make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that, well it wasn't really my area because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027266_0027489 I'm dealing with the inside really.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033253_0033769 they have to be obviously this size to fit those batteries in.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040149_0040724 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud yn ymddi, mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud yn ymddi.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040724_0041786 and then I just had a quick look at the examiled sign but I left that mostly to the interface designer.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0041918_0042276 And so this is what I have as the base guide for what we want to do.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042276_0042828 It's not a proper circuit. I'm not sure if it will work or not.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042828_0043307 I'm not even confident that that's the real way you'd wire it up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0043307_0044180 So I've just got the power going to the infrared bulb, the chip and the UI interface.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044335_0044440 which would basically
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044440_0045351 Felly, ydych chi'n meddwl, y cyfnodd yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol, ac yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045351_0045881 which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045992_0047240 I have a form of communication that the TVs are already using and since that's another reason to use infrared because that's what all TVs use at the moment.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047240_0047388 And then finally...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047388_0048772 We want it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost, so all the components that I've put forward are at a low cost, so that should be good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0048772_0049534 Mae'r bwysig yn ymdweud yn ymdweud o'r product bwysig yn ymdweud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049534_0049953 we were talking about it before, and also just something that I was thinking about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049953_0051225 Because they're small, they're also easy to lose. So if we could look into some way of, I don't know, some anti going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051225_0051707 Mae'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yma.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051707_0051903 That's a very important point. It came up in a very...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0052171_0052865 Alright, okay. And yeah, that's what I came up with there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0059548_0059679 Ffansioneth.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0060745_0061098 My pleasure.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0116764_0116844 We'll
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0117659_0117763 more of the speech right now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0118863_0120080 But on that again I just thought because you can get those key chains down and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is. So I thought that could be cool.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0130630_0131204 Like, yeah, you could have a number of different designs. I mean, inside they'd be essentially exactly the same.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0131327_0131716 If we just could be same in the body, but look spectrally good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0134069_0134462 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0135290_0135625 Don't have to press it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138496_0138917 Ond oes yn oed, oes yn oed yn ymdweud y ddweud y ddweud ymdweud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138917_0140603 economics. There's physically different things. If you've ever seen the Xbox, they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically too big.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0140693_0142376 They're cut just generally, Japanese people have smaller hands, so they can go under the controller, which is... So if you... I don't know what, because obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something, and smaller ones for others.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0150192_0151305 I was just thinking about how you could combat that because without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the challenge.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0151424_0151723 which is extremely expensive.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0154022_0154151 तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165687_0165894 Anything like that is just number.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0169347_0169912 It's been around for a long time. It's just it's not very well advertised. No it's not.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0170330_0171457 If you've built something like Sky anyway, you can just press the button on the program once and it will record that program when it's on and you press it twice and it will record the whole series.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171608_0171863 So, yeah.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0184229_0184510 Mae'r ddweud yn ddweud yn ymgyrch.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0185403_0185487 It does.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0190909_0191734 Yeah, and if you had one of those, just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting up the blueprint.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0191928_0192056 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0192552_0192970 Mae'r ddechrau yn y ddechrau.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0193338_0193963 Yn ymwneud, mae'n gweithio.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0053624_0053899 Maybe we should actually do it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059104_0059321 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059321_0059379 I see.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060255_0060416 Mm-hmm.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060673_0060814 That's good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0061620_0062515 Actually some of my points might overlap with what William just mentioned but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0062515_0063547 this took a valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think will take a feedback from the marketing because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0063691_0064255 I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064255_0064919 So purpose as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make it as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064919_0065298 I have to summarize I would say it should be user friendly by being easy to use.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0065404_0066192 rather than having a lot of complex versions because you can have an engineering driven maybe having 100 buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066315_0066622 like volume control or channel changing the channel over the
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066741_0067462 But we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it. We'll punch in these two features together.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067462_0067737 So what the concept is to have a flip top model.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067737_0069035 The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to say program their favorite channels or whatever.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069035_0069351 10 pcs middle part of the flip top
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069351_0070654 So it's like it could be accessed by a wider range of audience and we can punch in new features such as added features such as shop proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0070826_0072814 Findings most people prefer user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote controller for say a year or something and they have not used maybe 30 to 40% of the buttons. So it's not of no use of punching in those trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse a user.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0072814_0073649 As we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economist for higher production like 50 million research.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0073649_0074378 With that I think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also. So we can add more features and make it less cost free.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0074762_0075212 that's so this is if you ask me personally I would make a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0075447_0076762 We should look at the buttons, whether they are soft or little hard because sometimes the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0076762_0076903 Bueno, lo simple.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077084_0077176 user friendly design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077302_0077469 Any comments?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080345_0080468 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080544_0080661 You can't.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080727_0080950 You'll have to discount the point.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081300_0081424 Let me push it a bit more.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0103476_0103651 Is that okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0112627_0113386 programming. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want to combine something like that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0114090_0114129 and present.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0130021_0130539 So are we talking of a single model or maybe 5, 6 designs?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0131349_0131665 The features could be same in the body but looks better.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0142436_0143060 Maybe to as it was indicated the risk of repeated use.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143060_0143427 the injuries maybe your touchscreen could be a better option for that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143672_0144196 So you are dividing designs based on not only segment,
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144196_0144633 your desire dividing it according to the countries also the market.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144633_0145286 maybe for us and you can have a slightly bigger remote and maybe in Japan and you need to have small

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0183560_0184036 I think I will need too much of an effort for a phone where he might drop down the street.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0184036_0184327 but for a remote, he will just report to the binary.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0192253_0192616 Are we talking about the concept of rechargeable something?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198282_0198846 What I was thinking of design which Nokia came up with almost 607 years back.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198846_0199279 Basically, we have a flat one. It looks like a box, like a chocolate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199279_0199946 that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they can move with something like this covered up so here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199946_0200218 and you don't have to, you don't bend your thumb too much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200218_0200588 So it's like a, you can say a banana chip kind of thing curved up at the boat.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200744_0201169 So what happens is you don't have to press your thumb to double click
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201249_0201901 So it's already curved up so you can move it to your hands anyway. So we can have a like you know mold it according to your
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201997_0202359 the way you hold off its kind of semicircular in the bottom.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0202482_0202746 I want to see exactly something so it will be open.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0206728_0206856 We could look into that part.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207096_0207273 What we are talking is to make it more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207410_0207989 rather than like C-Share's logo could become, you could put a logo in the corner of the model
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207989_0208367 rather than you know trying to make it like a sea shallow water you can
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0209025_0209098 No.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0211055_0211171 Yeah, we could have done it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215455_0215628 Maybe we could commit some safe fight.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215628_0216163 designs and then choose whichever appeals the most like that would be the most common design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0216283_0216461 we can think of vice-extrusions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0226542_0226773 for being lost.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0229030_0229156 And definitely from what
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232357_0232411 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232559_0232680 Okay, time for us to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232928_0232967 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0000002_0000202 I'll wait till you're on your own.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0005239_0005447 You
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008008_0008387 Welcome back everybody. Love you had fun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008544_0009352 Right, and this is our conceptual design meeting. I think we're starting ahead of ourselves.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0009477_0009969 from the last meeting. Yeah, I think, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0010104_0011160 This is where we talk about properties, materials, user interface and trend watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011269_0011501 Felly, rydyn ni'n ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011664_0011891 to do that already, but we'll just go over it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012298_0012602 The minutes from last time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012602_0013372 We had a couple of changes in our plans in that community is teletext.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0013372_0014280 it wasn't going to be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0014472_0016044 We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition. We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016044_0016539 We were thinking a show, but something along those lines, just a different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016897_0017210 you are going to look into the rechargeable batteries.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017331_0017939 And we're gonna think about the port and alarm for getting it lost and things like that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017939_0018862 and our market was going to be young business kind of range.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0018862_0019193 Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0019193_0019284 Yes, if you feel.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0024946_0025060 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0035729_0035965 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036149_0036391 Let's start from the inside and work our way out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036755_0036949 Yeah, take some.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0037104_0037309 Yes. Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0038856_0038972 I hate those little things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0039096_0039596 Especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0049745_0049886 i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w ddweud ymlaen i'w d
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050012_0050260 This is the wind-up radio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050494_0050799 Llywodraeth, mae'n gwybod yn ymddangos i'r ddweud?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050799_0051223 Felly, rydyn ni'n gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod i'r gwybod
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053146_0053294 when you got to your
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053378_0053790 That is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053961_0054086 Any.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0055701_0055969 I'm pretty sure the cellar is from the sand.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056054_0056835 I don't think it counts electric lights now. But I mean, not many, you don't want to limit your market.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056835_0057300 I mean people who live in basement flats, there's not that many people. But there are people.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058059_0058272 But then it would be charging to the dead
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058272_0058872 I think the point is they charge you through the day and then you've got it charged.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0059540_0059632 Yes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064002_0064729 But then if you think about watch it's on your wrist, so it's on your whole body, it's on your body the whole time. Yeah. So you're walking around.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064729_0065014 you're doing things it is moving a lot of time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065014_0065289 If you switch the TV on then you put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065289_0065588 then you pick it out to change it and then you put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065588_0065718 Then again.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0068177_0068398 that's not the draw on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0069823_0069960 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071616_0071774 expensive as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071774_0072311 expensive
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0074029_0074161 the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075002_0075156 I think, yeah, correct.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075916_0076308 Mae'r ddweud yn ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080189_0080629 Okay, can we add in an attachment to closing feature?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080799_0080978 Can we think about that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080978_0081433 Cysyllt ymwneud y cenedlau.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0081629_0081912 Mae'r ddweud yn ddim yn ymddi'r ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082370_0082509 Where am I?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082509_0084553 If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape, then the kinetic is something people don't do. We're doing something original and different. But if you wore it, if it's something you could just clip in your pocket, then you would have that less
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084553_0084817 you wouldn't lose it so much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084951_0085271 But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0085412_0085659 the eternal battle for control of the government.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0087163_0087235 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091816_0091988 What kind of things do we have to consider today?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091988_0092807 Can we, what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size? Well, we would have to fit the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0111147_0111276 Felly, mae'r ffordd yn ffordd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117621 Felly, yn ddiddordeb y ffasiaeth yn ymgyrch, mae'r ffasiaeth yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0117621_0118084 Like those pens that you get with a grip that you can pull down.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0118872_0119263 Ac mae'n gwybod yn fwy o'r bwysig o'r bwysig, ond rydyn ni'n gwybod yn fwy o'r bwysig.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0129140_0129293 Oh, he was fatal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131235_0131449 I think it would be good to have a contrast between
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131449_0132237 If the whole thing is going to be this rubber thing, it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0132237_0132764 Now how would you distinguish if you had a bear? How would you distinguish where you had to press?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0134328_0134463 this thing could fall out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0135045_0135233 i'n ddweud yw'r llos.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137437_0137923 Okay, we'll talk about that. So, she's finished here. Yeah, that. Come back to that. Yeah, that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137923_0138131 That's the end of the video.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144155_0144495 We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144866_0144989 Well, it's a real good choice.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144989_0145772 you're sick watching TV yeah are you gonna want to open it and say oh shit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0145952_0146152 Ja, og så er det jo også der, at der ikke er klart en eller anden.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0148283_0148597 Very quick, Fuzzy.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0155824_0155938 अगरापिक पीड़ा
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0160946_0161428 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'r rhan o'r pwysig o'r timur ar y bwrdd.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161564_0161743 if you think you have holding it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161877_0162283 You would be using your thumbs to price? Just like a mobile phone?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0163533_0164442 that's what I was just saying. And then have the Elsie get the top and then be able to touch that for the other trans.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0164442_0165203 So it has the volume and the program, things like that. And the load is on the lower. No, thanks. Perfect.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0175745_0176007 Felly rydyn ni'n gwybod i'r llai yn ystafell.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0176145_0176343 Is that the volume? Yeah, I'll blow it in my channel.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0179203_0179843 I'm not sure how long I've got left, but we need to make a decision about
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180107_0180200 the things we've discussed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180270_0180650 So we agree.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180781_0180899 Do we agree on the battery?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181306_0181831 That means that there's no function for the port.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181831_0182425 you know that it sits in the pressing button and having so we could incorporate voice recognition yeah I think I mean
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182425_0182687 It's like a gadget.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182807_0182892 at a certain point.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0184800_0184921 I think the only...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185031_0185833 I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost. That means we have to cut down somewhere else.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185833_0186520 Ond yn fwy o'r ffordd, mae'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0186520_0186655 and our city's not cheap.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0187652_0187765 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0188079_0188197 That would be good.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0189165_0189312 Do you want, like, a backup?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191274_0191588 Okay, so I've got battery.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191588_0192062 the inside components is pretty standardised across the board, isn't it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192189_0192592 So there's not really a decision to be made there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192808_0193128 the buttons. What did you give us, Erzo?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0193474_0193716 the bareboard LCD
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0194471_0194948 On the top point, okay, you've got the touch. Okay. And then...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0195625_0195847 Okay. Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0197336_0197415 Yes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0198156_0198256 for the inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0199200_0199392 O, dwi'n ddweud yna.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0200704_0201858 No, I think we don't want to be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway. The material that we would be using would be cheap.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0201858_0202008 So we could make it red.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202008_0202770 We could make it psychedelic. We could make it black and white, zebra stripes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202770_0203384 But that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the theme.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0203384_0203662 So you could just pick anything.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0205521_0206423 That's just different. It's different. It's just different from everything else. I mean, I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0206423_0207105 sort of beige and blabber. Do you either want something that goes with that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207105_0207294 which is what's on the market anyway.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207294_0208360 or you want something that contrasts as, you know, like, you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock. Because they're so interesting.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0215226_0215710 OK, I've got five minutes. That might have been up for a while.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0223557_0224476 Well they do but I think we can... Is it the one that's kind on the market? Well it is, it is. I think you just address that with advertising.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0224476_0225035 you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225035_0225419 obviously it will have a little go on it just like everything but everything else has a little go on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225419_0226057 the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does without that so I'm not worried about that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0226877_0227640 depending on how I know depending on the expense of it. I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company is looking into so
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0227763_0228698 that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's huge expensive we'd have to cut that somewhere else and it's worth thinking about.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0228698_0229151 But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229151_0229325 Right, I'm going to wrap it up then.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229632_0230258 Ac o'r angen i'r gwneud yma!
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0230519_0231255 So I think we've probably got, it says closing, we have 40 minutes. So I think we've probably got about that time before we come back.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045596_0046596 This is the chip called the TA-11835 which is what's used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0046596_0047486 based on your input and it's pretty much useful all TV remotes at the moment.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047986_0048454 there's actually no rechargeable option available.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055103_0055725 Yeah, it would. The dynamo would take more space because you'd actually need a physical self-handle to wind up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055977_0056085 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0057514_0058039 Mae'r bwysig yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062874_0064041 and that would last for... well I don't... I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0064990_0065140 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0065538_0066039 Yeah, but then again, I think it is because if you think about it then watch

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067624_0068678 you're only using it for an incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it. So it's not the draw on it? No, no, I don't think the draw would be.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0071725_0071915 Mae'r ddweud yn fawr.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0072299_0073132 yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones but the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073243_0073799 I think they're not very resistant to dropping.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073799_0074827 Because if you drop stuff, the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big. But, I mean, if... ...remotes always get thrown around and stuff.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0074990_0075189 I think, yeah, frankly.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0075365_0076057 I mean, you calculate as you don't really throw around a lot. Whereas remotes, you do, they tend to...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0076239_0076697 Yn ymwneud, mae'r ddweud yn y ddweud, ond mae'r ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddweud yn y ddwe
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077618_0077833 control link.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077962_0078479 Yeah, if you had something using the standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078600_0078967 ar gyfer y bach o'r ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078967_0079783 Felly, rydyn ni'n ddweud yw'r ysgol yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddwe
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0079932_0080195 Yeah, I think it would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087220_0087329 Let's get well and move on.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087485_0088899 My second part of my findings, the most current remote to use this silicon PCB board which prints circuit board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0088899_0089550 which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0089550_0091768 it'll connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this LED in a sequence of on and off bursts
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0092714_0093013 The thing about it is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0093157_0094354 Mae'r ddweud yn ymdill o'r cyfnodd yn ymdill, ond mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill, mae'n ddweud yn ymdill,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094354_0094603 Felly mae'r cyfnod ymlaen y traxer.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094603_0095211 you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0095211_0096216 if you wanted to. But there is an option to do it like that, or you could have some sort
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096359_0096753 arrays switches which I'll speak about in the next bit.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096908_0097666 and then to, yeah, so to conserve battery life, the remote should be in a standby mode while not being used.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0097666_0098463 Now what I was thinking about that was because sometimes when you have these things, you've got little lights on behind the buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0098463_0099218 so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone you do it more often than on a TV remote
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099218_0099999 but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like 5 or 10 seconds or not being used I'd have that turned off.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099999_0100304 ydych chi'n gwybod i'r ddweud y cwm yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0100491_0101417 The case material I've been sent what the factory can actually give us.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0101417_0102327 There's the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway, has the main case housing and
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0102459_0103250 the main problems with the way you could go forward, but I think it would be a bit impractical.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0103250_0104324 titanium very expensive just the process which to make it is expensive and rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0104324_0105188 Well you're saying that people like this spongy feel, so perhaps something made of rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105188_0105650 but I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105785_0106024 They're per cross.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106153_0106991 are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106991_0107867 I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0107867_0108482 ac y problemau ar y casig yn ymdweud yw'r
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0108608_0109417 quite there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109417_0109818 If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109818_0110496 Whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more... they can do sort of curve shapes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0110496_0110920 but whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0111136_0111242 Yn ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ymwneud ym
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112321_0112383 Yeah, I-
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112823_0113240 Yeah, in titanium I don't think it would be available at all really.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113240_0113765 that just it work well you could make it available in the titanium
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113765_0114170 it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0114170_0115100 because of the expense of how much titanium is light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115243_0115311 Sure am I.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115672_0115851 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116388_0116511 rubber. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116863_0117008 as you can peel them off.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0119373_0120482 Also, just going back to the interface designs with the buttons, we were planning to do some sort of touch screen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0120482_0121957 Now what I was saying before about, instead of having, you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and say just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122071_0122465 oedd ydych chi'n gwybod i'r llwyth. Mae'r opon yw'r un.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122465_0122835 y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddwe
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122835_0123831 but I thought that an LCD type of screen, because one, they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0123831_0124958 Two, you can have them in a sort of a ring. You could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of sat thing. You could have them like a touch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125432_0125558 I will
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125910_0127015 Oh, on the LCD screen, you could fit it. The problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curved things with it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127015_0127827 but you wouldn't have with the LCD you'd have the wires coming off you wouldn't have that with the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127940_0128210 with the LCD you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0128504_0128659 Awesome is it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129264_0129906 You could have a flat screen inside. Yeah. But I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129906_0130571 It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white. But there'd be touch, touch buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0130571_0131188 felly mae'n ddweud yn ddweud. Mae'n ddweud o'r busn yn brub, ac mae'n ddweud o'r material, mae'n ddweud o'r song anti-r.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0131618_0131678 Bro.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0132839_0133139 Yeah, I hadn't really thought that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134130_0134192 de
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134192_0135048 Rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystod, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy'n cael ei wneud yn ystyried, ond rwy
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0136768_0136855 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0137738_0138096 Yeah, that's the end of the video.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0138991_0139069 I
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139363_0139573 Yeah, yeah, that would be fairly simple.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139573_0140740 I mean you'd actually have two separate circuit boards where they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0140740_0141112 because in the actual flip that you'd have some linking.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0146938_0147093 I mean you can't, you could do it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147093_0147921 you could have a... because if you just put the full charge through an LCD display or completely blank it out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147921_0148233 I know she could get any mirror effect on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0156418_0156912 Yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen and this LCD screen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0163508_0163805 That's what I was just saying.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0174354_0174537 Well, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182295_0182473 Yeah, I think it's a...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182707_0183573 Yeah it is quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got these parts already in stock.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0183573_0184148 then it won't be cheap to remanivate. It will be cheap, so to remanivate.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184148_0184662 So do you reckon that's a good idea about where's the remote I'm hearthing?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184662_0184793 Felly mae'r ffordd yn fawr yn fawr.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0186500_0187432 Yeah, I see, it is not cheap. Well, it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour, because if it just got black and white one.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0187432_0187668 And they use them in character like this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189054_0189228 What you should do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189926_0190502 Nid y cenedig yn ychydig yn ymddangos y fawr, y bantryd yn y fawr.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0190615_0190857 Felly mae'n ddweud yn ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0193636_0194134 I think we're going for the LCD on the buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0194134_0194770 Yn y top. Yn y top, rwy'n meddwl.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0195004_0195515 On the bottom we're going to have the rubber ones, the anti-RSR ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0196178_0197020 Mae'r fflipscreen, y top yma yn y LCD, ac y bottom yma yn y rhaid i'r rhaid.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0198019_0198162 Prasta.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0200605_0200649 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0212137_0212251 You could just go...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0214132_0215132 Yeah, yeah, with these rubber, these rubberized, okay, not the actual plastic outside, it's just the rubber.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0220154_0220323 Oh yeah, yeah, I wish it was.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0226986_0227165 Yeah, it's depending on the expense of it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0227609_0227779 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'r stwch sy'n ddweud.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0229935_0229994 Goed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0008247_0008327 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0036430_0036499 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054083_0054598 regarding the sizes which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration size also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054598_0055216 So maybe it's standard triple in my tech less space and dynamo might take more space.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0060854_0061353 What is the life of the kinetic battery? It runs for a long time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0064027_0064066 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0071528_0071765 Mae'r ddweud yn ymddiad.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0072058_0072205 I presume that's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076724_0076992 And the question is like...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076992_0077461 Which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be like charging like a mobile for every day
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0077596_0077934 remote control link. So, let's look at the light.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111124_0111763 So the glitch line. Yeah, and second question is like mobile you can change the cover. Yeah, cover the skin or whatever.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111763_0112363 So in this case if you are looking at like the customer can change the color like from green, bright green to chili red or something like that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0112363_0112923 Is that feature available in Titanium or is it only specific to plastic?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117608_0117718 Like those pens.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117973_0118068 That could be a problem.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0118192_0118395 It would be comfortable to hold on.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125060_0125310 So I guess we're going to the last part.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125566_0125997 just what you said adding a bit of meaning a bit complicated yes like
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0134989_0135328 It was working.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0135328_0136485 a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often, we will find it very irritating to use, you know, and he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button like.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0136485_0136741 if you keep punching with a point over over
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138042_0138503 There's one small question before like you're listening regarding the circuit since we are having a flip top
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138503_0139147 Customize the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top. Oh, yeah, complex button in this thing
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0139147_0139304 So, we can divide the circuit like this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148592_0148738 Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148998_0149237 I will show you something which I did here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149237_0149677 First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149677_0150290 especially for the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150290_0150802 Second is we check into competitors. The picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150802_0151570 So you generally see there's not much of variety and marketing teams said people need trendy, they're both of black and white.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0151570_0152116 So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152292_0152729 And second thing is there's too much of confusion here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152729_0152905 no particular remote is standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153118_0153286 like some some people have
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153441_0153591 He'll you see this?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153591_0153741 This is on uh
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153858_0154292 I found that the only common feature is the channel control and volume control.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154292_0154798 rest other buttons they are now very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models and all.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154928_0155214 Okay, and second as already discussed with William.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0155214_0156212 We are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the middle of the flip top and graphic user interface, basically which is what we do in computer.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156212_0156505 have icons or touchpad over top.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156891_0157538 like you have on your icons or something, you have is a good example of a GUI traffic user in your choice.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0157634_0157921 So basically a person need not point or click on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158012_0158431 press any particular device, it just has to click on that particular icon.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158431_0159281 and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means user button.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159281_0159776 So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent circle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159878_0160312 So we are having a combination of both. So on the simpler board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0160312_0160780 on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164344_0164499 the K-transn into the half
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164949_0165076 and the little dicks on the lower
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165076_0165165 No, thanks.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165562_0165774 So the findings are too many clitorid buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165863_0166384 the repetition of certain patterns which I already explained.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166384_0166613 all are confusing and inconsistent.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166613_0166912 Okay, we had a latest finding of voice recognition that was available
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167049_0167557 which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167557_0168273 We have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0168273_0169125 But for like we had a response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169125_0169527 So it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers I am here. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169527_0170446 some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170446_0170664 and technologically innovative also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170898_0171243 So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0171623_0172153 My personal preferences would be like as already I did with marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172153_0172555 they want something to do with fruit. So I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172555_0173179 But yeah, we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors or red chili. Yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0173301_0174236 tomato right over and second thing is certain standard buttons we should have. For example, if you see the previous slide,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0174609_0175151 I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0175151_0175720 So we will not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176016_0176429 This is a central one. The one. Oh, is that volume? Yeah, volume and channel.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176429_0177106 So keep that standardize because that's the most common feature across all models. If you look at all the models, it's here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0178082_0178157 voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0181014_0181081 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0187746_0187925 maybe we could start with the black and white
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0188073_0188307 That would be good. Yeah. Upgrade later on up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197144_0197260 and for the students.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197709_0198266 For the body design I think plastic.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0198266_0198782 for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0199172_0199264 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0205544_0205727 It's just different.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0212288_0212491 So, it's a privilege.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213084_0213742 and finally the body should be detachable maybe you can change the body or the case casing the case of the body
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213742_0214102 It should be molded with the design in such a way you can change it overnight.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0214919_0214966 até a próxima.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0218025_0218991 We are talking of voice recognition also because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate remote control if it's lost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219083_0219306 So are you looking at the voice to suggest she goes?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219578_0219981 or maybe like a value message string and last thing some devices you put on keychains
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220136_0220425 Oh yeah, yeah, the whistle runs. The whistle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220425_0220813 So we can financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0222260_0222540 So I mentioned repeatedly incorporating in the design.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0230257_0230355 I get a question now.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0232171_0232396 I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0000368_0000686 If you leave them on, you'll get to look like a noodle the whole time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0001995_0002074 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002393_0002526 and sweet and kind of nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002738_0002856 Okay, I switched on.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003272_0003390 You were good to go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003390_0003552 OK.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003664_0003952 Mynd i'n ddweud ychydig i'r charger cenedig.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004093_0004564 ddodol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004709_0004997 It's going to be a problem factor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004997_0005194 We wanted a standby function.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005194_0005672 The case interiors can be soft, rubbery, changeable.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005672_0006122 buttons for the combination of LCD and rubber according to the design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006122_0006812 ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn ymddiw'r ddweud yn
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006812_0007631 and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0007631_0008203 and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0008858_0009029 prototype presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0009260_0009381 I think that would be you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010325_0010586 Dwi'n rhaid i'n ddweud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010901_0010995 Yes, yes, you can.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010995_0011086 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012537_0012988 Just take it off.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012988_0013135 안녕
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0014172_0014215 forward.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0020953_0021050 and the puns and the puns.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0021493_0021601 All right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0023326_0023877 So put it in the top section rather than the bottom section because it's the top.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027237_0027350 und
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027464_0027593 I like it too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0032909_0032972 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033289_0033662 Actually, no, it would be your type of picture. Yeah, your front, your front side of that, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033662_0033840 Oh right, yeah okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033980_0034152 So when you've actually got it open it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0034235_0034335 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0039904_0040303 but not interfering with the website and the product.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041343_0041510 Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041653_0041912 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041912_0042199 I've now got evaluation criteria.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0042707_0043170 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0045226_0045415 It's quite similar to what it was before though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0058297_0058533 Just right, Marlene.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0060141_0060204 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0063692_0063765 I would agree.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0064951_0065004 as it is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0069602_0069659 too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0072117_0072286 It's just 2.5 for that one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0075853_0076076 I would say too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0076076_0076158 That's it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077244_0077443 One point has really just fired.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077443_0077562 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0087136_0087889 Well the type of button that we're going to use in the bottom half, the material, minimizes aerosides, meant to.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088191_0088855 Maybe because it's slightly, with the size that we've got, it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it, isn't that much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088855_0089231 So maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089313_0089572 Okay, accurately the buttons in between.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089572_0089900 It's quite obvious, just big buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0095822_0095902 and stand to a stand.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096148_0096209 It would be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096383_0096845 And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you realize it wasn't in that room. You go into that room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102140_0102218 I don't think so.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102431_0102558 I should have been here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102558_0102627 I take the side.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0103784_0104040 too much. Apart from having a huge big
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105024_0105081 Do you think so?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105433_0105566 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106383_0106722 Okay, I've got finance here now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106722_0107058 I'm going to plug this in so you can all see it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111261_0111373 Nid yw'r amser.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111556_0111672 that screamer goodnight.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111791_0111963 that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0112668_0113201 We just type numbers into this and we come out of the final bay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113201_0113484 So I was still on for kinetic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113715_0113995 See, it would have been handy to have this at the beginning.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113995_0114217 It might be a good choice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0114509_0114789 Right, what's happening with the electronics?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0115794_0115886 moment
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117120 Oh, right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117520_0117628 so it would be two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117973_0118028 One, two, three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119130_0119210 one depth of care.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119730_0119868 of what's a single care.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0120288_0120438 So just one job of...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0121644_0122034 We've got plastic and rubber
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0123290_0123329 She's like,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0124483_0124648 It would be like saying we're using...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125074_0125261 See, it says case material.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125385_0125843 So we're not actually using plastic in a case? No, no, that's it's a
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125843_0126008 It's including. It's including.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0127840_0128124 Okay, we'll just put it in his, we'll put it in his half.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128357_0128636 We should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128938_0129220 We don't stuff anyone's toes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129220_0129394 Okay, special color. Do we need that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129643_0129734 to the British.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138235_0138315 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138315_0138673 Oh no, it's 7.5. It's changed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0139863_0140057 That's not calculated.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140280_0140355 Okay, there we go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140434_0140639 E'n moyn!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0141642_0141956 We haven't been dealing with dollars though, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142112_0142400 Okay so the highest we've got is the electronics here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142723_0142945 If we...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146296_0146349 Where's the...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146444_0146567 Where's the voice recognition?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146864_0146956 Right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147212_0147361 Well the connect is three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147361_0147641 If we change it to the battery, it's minus three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148023_0148079 All right.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148079_0148241 Keep seeing zooms.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148868_0149309 We can do it some other way. We can do it. It doesn't have to be voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0149309_0150037 We could do the voice recognition for business class or something, like an upgraded version.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0150037_0150218 You could choose to have them.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0151326_0151659 So she would just change her eyes?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154493_0154605 Okay, we can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154748_0155625 make the price fit and then say if we had our purchase we would have had this because it also sets it apart because we've done all the background work
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0155625_0156026 They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156026_0156347 It's some completely different associated with your company.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156347_0156467 Right, okay, so...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157505_0157721 Was it 12.5?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157721_0157907 No, it's 12.25.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158190_0158482 Yeah, well, two, 12.25 times two is...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158669_0158815 25. Are they going to?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0160463_0160841 The gender one was where the price was, wasn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162262_0162338 12.5
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162645_0162720 That's how people
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163089_0163418 So, is that got us covered for the electronics then?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163418_0163680 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n gwybod i'n
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0165733_0165921 Right, done that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166372_0166561 perfect evaluation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166692_0166948 We've done Room for Creativity, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166948_0167513 because we've got decisions that we would have made that we won't, didn't feel able to make.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0167748_0167997 I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168536_0168736 in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168915_0169188 Did you feel like a team?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0169188_0169806 or did you feel like? I would say it was a team. I think it was a team.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173184_0173296 여기
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173296_0173446 How did you find it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0176832_0177869 I like the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that there wasn't the best idea but no one felt like shop planning.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0177869_0178399 you know, it didn't matter saying what you thought because if it wasn't something that was that relevant
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178399_0178669 and it didn't matter because it was just another idea in the end.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178669_0178828 that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179060_0179486 Well, you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179596_0180250 I'm still not caught up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0180250_0180551 That's nothing to do with the teamwork.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181444_0181597 That was quite fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181597_0182055 ym mhwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwysg, ymwys
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0182055_0182133 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0183562_0183667 had time to kind of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184151_0184614 Yeah, because we could just sort of say, sorry, what did you say about that? Or what do you think about that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184614_0184842 rather than having to email you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184842_0184984 but it was nice having it there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0185103_0185350 like the whole picture of the same.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0189996_0190296 Yeah, I think it's new to this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191575_0191709 And, uh, yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191709_0191888 Well, they have to come from somewhere.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192020_0192299 And as she... as what? Sorry. Good. Sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192299_0193197 As was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, no one thought about it particularly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193197_0193678 I mean, they're slightly different, so someone's been shouting in the room and said, Maycar is a bit different from everyone else's.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193678_0194216 because there's something we should think about but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196176_0196984 But then when everything is really smart, and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196984_0197713 I mean, if you could have something that's proper, funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0197713_0198494 I mean they could even go into, you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0198494_0199206 You'd pay a lot extra because it's individually being plastic with being made for you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199206_0199556 but people could have anything that they wanted.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199712_0199792 president
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0203973_0204308 Well, it's innovation for money's sake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204308_0204544 that people have to keep forcing it onto people.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204806_0205290 and you can get, you've got your hands at the works fine but you can't get battery anymore for that type of phone.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205290_0205582 Mae'r ddweud yn ychwaneg.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205778_0205904 That's my niece.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206223_0206361 In closing...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206460_0206619 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206619_0207514 and our costs are below budget with recommendations that the budget be increased but I think I don't know what do you think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0207514_0207752 Dwi'n credu bod yna'r ddysgu'r cyfnodd.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208156_0208471 like us being well paid kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208471_0208983 and the heating for the building to think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209312_0209994 So it looks, well it looks like it's gonna be 50% profit. You've still got all of the overheads to come out of that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209994_0210623 So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price of the egg. So that maybe
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0210623_0210881 I think, but you were saying that that's quite...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213317_0213646 to shame it will never get me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213646_0213744 maybe I can
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213744_0213984 See you next time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214271_0214736 The project has been evaluated well and truly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214736_0215214 Yn ymwneud yw'r ysgolwch yn ymwneud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215214_0215890 So we've got about 50 minutes to catch up to everything that I fell behind with.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215890_0216450 So I'll be delegating it. I am the Robolize Project Supervising. So good luck.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0216954_0217203 I think the celebration is the 25 pounds.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0217288_0217464 I know I will be dancing on the dance.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0218479_0218677 And the air just lasts, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219181_0219500 I think I've got minutes for two of the meetings and...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219619_0219703 Last thingy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0222167_0222225 I just got
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0001511_0001599 Awesome.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0212398_0213152 Mae'r ddweud yn fwy o'r ddweud yn ymweld i'r ddweud. Mae'n ddweud yn ystod yn ymddiadol. Ond mae'n ddweud yn ymddiadol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213477_0213648 Mmm.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213648_0213692 video.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213692_0214036 Do you have an idea of what's going on?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0219792_0219958 Stay in tune.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0220084_0220492 Felly, mae'n ddweud i'r ddweud i chi o'r ffordd yma.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221077_0221151 I'm really...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221151_0221379 Ond ydych chi'n meddwl i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009137_0009262 And that's for us.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009949_0010093 Yeah, shall I show?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010093_0010200 まさか
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010200_0010830 Dwi'n gwybod, dwi'n gwybod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010830_0010982 Can I just make you? Yes, yes you can.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0011655_0011774 I'm just gonna try something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0012076_0012140 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0013863_0014453 Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, our final presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0014453_0015093 and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015277_0015894 It's going to have a plastic body with a sort of standard color.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015894_0016555 we're thinking something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0016555_0017582 this is underneath the rubberised outer casing which there'd be a wide choice they would be attached.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017582_0017838 ond yw'n cael ei wneud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017838_0018731 the wide choice of colours and patterns. So you've got a lot of customisation with it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0018731_0020259 It's obviously a sort of clamshell design and the top LCD screen you can see there would be sort of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020371_0020670 The black and white touchscreen? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020670_0021549 yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymddi'r bod yn ymd
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021549_0021771 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021771_0022666 and working on the inside with already said decided on the kinetic batteries which actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0022666_0023422 thinking about it now because you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get it in top.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0023993_0024362 Mae'n dweud y cyfnod o'r system rhaid o'r rhaid.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024362_0024997 Mae'r ddweud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwne
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024997_0025272 So we presume that they'd also be quite cheap.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025272_0025780 So you have something like where you chat out where is the remote and
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025911_0026127 It'll shout back, I'm here for something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026345_0026723 I'm saying yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026723_0026955 It wouldn't shout out on here or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026955_0027532 It was just a chat on here. Or something too similar.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0027532_0028157 Yeah, if it was getting there. Well, that could be something the next time, maybe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028157_0028476 You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028476_0029174 y traddwl yw'r traddwl yw'r TV yw'r traddwl yw'r traddwl yw'r trofyn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029174_0029767 It would have, obviously, because it's split over two different layers.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029767_0030462 would need two separate PCBs that will be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0030462_0031657 and because obviously all TVs use this the same infrared medium we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031657_0031836 and the infrared
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031988_0032552 ysgol yn y ddweud y bod yn y ddweud y bod yn y ddweud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0032552_0032972 Mae'r ddweud yn y ffwrdd yma.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033080_0033210 Yeah, yeah, something like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033420_0033651 Yeah, your front, your front side.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033990_0034391 Felly, mae'n ddweud yn ymwneud, ac mae'n ddweud yn y teimlo.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034391_0034801 ac yn ffynol ymlaen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034801_0035814 the top screen as we've said would be an inset black and white LCD touch screen which would
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0035930_0037058 have all of the available functions for the remote on it, whereas the bottom screen would just contain the stand buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0037058_0038061 like the volume up and down, channel up and down, you know, around the nose. And things do that perfect.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0038061_0039089 And now we also decided on the inside we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezel
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0039240_0039783 logo on it or something in set or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040004_0040229 No, not at all.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040229_0040867 No, I'm interfering with the whole look of the product when it's not on the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040867_0041709 And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics. Thank you very much. That's the champion logo.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0042881_0043105 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0060100_0060169 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0063870_0064567 Yeah, I probably put it... two or three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0064567_0064642 Night 3.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066278_0066375 I'm just
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066839_0066952 Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0068639_0068737 I'm doing a one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0069005_0069175 No, no, ond y tu.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080119_0080264 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080340_0081046 Mae'r cwmhyslwyr yw'r bwysig yw'r bwysig.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0081046_0082045 Mae'r ddweud ychydig yn ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r ddweud yma i'r
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082154_0082482 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082589_0083208 No, no, that's the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put around it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083208_0083491 that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083801_0083950 Yeah, I'll give it a long shot.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0087592_0087662 minimize this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0090559_0090965 Yeah, I'd go for a five actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0093454_0093931 Yeah, it was a voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0094276_0094535 Yeah, yeah, that was true.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095126_0095345 I think dude.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095602_0096244 I think it would probably be a standard. It would be a standard. It would be quite loud. It would be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0096244_0096449 And if you didn't
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097153_0097308 Yeah, well.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097680_0098250 I do realize that we're not doing fairy-bars because it isn't fair.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0102290_0102604 Mae fe, iawn, mae cwm.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0114834_0115187 Mae'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'r rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid i'rhaid
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0115809_0115964 Well, no, no, no.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116133_0116678 Mae'r ddweud yn 3 o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116802_0117113 yn y gweithio, mae'n gweithio.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0117466_0117955 So would that be two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118064_0118366 Yeah, one of them had one sample sensor and sample speed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118818_0118949 No doubt about that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119293_0119443 Yn ymwneud, ond mae'n gwybod i'r llwyddiad.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119850_0120257 Felly, mae'n ddweud.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120464_0120574 One double curl.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120693_0121171 Mae'r cerdd yn ddod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0121776_0121846 Peace guys.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0122318_0122413 Maybe a little blank on that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0125714_0125931 No, no, that's it's it's including
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0126045_0126679 So that shouldn't be actually on there because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0128633_0128764 Yeah. OK.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0130421_0130825 Yn ymddiwch, 1, ac 1, ac el-C ysglaen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0131134_0131227 But
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0138203_0138312 Let's look up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139752_0139857 Come on again.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139938_0140207 Mae'n gwneud i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwyl i'r cwmhwyl i'r cwyl i'r
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0140518_0141065 You might be assuming that that is in Euros
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141065_0141279 It could be in dollars.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141279_0141927 and then we'd be fine because the exchange rate we haven't been dealing with dollars though
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0143648_0144016 Yeah, the standard, I mean, would make one difference.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144016_0144324 The biggest one would be taking away if you took away.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144543_0144579 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145099_0145444 If you take away the voice, I don't know what to say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145444_0145718 If you take away the voice recognition then you've got it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146347_0146418 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146418_0146869 Where's the voice recognition? It's Sample's sense of Sample speaker.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146869_0147206 Rhaid i'n ddweud ychydig yw 12.34
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0147540_0148015 Yeah, but you minus three plus two
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150154_0150760 But they buy me in I don't see why we have to serve 25 years now
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150760_0151132 because they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0152684_0152856 Rydw i'n gwybod, rydw i'n gwybod,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0153005_0153128 Yeah, it can say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154713_0154772 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154997_0155203 and the time our kids
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0156794_0157060 I'll do it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157060_0157389 Evet, bekletsin.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157389_0157688 Was it 12.5?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0163776_0164224 Because that was just a bolt on x-ray, you could just take it out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0164377_0164535 and the reform.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0165505_0165598 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0169504_0169624 I'd say it's a T.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0170117_0170307 Oh, it's your future.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173464_0173955 Yn ymwneud, rydyn ni'n gwybod i'r ymddangos.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173955_0174893 Mae'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi, ac mae'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi'r ffordd yn ymddi
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0174893_0175366 We didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0175366_0176275 Ac rwy'n credu bod yn ymddi'r ffordd yma yn ymddi'r rhan. Felly, ymddi'r ffordd yma yn ymddi'r ffordd, mae'r ysgol ymddiadau yma yn ymddiadau.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0176275_0176799 Ie, rydyn ni'n meddwl yw'r ysgol yn ymddangos.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0179518_0179601 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182025_0182333 I think it's the best wish for us.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182963_0183503 Yeah, I think we probably would have used the actual email system more had we actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0183706_0184183 had had more time and if we'd been separated more.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0193972_0194451 I don't think the companies are really concerned.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194451_0194929 they're just like, we've got a DVD player, does anyone remember their own control?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194929_0195222 Can't you get the one that we used for the last one?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195222_0195447 Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195447_0195953 They don't really think about it because normally the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195953_0196277 They're trying to ship the DVDs like video, but then when they...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0209117_0209327 I think that was just the physical.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0210588_0211064 I think but you were saying that that's quite I think in the remodeling
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0212327_0212444 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213821_0213994 I'm so excited.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213994_0214279 It's a conspiracy going on.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0214279_0214376 Ha ha ha
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0216025_0216367 I am the problem as a project supervisor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0218350_0218423 Misal edin
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0220460_0220881 Was that not the questionnaire for how you felt you'd done in your life?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221156_0221346 Ond ydych chi'n meddwl i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221346_0221542 Yeah, that's... yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221542_0221919 I think question seven was the one I did just before moving.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002299_0002344 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002906_0002963 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0009468_0009897 me and William worked on a prototype and I think William is going to make a presented panel.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010362_0010480 I like it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010605_0010822 Yeah. I'll show you the presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0011596_0011657 Oops.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0012565_0012623 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0013210_0013453 Oh, where is he?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0015304_0015388 It's gonna have a...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0020479_0020798 Yeah, yeah, it would be so insane.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0027429_0027532 I like it too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033228_0033450 If I could be honest.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033450_0033533 the front view.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033648_0034164 Oh right, yeah okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0035666_0035739 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0039896_0039971 but not into the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0040482_0040557 그
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0042426_0042675 Снимись.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0044834_0045037 I think this is a good shape.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055079_0055182 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055336_0055621 Is it everybody's going to evaluate or just...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0060095_0060228 Yeah, I'm saying the X.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0065308_0065495 I'm too full. I'm full.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066323_0066378 on the street.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066756_0066816 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0069892_0070123 That's what I'm saying.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070123_0070298 The first one reading I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070298_0070429 Can you just make it two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070543_0070603 the plus
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070603_0070757 Yeah, I just thought it doesn't
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070898_0070995 E-E-E
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0071117_0071242 Yeah, I guess so.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072069_0072130 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072878_0073085 It is a bit of truth.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080695_0080800 The white hole.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080800_0080861 Oh my.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0082600_0082771 Yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch, mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud yma.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0083007_0083114 Because of the wrong.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0093601_0093754 Зоис
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0107878_0108004 I don't know why I'm doing that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0109655_0109698 That's it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0115001_0115080 to the print.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119093_0119208 sing one double K
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119371_0119432 It's still lovely.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120299_0120367 There's just one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120773_0120865 because one
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122178_0122445 That's tickle one and maybe a little blank on that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122756_0123099 I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put 0.5.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123349_0123443 Yeah, cause it'll
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123549_0123800 I think it allows it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123800_0123894 you can use that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124252_0124459 means we are not using a lot of rubble actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124459_0124535 It would be like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124679_0124956 A very low quantity of rum compared to plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0130211_0130272 Push buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137174_0137358 I think we could change the battery also
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137358_0137594 So, we are going to put kinetic, how we are going to put a standard battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139161_0139263 and go back.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139789_0139960 It's not calculating.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141567_0141760 We haven't been given
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141989_0142114 여러분은 제가 생각하는 것 같아요
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0143373_0143511 going to a doctor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144422_0144689 What I feel is customers never said anything about the battery, you know.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144689_0144939 It's internal, nobody looks into the battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144939_0145209 But shape and color.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0145866_0146022 with that special flow.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0146133_0146305 Felly ydych chi'n gwybod y ffordd yw'r wneud?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0151558_0151753 In our recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157223_0157350 Yeah, we have to do much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157501_0157589 was it
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0158800_0158933 to explore the fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160150_0160473 I don't know but it said 50% is the cost.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160473_0160647 The top of the board.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0161295_0161388 I think that is a plus.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0162472_0162610 kriyaan
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165317_0165375 Seems like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165580_0165807 Take supplies for the admission with me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0169703_0169821 I think you do.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171331_0171714 Yeah, I think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171714_0172027 It's not like people trying to cut each other.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172027_0172218 It is more of a cohesive team work.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172218_0172557 We came to a very pretty creative design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172672_0172761 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172892_0172964 Yeah, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172964_0173137 Then sir you coordinated the look
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0179596_0179920 And that was the best part of the film.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185416_0185717 ஆமாம், இப்படியும் நிலையில் நிறுவனத்துவிடும்.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185717_0186263 I think it's good like we spend times individually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0189474_0189743 I never thought of remote control with a flip top.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191020_0191204 That's mine.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191664_0191739 Yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192004_0192079 OK
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192175_0192251 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0199681_0200613 Surprising thing is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every month you see a new launch or something like that. Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0200613_0201118 and new television products coming up but nobody giving much idea to this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0201118_0201302 I think that was the thing I was really into.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0210559_0210707 Maybe if people can paint.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0213665_0213719 the occupants.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0215140_0215234 This is a fun clip.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0216751_0216948 Celebration, you didn't talk good night.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005586_0005769 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005769_0006085 I think the first thing you do is introduce ourselves.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006200_0006547 and with name and what your function is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006547_0006729 So maybe...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0008798_0008859 And your name is?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010788_0010851 Very good.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010851_0011071 And as you know, I'm Betsy.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011071_0011307 I'm the Project Manager for today.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011307_0011817 So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012134_0012611 There's the opening, quaintance, tool training, work.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012611_0013238 The tools, I think we already, I guess the tool is really the computer, as far as I can see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013287_0013804 Each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013804_0014097 project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014097_0014616 I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014944_0015168 Here is what this thing should be.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015168_0015754 This thing here on the design is a new remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015754_0016232 should be original, trendy and of course use a formula.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0016519_0016699 So maybe I'll make some notes of that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019638_0019744 All right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019744_0020164 Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0020378_0021157 That is, it's going to be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021157_0021820 The same goes for the conceptual design. There will be individual work and then discussion afterwards.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021944_0022212 detail design. Same thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0024394_0024545 I can't, I just...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025468_0025736 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025736_0025774 All right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026002_0026470 Then, two training, triads, a whiteboard, but we control the favorite animal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026470_0026872 Does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026872_0027252 so that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027468_0027612 You want to go, Eileen?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027758_0027986 without hanging yourself.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0028810_0029082 And remember you have to press so it works.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0030752_0031064 That's a fat cat.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032052_0032258 and you're fronting.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032258_0032750 Would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033022_0033083 No, no.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033083_0033153 No, not okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033357_0033549 I didn't get to that late.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0036725_0037272 is a project finance which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037272_0037593 Selling price is supposed to be 25 euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037725_0038609 Profit aim for the company is 50 million euro. The market range unlimited, meaning international.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0038740_0039364 and production costs should not exceed, hopefully should be less than 12, 50 euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0040381_0041267 So these are all things, of course, to remember with the budget and when you design to materials, cost, etc.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0041916_0042758 Now, the discussion, I guess, is does any one of you have experience with remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0042895_0043324 We use them, right? Every day.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043324_0043499 and
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043656_0044399 Now, having used the remote control for years, does anybody already have like an idea, like things you didn't like with it?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0044399_0044923 things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing, any first ideas.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0045037_0046058 You like to be smaller, bigger, or have more buttons on it, or maybe clearly better marked buttons, you know, things like that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0046515_0046621 small right those
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0048672_0049526 So it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051311_0051812 It should be something new. It should do something different than just what we have.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051812_0052107 Now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052422_0052829 like trendy you know like earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052829_0053345 maybe in different colors or materials or you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0053345_0053873 So yeah, shapes, right? You know, like kidney shaped, feels better in your hands or something, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055123_0055827 That is true. They put the newspaper or they put it behind a plant or you know whatever.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055827_0056564 And suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the TV off and say, why the hell is my remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0056614_0057317 Well, or if it's really in a dark spot, that it keeps out a sound or a signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057471_0057593 The floss.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057674_0058145 I've lost signal with me. So it was signal, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058567_0058790 Exactly, I mean just that's what I'm saying
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058790_0059260 I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's being brought to light or
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060567_0060957 Okay, my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060957_0061646 in other words if it's like in a dark spot meaning you know like newspapers on top
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0061646_0062032 a sweater is on top or it's behind the plant.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062032_0062575 at that moment it's like what you call it the light sensors you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062575_0063003 in that moment it has a sensor. It gets a certain darkness.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063003_0063476 It has a sensor and it gives out a signal, whether that be a light signal or a beep.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063476_0063721 I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064129_0064224 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064224_0065078 You have to have some kind of sensor. And I think voice or clapping that's not specific enough.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0065078_0065848 I know they're the lamps and stuff, you know, you can clap on and off, but I think they only work to a certain degree.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066408_0066480 What we're
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066770_0067159 Oh yeah, will but then those can be we can't help every book well
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0067808_0068395 We have to move along. Yeah, we have to move along. But I think we have some good points to start with here.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068584_0068849 Okay, the next beating will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068849_0069212 I think you all, did you get the notices on your computer for this?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069212_0069545 Okay, so you've got the notice.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069545_0070163 the working design, I guess that's the function ID with this
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070163_0070398 industrial designer. That's you.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070746_0071113 So we're looking for a working design when we come back.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0071572_0072011 and then the technical function, you or the technical function, so you are the working design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072011_0072439 So you have a working design and then a functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072439_0073430 And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in general.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073430_0073594 That would be your idea.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073594_0073824 And of course, price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073824_0074169 They did. They did. But the price is a good price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074169_0074465 I mean, the price is given, but that was...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074633_0074679 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074944_0075008 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075138_0075610 and you will get specific instructions for that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075610_0075784 I think that's the end of the show.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0076472_0077087 So we have time to two, three minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077087_0077357 Any questions at this point?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077357_0077595 or suggestions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077780_0078716 I think basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions, I guess you can...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0079796_0080194 Then we see you in about 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0080194_0080361 and see what we can come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009185_0009269 I'm Jan W.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009269_0010740 I am my role as an industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0042869_0043119 We use them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0048170_0048273 temperature inside
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0049278_0049524 Machines basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0051779_0051874 Now, of course,
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0052783_0053265 different colors or materials also.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0053809_0053924 I'm saying, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0057201_0057472 or a signal or something like that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058148_0058588 Maybe it should have a light so that we can just recognize where it is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058588_0058634 et de la fin de l'année.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058700_0058795 That's what I'm saying.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0059086_0059303 before light.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0063430_0063763 or a beep, I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066398_0066528 what we've done.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066611_0066715 because you're silly because
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0068207_0068311 Good points.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0069165_0069233 for this.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0070461_0070773 Yeah, it's functioning. Yeah, so okay. So
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071171_0071568 Working design, yeah, it's a really different functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071725_0071875 technical functions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079125_0079260 I love you people.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079260_0079395 Yes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079652_0079781 All right, well, see you.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006739_0006909 My name is Fransana.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006909_0007661 and I'm a user interface. My role is the main responsibility is user interface.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0007661_0008083 And my role is to design a television remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032223_0032416 Yes, I'm glad to know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032416_0032508 谢谢
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033158_0033336 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033747_0033963 She does.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0034799_0034978 I'm not going to do that sleep.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0035586_0035895 Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0045394_0045442 I
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046146_0046571 Yes, I feel that all the remote should be very compact. Small.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046571_0046979 Those which we get here nowadays, it's very long.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046979_0047276 and it should have multi-purpose.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047276_0047914 like the remote control which we use for TV, it should be used for some other purpose also.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047914_0048673 like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating systems.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0048848_0048946 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052105_0052326 Yeah, design should be different.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052326_0052544 almost all the
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052790_0052882 Yes, maybe.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0053067_0053246 materials also
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057312_0057325 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057704_0057778 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057858_0058016 Sık ne olur?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0063866_0063918 And so
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0066540_0066638 because
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0005725_0005770 I think so.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0006154_0006257 Yeah, that's a good thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008339_0008533 And I'm a marketing person.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008533_0008694 I want to figure out how to sell them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008882_0008969 My name is Eileen.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022046_0022155 same thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022276_0022645 different types of design that we're going to be concerned with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0023611_0023838 So, perception.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024101_0024250 Hmm.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024812_0025104 Maybe we should redesign it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0025279_0025469 After we finish the remote control, we'll get to that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027623_0027852 Okay, I'll see what I can do. Whether you're...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027852_0027889 We
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0028008_0028551 See if I remember how to draw kitty cat or a rabbit or something.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029006_0029219 That's all I have to say.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029219_0029775 um
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0030798_0031573 That's a fact. I'm very sad.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0031573_0031812 And it likes to sit like that. Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0032877_0033282 Am I supposed to wear both? No, no. No, that's okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035732_0035806 Oh, okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035999_0036482 I hope the kitty cat is hungry, so I don't like snakes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0039523_0039851 to keep everybody on their toes and challenged.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0040286_0040648 So these are all things of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0049614_0050276 Well, that's 12.50 euros per.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050378_0050675 Well, we know, so we get a really good sign, and maybe we can do that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050780_0051357 We certainly can try to agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0051736_0051776 this has
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0053853_0054232 friendly shape. Yeah. That would help.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0054232_0055025 I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap. Because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0055025_0055113 I can't find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0056602_0056712 Well, or yeah, or
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0057264_0057676 Yeah, so it should either be floss or light should blink.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0058039_0058091 signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0059225_0060571 Do you think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a flap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond? What should you have to do to make it beep or blink?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0062554_0062623 in that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0063909_0064125 So the light sensor would activate the signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0065819_0066177 But it could be some place really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066522_0066689 No, because you're silly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066689_0066793 because people are so...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066866_0067777 and those people we can't help by every book. Well, it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0067777_0067999 You know, you have to move along.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0074525_0074986 We have to justify that by having sufficient features to make itself that price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0078758_0079163 I think I have to think about to our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079163_0079283 I love you people.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079650_0079774 All right, well, that's it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0080380_0080453 Okay, very good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0003732_0003865 Okay, so everybody ready?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0004717_0005869 I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0006079_0006733 I think the marketing manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0007843_0007903 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0009559_0009705 participantes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010096_0010373 Okay, okay, this way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010629_0010753 Uh-oh.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034130_0034686 one other appliance or maybe a lamp to wind up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034686_0035355 We have received instructions from higher up that certain things should not be considered.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0035355_0036262 The one thing, for example, something to eliminate, maybe that's the teletext because that's outdated. Okay. The internet.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0036262_0037062 And according to higher management, it should only control the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0037062_0038107 mostly because they feel that it's too complex a task to include other things and they're concerned with the time to market.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0038285_0039112 And the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039112_0039508 and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039508_0040221 so that it's easy, that they can be easily identified as a product of the company.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040221_0040704 and that there's no mistake, but it could be somebody else who is bringing this up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040704_0041353 So I just wanted to check this here so we're not getting too much off track here with the things we want to look at.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041353_0041995 These were instructions from higher ups, so we have to eliminate these things.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041995_0042510 But the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0042638_0042729 Okay?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056303_0056460 and uh
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056599_0057157 Who would be next? I guess that would be you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0057229_0057449 You want me to get your spine?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058082_0058319 and you are number three, number two
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058319_0058366 Namaste.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060454_0060526 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060798_0060871 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0071692_0072250 That's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0083585_0084194 Well, it's possible. Yeah, well, that's been it. So that's a push and give point now.

AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086748 It just built that to be basically young.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086928_0087468 There's a budget we're looking at if you build one model that's going to make a big difference whether it's going to be square or...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088357_0088405 Oh, yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088531_0089146 I hope it's a market. We'll have to look at the budget on that, but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089146_0089183 because we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089549_0089661 Silly. Silly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089733_0089875 like an American nation.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096671_0096935 A little elderly, a little usury-tick, you know?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096935_0097875 and it's a small button and they don't press it exactly you know something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0100099_0100191 get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102284_0102486 because the clock would be really friendly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102808_0103154 You see the scene where you could be at no other.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0108556_0108634 Yeah.

AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0119741_0119918 And that's it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120040_0120160 You are too
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120306_0120341 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0121071_0121245 What do you want?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0127901_0128111 on the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0128111_0128168 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0130485_0130598 for a certain age.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0149375_0149515 ٹائمر کے اپنے
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0150288_0150602 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0153384_0154275 On my slideshow, basically, we have already done the agenda. And on the closing, basically, there will be lunch break and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0154275_0155070 However, the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155070_0155734 and what function, working design, how does it work?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155734_0156064 So these are the two things we should come up with.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0156064_0156654 So the first thing is maybe a little easier on who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157093_0157263 I guess in many ways everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157448_0157621 everybody who has a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157798_0158314 Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158314_0158496 They are few, but in general not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158673_0159520 Now, talking about the target group, which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0159520_0160519 We have earlier, it was mentioned about, for example, elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160519_0160975 So I think that's one group that's certainly important.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160975_0161845 Then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0161845_0162455 and I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0162455_0163223 I mean that's a question, whether that's important that children can really use it or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163447_0163714 So these are just some thoughts I have on it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163714_0165367 and I don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're going to design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we're talking about different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0165367_0166225 whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0167876_0168847 a lot of bargaining pull. That has a lot of appeal, but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it, whether we're looking at different groups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0168847_0169322 I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0169322_0170178 You know, like you make nice and pink fluorescent banana color or whatever. You make a banana shape one. Yeah, for example, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170178_0170467 But the question is really who is our target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170623_0170867 Do we look at one target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170984_0172090 And with the 25 euros, you know, can we can we afford to have I'm asking the technical people here whether to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0172297_0172966 sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group, how much would that throw us?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0173074_0173490 out of the cost we are supposed to respect.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0175538_0175628 with
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0176298_0176399 Well, that's the family.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0179785_0180380 The question to be addressed here is only who is a target group and how will it function?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0180380_0181272 And I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons, you know, within the target group or subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0181272_0182218 The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182218_0182431 I mean the basic design they understand will be the same.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182431_0183428 But the question is, how much will that set us back if, let's say, 40% we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons, for example?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0183533_0184353 So that remains to be seen, but the target group as a whole is basically everybody with a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0185553_0185747 Yeah, well that's the question.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0186847_0187426 Well, maybe there's an idea. You know, the new, for example, new portable phones.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187426_0187816 They have like removable plastic cases. Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187816_0188477 So you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0188477_0190040 that in each package you have, you have for example, you have, let's say, a fluorescent blue on it, but then you have another color or a stripe or whatever that already comes in a package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190040_0190371 And then if people really want more colors, they can buy separately.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190507_0190650 نعم
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190927_0190982 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190982_0191694 But like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0191694_0192696 and they can go to the store for a few francs or euros, whatever, they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it, for example.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0194549_0196111 Well, I think the idea here is to design one remote and the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics, if you want to put it that way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0196111_0197066 having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197287_0197556 I've been at Stugles and I guess that's the old message.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197828_0197944 finish me now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197944_0198241 Um...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0198892_0199452 But I think we do some more research. I think to sum it up, the target group is basically everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0199452_0200023 If money permits, we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200145_0200247 I agree, send me.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200474_0201028 Do we agree on that in principle? Like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201207_0201447 So now I understand it's lunch break.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201548_0201631 And...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201778_0201922 So that's what we want to do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202220_0202324 So thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202439_0202690 and we'll see you after lunch.

AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057335_0057454 Yeah, yeah.

AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059092_0059158 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059376_0059594 Can you get a full screen please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059841_0060125 No, that's like, come on, we're gonna have a good...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060245_0060521 Ja.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060521_0060592 and talk to you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060771_0060994 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060994_0061373 I am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061373_0061644 Can we go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061832_0062592 The method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0062592_0063941 it takes the power from a battery, say battery, it can't be an electric supply like you have to like switch, connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0063941_0066293 it should be a battery because remote control should be like you should take it to wherever you want. And then this integrated circuit takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into infrared bits and it sends it to the device
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066293_0066601 like a TV or an air conditioner, something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066643_0067027 remote controller is specifically designed to a single device.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0067027_0068629 if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0068629_0070147 it should recognize the waves which are coming from the remote control and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote control will send a signal
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070147_0070757 and the TV it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070757_0071600 change the volume control. So I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0071851_0071905 management.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0072628_0073653 So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073653_0073867 So you can control whatever you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073867_0076040 You want to change the channel, you want to control the volume, you want to mute the TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations. There should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and TV can perform the actions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076111_0076315 So I'm getting good at the next slide.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076382_0077721 I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller. I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much of the investment also.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0077721_0079412 It's like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller. Those we can make like fluorescent, they'll be like emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0079506_0081211 and there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that this is not a you know action
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081211_0081515 there can be no action taken to that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081515_0081690 and there should be a child lock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081690_0083182 like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like if you have kids and all then they'll be playing with remote controllers so you can lock the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0083182_0084080 make it usable for more than one device it's hard but it's possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084080_0084245 Yeah, you'd quite know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084245_0085364 and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and um so that's good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0085488_0085806 Det är en kallörs Det är en fang shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086009_0086577 No, no, no, I don't think it will be like you can have you know, if you want it just build that to be basic
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086627_0086683 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086683_0086926 It's just as cheap so it doesn't matter.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088300_0088570 Yeah, that is not possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088713_0088792 Yeah, that about should do it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089120_0089205 porque é a Zuriada
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089635_0089884 for children like the nation.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089884_0090028 That's going through.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090210_0090371 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090440_0091106 and the buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091106_0091392 If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091392_0091748 If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091748_0092561 So I think we need to make some buttons which are like intended for two or three operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0092561_0093299 like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel. If you press the other button in another mode it will change the color.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0093299_0093901 So if you want to have less buttons, we can have that option, but I think it will complicate the matter more. I think so.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0094196_0094311 English user interface.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0095879_0096045 I mean you and I
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0096256_0096337 time change
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0097647_0097780 being girls and they're very
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0098176_0098450 Mae'n gwybod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'r mod i'
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099002_0099208 Yeah, shapes also different.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099208_0099290 a triangle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100079_0100646 But we'll get to that with you. And also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguities. That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100706_0100788 That's a good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100893_0102201 and display clock if you want more features then we can display a clock it I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit yeah that's that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102313_0102440 because the clock could be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102753_0103119 Yeah, you see, see, we're in your computer.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0103811_0104056 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104056_0104880 components the main components may need for it like buttons and underneath that there should be switch
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104880_0105030 and the bulbs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105030_0105851 Like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on suppose.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105851_0106265 then the remote controller should automatically have a light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106384_0106796 then it will be like if you switch on your TV through another source.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106796_0107456 not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107456_0107578 Maybe we can have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107578_0107880 whenever the TV is on, remote controller will have a light.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108020_0108277 and then in flora bulbs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108277_0108576 This is later when it is done
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108668_0109143 and battery, there should be a battery for power supply and a chip
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109143_0109521 which is like a brain to the root controller which does all the operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109521_0110074 and wires connecting all chips which is lights every time so there should be wires.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110167_0110652 And of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110652_0111183 you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to give a shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0111509_0111579 Håller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112017_0112192 I'm gonna need these guys.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112286_0112464 Next time, slow it please.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112611_0113850 I have referred the site, the homepage of the website from where I have got few points.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0114021_0114147 That's it from me now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115275_0115370 It's not like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115370_0116172 I have referred the page to get new ideas of what can be the working design to how it works.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116450_0116514 If you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116568_0116646 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0117636_0117926 It's actually there on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137491_0137642 Все.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137642_0137890 If there is a club then it can be a club club.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0149124_0149678 later and use it. Okay, it's like a timer. Timer. Yeah, and then you can use it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0157482_0157685 也好还是静运
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0158170_0158348 don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0175767_0176417 We can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0176666_0176809 and a bit of lychee.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177578_0177728 Yeah, of course that we can do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177728_0179020 But specifically if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a big remote controller So maybe specifically you can design a big remote controller for elderly and for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179020_0179123 about the electronics.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179295_0179446 It doesn't come off.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179728_0179872 Does the question
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186614_0186661 There's the.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186661_0186947 I don't think none.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186947_0187015 There's an idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0190462_0191133 mobile phones, we have different covers.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0194588_0194668 I think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198668_0198931 Yeah, maybe.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198931_0199144 I think we do some more research.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200029_0200753 Do we agree on that in principle like my
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200825_0200991 and be able to do that on.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0202280_0202326 Thank you so much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0026925_0026998 Somebody take a
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0027570_0027685 still the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0071586_0071643 Thank you.

AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0097699_0097754 and they were
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0102334_0102375 because
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111068_0111184 Merci beaucoup.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111410_0111519 case holder
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111519_0111649 who removed all.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0119903_0119972 spent due.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0120208_0120273 No, no, I'm three.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121036_0121146 Looking for the
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121146_0121371 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121442_0122422 As a user interface designer, I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122422_0122697 Can you please go on to my next night?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122697_0123822 So I found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far-off distance, at remote distance.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0123988_0124081 Now for that,
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0124081_0125332 A remote controller should have a switch on or off button by which a user can set anywhere in the room in front of the TV and it can control the different functionalities of the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0125332_0126793 There should be a signal, something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television. If the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume, he can change it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0126978_0127965 Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user choice.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128388_0128951 So if you want to view a particular program at say 9 o'clock, he can set the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128951_0129389 and the TV will automatically switch on at that particular time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0129389_0130658 So he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0130658_0131316 then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0131316_0132153 And one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0132383_0133347 The remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV, television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0133347_0134209 and this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T, an alphabet for more compactability.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134353_0134816 and there is one more point which I noted it down.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134816_0135989 like the material which is used for remote should be human friendly, it should not cause any skin disease or something, some allergy to either children or to an adult person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0135989_0137124 and it can have an alarm clock. A person if somebody wants to get up at around 8pm and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137124_0137523 And I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137830_0138232 Yes, and as Janvi said the buttons can be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0138232_0139184 We can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons. So different buttons will glow differently.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139184_0139773 So even in the dark, they use again, no, what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139914_0140886 and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0140886_0141138 He should not be harmed in any way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0141528_0142412 and find things. I found out in different sites that there are different remotes which can be used.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0142412_0143443 There are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities. There are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0143608_0144513 So you have different types of remotes with different light source, which I use, which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of the television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145325_0145407 listen
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145632_0146151 These are my few preferences like it can be used for multi purpose use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0146201_0147193 It can be used as a TV control plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing and it should have a child lock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147193_0147988 And then to save electricity, there should not be much more lots of circuits and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147988_0148961 and if a person, if parents wants the television to be switched off by 10 o'clock, then it should be switched off at 10 o'clock automatically.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0148961_0149228 so that nobody else comes later and uses it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0149547_0149771 Yeah, and then you can use a timer as well.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0150148_0150198 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0157657_0157792 I ddweud i ddebygwysr yng Nghymru.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0169295_0169374 You know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0173696_0175737 Generally, we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from 10 to 40. And then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people who have nervous problems.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0176300_0177029 In a family, there will be an aged person, children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0177029_0177625 They would like to buy just one which can be used by all the three
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0179221_0179323 Thank you so much for the interview.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0192775_0194536 But yeah, I have a doubt like, will it be cause twice effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0195575_0195659 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0199939_0200079 within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0003972_0004279 Just put on my microphone here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007539_0007703 Okay, we're ready to start right now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007998_0008644 Well, could you put my slides up because I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009682_0009830 for the president for.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009830_0009886 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010847_0010963 And, and.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010963_0011958 Okay, well, I think we have introduced ourselves so the functional requirements is part of my goal, but why don't we pass right to the second slide.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012069_0012334 That's where my discussion starts.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012334_0013030 All right, well, since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013030_0013619 I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013619_0014672 And the reason I just put that there like that is that in the initial stage, I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0014672_0015069 You can say anything you want in my house, silly, it sounds, you know, it should run your car.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0015069_0016531 it should heat up your mug or it should turn on your seat heater, whatever you want it to do. And then as we go on, what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0016562_0017633 So I'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's going to be to add a feature or how expensive it's going to be or if you're time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0017633_0018011 It takes five years to develop this. It's just something you can't do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018011_0018921 So in the beginning, just have a big puddle of things that anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018921_0019778 And then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer will try to then prioritize those.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0019778_0020047 So that was what I meant there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020047_0020887 And as I said on the slide there, consulting the industrial engineer about that. And the other thing is time is really going to be as important as money.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020887_0021322 because if we're going to sell this thing, I think the best time to sell this is Christmas present.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021364_0021801 25 euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021801_0022222 We want somebody to see it and I think it's, I just gotta have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022222_0022406 and take out their wallet and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022406_0022828 So it's going to be really attractive, but it's got to go to market by September.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022828_0023485 because anything that you don't have already out there in September showing it around isn't going to self-work Christmas.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0023485_0026102 And then I'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color. And I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026131_0026563 Tell me, coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026563_0027101 and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's going to make somebody take out their wallet, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027101_0027851 what's gonna really be what they call the sizzle, because we gotta sell the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027851_0029054 A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just going to take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029054_0029206 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029486_0030625 I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the whole house idea really isn't going to be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0030625_0031175 So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying you can suggest anything.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031175_0031708 I'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031708_0032924 not something like, you know, whole house control. And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0032924_0033501 at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at. We should be able to make it work the TV, the VCR,
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0033501_0034381 the stereo set, maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034381_0034459 at the one dot
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034568_0034638 something
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038132_0038212 Of course.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038308_0038440 Bye!
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0041820_0041895 I want you to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042700_0042838 Alright, thanks for that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042838_0043738 Um, alright now, other things that I found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0043738_0044093 a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044093_0044900 And that was 34% and even more important. The thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044900_0045388 So those are two things that we definitely do want to address.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0045388_0046099 We want to make it as simple as possible. We want to make it obvious and intuitive to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0046099_0047160 And then the things about finding it, we talked about the light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047160_0047734 And I think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047734_0047873 Okay, can we go to the next slide, please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047965_0048737 Okay, so my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0048737_0049169 That is the selling point, the thing that's going to make it an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049169_0049802 Because once there's no be back, well in sales they always say, you know, be backs don't come back.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049802_0050107 If somebody says, oh, I'll come back and get it next week, you're dead.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050107_0050250 They're never gonna come back and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050250_0050983 You've got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now, now, now. Now is a big word in my book for selling this thing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051054_0051832 And in order to make it really saleable, we've got to shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051832_0052603 We have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion. So that's why I'm saying simplicity is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052603_0052895 Finding it's important, obviously. You can't use it if you can't find it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052895_0053566 So we've got to concentrate on the features that help you find it. And I've already said this several times, but I put it down and writing here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053566_0053911 should be an attractive impulse purchase at 25 Euros.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053911_0054476 So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it, they say, 25 euros, I'm not going to take that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054476_0054921 has to be so great that they're going to say, ah, 25 euros isn't much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054921_0055696 And then maybe a motto like, we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0055696_0055895 Okay, that's about it from me right now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0071650_0072292 Yeah, that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0075399_0075459 the integrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0083710_0083926 Да, я с меня и возбираю на танцы.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085300_0085700 That's good for a marketing point of view. It would be a fun shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085700_0085982 You say that won't add too much to the budget.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085982_0086172 No, no, no, I don't think it's...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0087557_0088267 Do you think there's any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons, but maybe several different shapes?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088416_0088504 I can't.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088504_0088682 because I help with the marketing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0089144_0090328 Because we had something sort of sexy for adults. We could have something sort of silly for children. Like an angel. Like a door. Or a little elephant so they can remember where it is.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0093904_0094930 I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss with the user interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0094930_0095705 I think one of the things people were complaining about when I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0095705_0096316 the changing modes with something. I mean you and all four of us, we work with computers all the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096316_0096672 changing modes is nothing for us, but people who
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096845_0096954 You know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0097752_0098520 very frustrating. And it's the kind of thing people learn by feel. And you don't feel the mode change.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0098520_0099118 So maybe having buttons be there is shapes might be helpful. Yeah, shapes also differ.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0099118_0100076 You know, like a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100076_0100251 But we'll get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100587_0100676 That's right, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100676_0100766 Now that's a good one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0102143_0102905 Yeah, that's a good one. Because the clock would be really friendly. And why is your favorite show coming on?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103084_0103293 Yeah, and a lot of times there's not a clock on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103293_0103559 and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103559_0103774 That's good. The cock is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0114715_0115075 So we should visit this site and have a look at what's up there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116205_0116375 So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116540_0116634 Okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0117284_0117607 Did you go back to that slide where she had that side up?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0118011_0118110 Yeah, okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0135833_0135885 I just
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0137802_0138030 Yes, and as John we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166276_0166737 Well, you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166737_0168094 So if you design something that's very attractive to children, the mommy please mommy please, you know, we want it now we want to go to the store and see it. That has a lot of marketing pull.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169274_0169314 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169762_0169980 We make a bit of a shape, honey.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179007_0179132 What about the electronics?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179132_0179323 that's not really gonna change much as it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179406_0179688 That won't change much will it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179808_0179911 To jest...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0184362_0185216 That's right. And can we, is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185216_0185658 or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185658_0186120 the same electronics and they say that all that's going to be different is the plastic case.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186120_0186575 And in that case, we could probably molded plastic isn't all that expensive, is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186575_0186754 Here's an industrial person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0188725_0188880 There's a real idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0191056_0191112 Wenn es nicht so ist, dann ist es nicht so.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0192228_0192322 an alternate package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0194615_0194841 I think the idea here is to do this.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0197756_0197905 We're finished with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0198506_0198918 Well, we may have to come back to you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0200114_0200201 Okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0201029_0201159 Okay, it's very long.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004216_0004299 Hello, everyone.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004479_0004718 How are we doing?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004927_0005625 First we're going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0005625_0006870 In the last meeting, the marketing manager had presented her method of working, meaning gathering suggestions
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0006997_0007904 from everyone to see how she best could market this product within the budget that was given.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008138_0008820 In general, the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008975_0009457 It's also an item that people lose a lot.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009457_0009814 So, where should I address that?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009814_0010097 And of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010196_0010416 That is very simple to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010556_0011343 In addition to that, to make it sell, of course, the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011343_0011676 or like she says, put some sizzling to it in one way or another.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011777_0012321 so that the people are buying it now because in particular smaller items
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0012321_0013004 That's a very important fact because if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013079_0013750 Also mentioned was it should have a very short learning curve.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013868_0014315 and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0014486_0015156 Our technical manager has then said that he feels it should have a chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0015303_0016034 that has infrared bits and it has an interface controls the chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016141_0016636 Therefore, messages will be controlled in the same manner.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016636_0017055 There should be extra features like lid buttons, maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017055_0017265 If too many buttons are pressed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017385_0018387 child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018493_0018818 You could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018818_0019144 also mentioned was maybe different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0019338_0020355 So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infrared bulbs, battery, chips, wires, and maybe some kind of a holder.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0020468_0020854 for the items.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0021026_0022213 Frantino, who is our interface designer, has mentioned that the...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0022213_0022856 of course you'd have an on off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023009_0023561 Particularly if it's maybe small children that they couldn't watch a channel that is undesirable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023561_0023683 It should be compact.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023683_0024093 her personal favorite was it should be T-shaped.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024093_0024326 and maybe having an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024326_0024794 and the material should possibly be of non-allergic nature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025022_0025699 the different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025804_0026480 maybe it should have electricity saving feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0026583_0027722 and even possibly a timer so that people can program their favorite program right from the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0027908_0028452 Are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Yes
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0028659_0029094 Okay, then we I'm looking for three presentations.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0029094_0029975 And I don't know whether the order matters much. I don't think so. So whoever wants it. Yeah, okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0030610_0030733 Okay, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0031419_0031552 I'm sorry.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0032145_0032361 and that's number two
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037338_0037392 9 or 10.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037392_0037633 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037796_0037911 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037911_0037995 Yes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071148_0071367 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071367_0071681 any comments on her presentation?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074229_0074411 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074936_0075179 No, I think these are representations.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0075179_0076320 But as far as the decision making, we're getting back to that later. But if I just wanted to know whether anybody had anything to add to her...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076418_0076442 right.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076735_0076947 Who wants to go next?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077090_0077226 Okay, and you want this
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077711_0077778 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0078760_0078872 compounds design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0098452_0098489 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130408_0130522 You have more pictures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130522_0130739 We have five minutes to the end of the meeting.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134033_0134113 Okay, well thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134248_0134577 any particular comments by anybody?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0137498_0138269 We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0138383_0138486 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0151820_0152029 uh that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152200_0152485 concludes the presentation of everyone.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152485_0153203 And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0153362_0154015 And so what do we think on the concept?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0154112_0154194 off to remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0156370_0156455 That could be our...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0158654_0158929 Well, you teach, you have to teach.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0161998_0162607 Okay, before we get too far off here, the components of the concept is the energy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0162607_0162897 What kind of energy do we foresee?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0163699_0163926 Okay then chip on print.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164176_0164267 and the case.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164267_0164756 And I think we all agree on the case we want to have something maybe bright, colorful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0165479_0165739 any design compact and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166028_0166645 user interface concept, interface type supplements.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166960_0167250 I will be your area.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0167951_0168227 I guess for yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0168722_0168921 I'm not sure what they mean by supplements.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169317_0169382 I like new
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169701_0169802 I was beat tricking
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169802_0169923 Right, right, right.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171259_0171654 Our next meeting will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171654_0172685 And the idea is to, this is the individual actions to be taken until then, to have to look and feel design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0172871_0173724 And the UID is supposed to come up with the user interface design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0173847_0174301 and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0174301_0175288 In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Frantin, have to work together on a prototype using Modellin clay. It says here.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175288_0175809 you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175954_0177111 If you have any questions, you know, you can always contact me or your coach, I suppose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0177327_0178398 So I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in 30 minutes according to our time table.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0178752_0178832 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0004829_0004877 Good.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0040287_0040407 Mm-hmm.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077014_0077070 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077209_0077282 discipline.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077830_0078010 and the next one. So, oops.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0078010_0078122 It's just the old one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0079698_0080715 This time I am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0080715_0080945 Can you comment on the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081013_0081722 I have just briefed down few components which we require for the remote control construction.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081722_0082429 The first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit, battery, etc. etc.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082452_0082974 It can be a hard plastic one so that it can be strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082974_0083549 even if you just, you know, if it falls down, then it doesn't break.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083549_0083753 So it should be strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083753_0084199 and there are no harmful materials used in that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084199_0084349 and it should be recyclable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084523_0085230 And yeah, and also using of coloring comp comp comps like if we want to have different colors
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085230_0085823 blue, red, green. So we have to use some coloring component, components.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085884_0086444 and the second important thing is integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0086444_0087057 We can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087057_0087957 if it is not efficient then everything is going to be like less efficient so we should have a highly sophisticated one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087957_0088348 and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088348_0088688 Suppose FF is 38 degrees outside 40 degrees outside
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088688_0089579 it should be able to resist the temperature, high temperature and low temperatures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0089579_0090048 and it should be equipped with timer and alarm facilities.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0090140_0092106 And the other component we have in the remote controller is a resistor, which is like, it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor, which is a, I think it's like a battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092199_0092360 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092605_0093019 a diode, a transistor, a resonator
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093019_0093692 These are all the technical electronic components which we have to use in a remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093692_0094109 battery I would like to suggest one thing if we
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0094162_0095016 if we will be able to make a rechargeable battery then we need not go for a high performance battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095016_0095434 even if it is a low performance battery it can't charge much
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095434_0095628 It's not a high voltage battery
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095628_0096094 And also, if it is a rechargeable one, then people can use it for a long time.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096094_0096748 So in that way we can cut the cost but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable once
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096832_0097215 and we have a circuit board in a remote control belt.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097215_0097446 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097446_0097754 and how it works, how the remote controller works.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097754_0097852 when you press a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098639_0098714 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098714_0098982 when you press a button, when you do that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098982_0099792 you complete a specific connection that means when you press a button there will be a small circuit underneath the button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0099792_0100604 and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0100604_0101397 Suppose you have pressed channel 1 button, number 1 you have pressed, then the chip will know that the number 1 button was pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101397_0101770 It produces a more scored line signal specific to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101828_0102181 Every button, every individual button has its own more scope.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0102181_0103151 Suppose the user has pressed button 1, then the circuit will generate a specific Mars code to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103151_0103896 and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the LED, which translates the signal into infrared light.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103896_0104247 Like you have got a signal by pressing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104247_0104633 that Mohr's Court has been generated by the integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104690_0105088 And now that signal that Moscow has to be amplified by the transistor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105088_0105449 that is the use of transistor V which we use in the remote control unit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105449_0106205 it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the LED and which translates the signal into an infrared bits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106205_0106914 The sensor in the TV can see the infrared light and seeing the signal, it reacts appropriately.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106914_0107871 that when it sees the amplified Morse code signal, then it will know what action it has to do.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0107871_0108100 then it will do the appropriate action.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108100_0108406 So this is how the remote controller works.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108608_0108739 Can you go to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108818_0108950 Yeah, I have few pictures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108950_0109602 when you look at the remote controller, this is a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109602_0109775 and I'm gonna explain it to you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109916_0110176 and we had a few buttons and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110176_0110781 And if you open the remote controller, you have this circuit board and few electronic components.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110781_0111206 like you can see a chip there which is having 18 pins
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0111206_0112252 and also a capacitor, three resistors and also resonator and the diode transistor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0112409_0113165 the electronic components, all of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode, transistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0113411_0114156 Yeah, you can see the TA11835 labeled chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114274_0114940 You can also see the two green things are, they are resistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114940_0115695 and just beside that you can see a transistor and the cylinder shape that one is a capacitor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0115695_0116236 And also there are resistors, sorry, there is a diode.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116236_0116386 Can you go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116498_0116663 So this is the circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116663_0116861 The green one is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116861_0117506 Actually building a circuit board is pretty easy and also it's inexpensive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117506_0117850 It costs less than what you print on a paper.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117850_0118489 because when you are building some circuits and also wires,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0118489_0119311 it's better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a bulk and it's just printing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119311_0119607 nothing like you know you don't need to use wires and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119607_0119842 it is not exactly wires we are using.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119842_0120132 It's just printing something on a board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120132_0120531 those prints will act as wires and circuits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120671_0120979 So that green thing is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120979_0121709 and also you can see there are like access for buttons like when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0121709_0122749 the circuit under the button will be activated it will it will get some signals from it and it will it will it will send the signals signals to the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122749_0122929 integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122929_0123067 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123124_0123528 So these are the circuits underneath the buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123528_0123781 Can you see the black round mask?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123781_0123904 They are disaccused.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123998_0124113 Thanks, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0124113_0125076 and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0125076_0126004 But a push button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126004_0126666 For schools we have to go for a sophisticated and full completion.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126666_0127306 And as energy source we offer a basic battery, more engineers, a hard dynamo.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127306_0127968 a kind of provision of energy. Modern watch is that you shake casually to provide energy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127968_0128534 So that also we can have in a battery or we can use solar cells.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0128993_0129358 The product can be delivered into different cases.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0129358_0130124 Usually the cases uncut flat that we see usually a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0130672_0131029 Yeah, maybe I have just one more slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131214_0131805 like we can have materials such as plastic rubble wood titanium but titanium we can't use
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131805_0132583 and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the print.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132583_0132975 also it includes the infrared sender
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132975_0133592 And for the movie just to develop a sample speaker.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133716_0133830 Ja przeczytam.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133922_0134042 So I feel no anchor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135352_0135967 No, no, no, the scrolling was different. You can go for switches like buttons or scrolls.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135967_0136326 which we used to do before, ten years before I think.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136326_0136783 Now nobody uses it because you need sophisticated chicken and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136783_0137172 So I think it's better we go for ordinary buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0137172_0137325 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0155951_0155980 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0156682_0157287 I agree with that. But I'm very much thoughtful how far it will work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157287_0157809 because speech recognizer has a small distance problem.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157856_0158196 It's not distance problem, it's recognizing a person's voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158196_0158744 like maybe different people will be having different voices so it can be like everything.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158875_0159324 to get a good recognising system.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0160727_0160814 Yeah, but of you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0164914_0165021 Thanks.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0165087_0165205 friendly and strong
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167428_0167885 like the switches, like we use buttons for user interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167992_0168050 Ik heb een busje gegeten.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0169896_0169937 Mm-hmm.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0178831_0178919 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0021374_0021488 Interface to face.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0029733_0029926 little like it's that yeah
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0030545_0030674 Can I have my slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0032580_0032667 back to spring three.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0033756_0034196 As an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034196_0034711 how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034904_0035003 next.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035170_0035689 Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035689_0036777 This message could be switch on off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching on to a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0036777_0037125 Like you can have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 up to 9.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037733_0037769 Pardon me?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037914_0038091 Yes, nine numbers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0038297_0039313 and then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0039580_0040685 Then you should have a next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0040685_0040793 next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041040_0041593 Then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041810_0042459 then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on at elevation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0042459_0043076 For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have subtitles in English.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0043076_0043969 then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044193_0044767 then there should be some buttons which can control features like the color
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044767_0045303 color of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0045677_0045873 Now there should be a memory switch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046272_0046472 There should be a mute button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046472_0047301 Suddenly if a viewer gets a telephone call and if he doesn't want to switch off the TV
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0047301_0048236 but he can reduce the sound, he can bring the volume down and he can watch while talking, he can watch the TV.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0048236_0048884 Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049045_0049572 It's an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049852_0050709 So remote can be designed which can have the voice recognizer. You can record your own voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051039_0051517 which can be recognized by a voice recognizer in the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051517_0052189 If you want to see the ninth channel, if you say just say ninth channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052189_0052811 The remote will automatically switch to the ninth channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052811_0053586 So the TV will have some recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0053586_0053930 So this is one of the very important features a remote control can have.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054117_0054527 So this is one of the interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054720_0055229 a very simple interface which has all the important features.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055337_0055442 Please, next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055573_0056263 These are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056263_0056861 And so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056861_0057360 So you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057360_0057596 even a kid can use that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057596_0057810 So can you go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057900_0058505 So this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0058505_0059282 And this has multi-purpose use. It can be used for TV, it can be used for cable satellites, it can be used for VCR, DVDs and audio.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0059519_0059766 and this has inbuilt voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060165_0060335 Getting up to the next knee.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060335_0061014 Now this is an interface for a remote which a child can use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061014_0061664 This is user friendly, it's very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061664_0062022 And this comes with different colors, different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0062692_0063723 and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0063815_0064076 attractive child interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064655_0064779 It's a little busy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064779_0065694 Now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace in its own way.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066114_0066729 This is a very big, you can have misplays with any of us.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066729_0067250 So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to misplace or lose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067389_0067648 This is one such interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067837_0068986 And the personal preference would be to incorporate speech recognizers which will respond to users voice for a particular function.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0069197_0069294 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0072873_0072896 Yes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0075564_0075593 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0108382_0108416 the next week.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0113958_0114005 So,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0137241_0137310 are in.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0154766_0155184 Yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0155994_0156254 This could be one feature which could be sellable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159121_0159844 No, it's like you're recording a question already.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159844_0160229 And then you're expecting an answer from, for example, you have a TV system.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160229_0160992 I am the user and my family members are the user. I will already record a question like...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160992_0161438 Good morning, like around 8 o'clock, I want to see the news in the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161438_0161756 So I'll say just good morning and the TV will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161756_0162029 It will recognize my voice and it will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0164881_0164970 Go on, bags.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0165119_0165290 It's really strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0167885_0167954 Kuşbetin
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0168978_0169657 Some different types of features buttons. Yeah, like like Chris, but like Chris, but
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0178837_0178885 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0028468_0028599 Okay, I got pretty much the same.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065632_0065748 You don't know me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065748_0066286 I could lose that in a minute.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072037_0072494 Well, looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072494_0072892 What I'm no suggestions bad
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072892_0073178 but we're going to have to narrow it down a little more.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0073178_0074006 I don't think that we can get the T-shape is good, the child one is good. It's too big to misplace. I think it's just funny.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074006_0074814 I don't think that's going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074814_0075047 It's gonna be a little bit
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075159_0075207 Yeah, but
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075476_0075617 have to come back to that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0076254_0076643 No, I think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0084611_0084654 Good point.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0128530_0128654 That's interesting.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0134648_0135275 On the scroll and the push button. You can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0137109_0137442 We'll just go for push buttons, or in the interest of cost.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138188_0138348 I'll be right to my first, my next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138641_0139591 All right, my method is I'm interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0139591_0140222 And so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140222_0140793 I spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140793_0141346 And then when I'm out in people's houses or meetings or anything like that,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141346_0141886 I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have, and if it can be in the conversation, I ask about it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141886_0142148 I would encourage you all to do the same.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142148_0142685 And my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142685_0143016 People like something that really fits in their hand.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143016_0143144 Simple is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143144_0143839 They don't want to have to squint at small print. They want buttons whose functions are obvious.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143839_0144355 and they want as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144355_0144558 They want each button to do something.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144558_0144676 and eye catching is important.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144676_0144923 It's got to look appealing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144923_0145145 I'm trying to finish fast for you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145145_0145782 And our preferences as far as I'm concerned are we've got to get to the market before the competition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145782_0146250 ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146250_0146840 so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146840_0147354 and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0147354_0148032 If we try to sell people that has too many great features, the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148032_0148872 who've got to narrow our selection down to two things, I think, that we're going to say are really great about our new product.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148872_0149481 And I've been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149481_0149939 And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149939_0150324 And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150324_0150982 They're more back into soft feels, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150982_0151470 So those are things maybe we want to look at as far as saleability of the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0154519_0154897 You want to try to come back to yours?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0155631_0155945 So speed track recognition is most important as far as you're concerned.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156276_0156529 Yeah, that could be our star feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156529_0156793 That might be really good, yeah. I agree with that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0157714_0157817 distance problem.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163036_0163363 I think we all agreed on that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163363_0163659 That's going to be most cost effective and the best thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0164816_0165230 bright, colorful, trendy, trendy, and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0168945_0169070 So we'll see you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169264_0169694 Yeah, or like crispy chicken and also a new supplement.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169694_0169928 Speed, recognition, speed, advice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0170012_0170726 Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible, pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0176912_0177406 Where were they hiding?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0003938_0004133 Well, hi everyone again.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0004324_0005440 Like before, I have to reuse the minutes from the last meeting. And so here we go.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0005591_0006464 It was discussed in the last meeting, which was opened by the presentation from the interface.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0006567_0007903 designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the TV.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0007903_0008979 It should have 9 channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, color contrast, sharpness etc.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009020_0009435 for different memories, which mute button in case the telephone rings or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009435_0010653 Speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to be integrated in this new remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0011091_0012013 Should be a child-friendly design with few buttons, colorful, maybe with star-shaped or other shaped buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0012013_0012926 She presented also an oversized remote, which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013217_0013332 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013485_0014410 but her very personal favorite really, she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0014410_0015315 The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0015315_0016438 She would like a special paste made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colorful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0016564_0017116 should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0017284_0018010 She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0018010_0019144 Technically, this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode, transistor, resonator, and if possible, a rechargeable battery.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019263_0019471 and of course the circuit board.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019599_0019852 and how it would work. You press the button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019852_0022001 the chip is more code related, relates to the generator amplification. And the circuit board is very inexpensive to build. And so she thinks this is a great feature to consider
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022216_0022696 She would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022804_0023264 The scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0023384_0023891 should be battery operated and of course you would have to special cases.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0024040_0025146 The marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0025146_0026273 has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0026431_0026654 easy to use and it should be eye catching.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0027036_0027745 From her point of view, of course, one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0028058_0029057 To do that, maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on, or in other words, on which our campaign could be built on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029213_0029697 too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029697_0030149 So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really given home.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030288_0030916 It should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030916_0031126 She feels that's really what people want today.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0031293_0032097 And the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0032218_0033189 The energy should be battery, should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong and should have buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0033325_0033798 And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes, from the last meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0034072_0034535 Now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0042922_0043023 Mm-hmm.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0046331_0046436 Needy?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052178_0052253 What kind of button?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052399_0052600 A menu? A menu? A one? One?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064279_0064480 Yes, the buttons are all raised, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064566_0064651 raise and if
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0065317_0065522 Move it up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0067081_0067808 Yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to first go like oh, yeah, I hear it's all and yeah the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0069570_0069806 So if you left-handed or right-handed.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072255_0072883 I have one question. Will there be anything written on the buttons?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072883_0073380 like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0073933_0074457 will have symbols so that the user really knows it doesn't have to be good points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0074976_0075613 But anyway, it has to have some kind of symbol text or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075772_0075805 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075924_0076155 Okay, I just want to make sure that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0076927_0077000 Right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079005_0079329 Now what are our special features for the marketing?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079329_0079718 That's really the voice recognition that's really unused to...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0080276_0080937 And then any other thing would basically be shape or practicality of use.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0081109_0081159 Well.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084293_0084575 Okay, now having said that, I'm
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084864_0085297 No, now this was our evaluation criteria, which we just have done.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0085297_0085576 Now we're going to talk about financing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086184_0086437 O ne, je se produktione i valvešinje.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086485 that you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086604_0086809 but that's after it's financing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086872_0086929 by the sea.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087539_0087996 Okay, we had looks and voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087996_0088686 Okay now on the financing we bring up the... there it is.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0088686_0089440 Okay, energy source, we say that's battery, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0089637_0089762 Okay, down.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090085_0090281 So we, I guess we use one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090983_0091358 seller chart you were trying to change the code for it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091358_0091446 Oh, that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091530_0091813 I told him I could just change it to a new name.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091913_0091984 干什么呢
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092731_0092979 Oh, how can we? Yeah, okay, let's see.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092979_0093328 Okay, one. Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093328_0093443 I'll go away.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093443_0093918 kinetic source. So that's in the energy source, that's all we need.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093918_0094226 electronic simple chip on print.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094226_0094356 Is that what we're using?

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103051_0103417 Total 7.6 whatever that means
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103665_0103782 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104079_0104235 8.2
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104683_0104824 Let's
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104967_0105054 8.2, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105236_0105427 So we looks like we are
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105564_0105656 well within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0106093_0106272 I should say this I suppose.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0107999_0108108 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108661_0108807 I just like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108807_0108969 Now I don't give you this computer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108969_0109144 I miss you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0109683_0109836 Okay, fine.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110140_0110431 Okay, good. So that's the good news.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110431_0110834 You're going to be popular.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111164_0111424 So that I think financing was pretty simple.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111535_0112165 Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0114600_0114759 You want to go to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131419_0131783 I just realized one thing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131783_0132180 In the financing, there was no room for our voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0132429_0133181 And I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0133554_0133711 8.8.20, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134116_0134616 I mean maximum we have another 4.3 euros I mean 4.30
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134767_0135522 But we have no way of presenting that to management as a finished...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0135522_0136083 as a finished product and saying okay, we serve a waste recognizer that costs so much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136202_0136654 So we just have to be aware of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136654_0137085 I mean, and know whether the 430 will really cover that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0139488_0140779 I'm sorry to interrupt that, but I just remembered that there was no room for any special features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0140907_0141086 So we'll give you a hand with that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141086_0141328 You want to go to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141540_0141654 I don't know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141654_0141780 I think that was my last thought, John.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0144286_0144428 by any that are
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0145622_0145736 I think you can make it there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0148505_0148664 Yes, I think shape is one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0149756_0149886 You give it a full.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150247_0150389 I don't know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150516_0150699 I think that would give it at least a two.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152596_0152725 Colorado.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152988_0153157 I like the colors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0154776_0154971 I think I will give it a 2
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0156922_0157788 Well, it's also you can't really try it out. The other things you have more is are more tangible. So from that point of view, but
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0158088_0158204 I'll give you the three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0163765_0164417 Here is what we're looking at satisfaction, for example, room for creativity.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0164981_0165391 Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0171858_0172740 Yeah, obviously bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still, you know, we probably can't
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0172740_0173341 with this particular item we probably can't just add a whole lot of more things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0173341_0174395 We need to live space money-wise for the OS recognize.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0174986_0175438 So the question really is how do we feel with the project process?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0175438_0176658 Are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0176806_0177143 I think, personally, I think I'm pretty happy.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177258_0177401 And
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177613_0178216 And then the next question is, are we happy with the leadership of this project?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0178586_0179168 And I think teamwork I think was very, very good. I think we could work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179398_0179899 And I think we are happy with the means we use.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179899_0180315 we used whiteboard, we didn't use digital pens against these things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180745_0180864 Yes, we could.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180927_0182201 It's maybe not in the best position in the room. Sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody. And I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0182303_0183135 because it was better positioned. Yes, I think so. I think absolutely. And fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183135_0183441 Did we find new ideas?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183441_0183527 So I think we did.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183727_0184471 I think we did in more than one respect and so I think we did very well here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184719_0184848 are the costs within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184848_0184947 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184947_0185232 i su pročeg te evaluativ.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0185367_0185861 Then celebrate it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186464_0186776 So I thank you all very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186776_0187153 I think this was very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187272_0187669 I think we did come up with a new product that's feasible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187669_0188086 feasible from the production point of view and feasible from the marketing point of view.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0188280_0188412 So, okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0189421_0189660 I always get it on here, I love getting it off.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0190479_0190598 Oh yeah, we have time.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035625_0035939 So this is what we have made.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035939_0036376 This is a model of the remote controller which we are going to be
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0036376_0038147 This is in a snail shape, so it is attractive and it's blue in color, bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons, so it is look wise, it is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038147_0038429 and also compact in shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038429_0039128 and also it will be easily fitted into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039300_0039665 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039828_0041301 The material which we are going to use for the case is plastic which is strong and also for the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0041445_0042426 The material is plastic and for the buttons it is a soft rubber and oh that's good. Yeah, that's awesome friend
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0042426_0042999 Yeah, because you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043039_0043332 and then for the lead
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043332_0044239 for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0044413_0044878 and the button button spot will be explained by Fawcena
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0062030_0062128 10
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0073522_0073605 These buttons will
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0074614_0074775 going into an international market
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075161_0075253 You have to have something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075541_0076079 That we can have on the case itself. That's right. We printed on the case. Okay. I just want to make sure.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0077042_0077318 on the snail shell. He goes right back into his shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0078699_0078921 or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0094238_0094352 Is that what we're using?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0096277_0096347 This is them.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0098501_0098936 I think that is just for the case material.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103508_0103763 I think that's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103915_0104042 We do it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0108986_0109101 I'm here
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133675_0133765 And
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133822_0134090 It was so much for your else to go. Just bad.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138186_0138315 that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138953_0139031 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0140240_0140346 included.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0148666_0148936 Okay, yeah, she was

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0153266_0153342 Yeah, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0155570_0155756 Maybe two
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0158869_0159019 Trit?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165533_0165606 We'll be back.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165682_0166106 Yeah, include some more buttons and features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166106_0166342 we can make the buttons few buttons smaller
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166342_0167206 I think they are quite big so I think I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0167206_0167460 if we want to have more features in that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0168404_0168517 That's me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0169338_0169663 Yeah, that's not having too new buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0177249_0177331 uh
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0178437_0178646 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0180636_0180757 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0183540_0183677 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0188433_0188521 今日は良いました
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0189656_0189882 We still have some time left.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190111_0190291 You have got it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190908_0190969 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0034881_0035112 just to look alike the button part eyelash.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0044970_0045542 Now we decided upon including certain features and are remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0045542_0046564 Now these features includes the signal emitting signal, it's the LED or NET, the infrared.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0046564_0046958 Now we have included the switch on and off button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0047312_0047703 Now we have included another feature that is the mute button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048112_0048363 on the side of the model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048363_0048767 Then we have included 1 to 9 buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048890_0049190 for controlling the programs, the different channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0049751_0050264 We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0050738_0051294 And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0051690_0052136 Now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052259_0052337 menu better
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052416_0052502 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052613_0052695 at the center
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052836_0053649 We have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color, sharpness, brightness.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0053896_0054005 of this picture.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054300_0054709 We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054854_0055307 Now this is a special feature which we have included.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055307_0055379 Now this button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055525_0056591 is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible. So if it is turned towards the right, it will take to the previous channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0056591_0056916 If it is turned towards the right, it will take to the next jump.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057045_0057353 to take the user to the previous and the next channel. So this is about
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057662_0057755 Swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0058428_0059316 So swapping is, for example, you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059316_0059420 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059919_0060901 And at the end, this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer, which will recognize the user's voice and then it will act accordingly.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061477_0061773 So this is a proposed model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061773_0061987 now the marketing expert has to
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0062120_0062796 give her suggestion when it will be sellable or it will be cost effective.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0063532_0063628 Yes. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0067684_0067788 And yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0068745_0069236 These are the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069236_0069323 Yes. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069916_0069948 Pardonne-moi.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069986_0070147 This is the menu on this one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0070404_0071261 These two are to increase or decrease the volumes. And these two are to scroll the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0071408_0071569 and subscribe to our channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0073384_0074001 Yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols will have symbols
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0074001_0074203 so that we can be easily like the user real
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076128_0076730 And one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076730_0076808 a shared share.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076928_0077026 Vai.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0077093_0077224 He goes right back.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0078678_0078822 Yeah, he's the thing like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0096360_0096459 Симбалка
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0098878_0098991 Okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0101930_0102129 Yes, we do have special phones.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0103669_0103947 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0104663_0104891 That's points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0108498_0108598 in the gesture
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0123878_0124032 That's what people are going to do.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0138250_0138356 us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0140728_0140766 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0147847_0147931 Okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0155305_0155381 That gives me
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165536_0165724 The beginning of this improve.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165869_0165978 his features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0171906_0172054 obviously bearing in mind that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0178402_0178668 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0180493_0180786 a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0185498_0185849 celebration
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0188429_0188486 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0190292_0190402 It's 40 minutes
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0013037_0013522 She was challenged on that point. That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0039502_0040024 You used to have all the buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0042228_0042451 Oh, that's good. Yeah, that's awesome.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0046289_0046397 or NED.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0052441_0052514 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053828_0053902 of the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053902_0053969 this up
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058041_0058417 the next channel in a numeric pattern or
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058778_0058833 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0059376_0059485 Okay. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0062821_0062982 Okay, well...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063112_0063579 When I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063579_0064261 But you can really hold it in one. You don't need two hands, and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0064511_0065246 The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand, you can even reach it over here. Right. So you don't have to turn it around.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065246_0065653 turn it upside down. Move it up and down. I really like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065653_0066194 I really did a good job on that. My little designers.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066194_0066948 And I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066948_0067118 That's a really good, good...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067220_0067346 So that's really...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067786_0068008 The color is very attractive.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068008_0068633 These buttons around here are the mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068759_0069052 These the front buttons which are here are the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069159_0069314 on both sides? Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069314_0069519 So you can push either one? Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069703_0069948 And this brings the menu up on the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069948_0070393 This brings the manual on the screen. And the orange ones are...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071210_0071387 So often.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071387_0071489 Slow lapers.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071589_0071843 that looks like something I can sell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0072104_0072410 Okay, and now I'm supposed to... I have one question.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0074373_0074971 We need the symbols because we're going into an international market. We can't have anything that's language dependent.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075356_0075447 symbol
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075447_0075544 text or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076158_0076217 more features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076855_0077167 for the snail. Right. We have the snail shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077167_0077358 He goes right back into his channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077358_0078888 Well, you know, I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail was known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0078888_0079032 That would really work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0079632_0080257 I think voice recognition is our big selling point because nobody else seems to have that in this press range.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0080981_0081579 Yeah. And well, I think that everybody's going to say their remote control is practical.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0081579_0082128 I think we have to dwell on the appearance.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082128_0082331 you're really gonna have the best thing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082445_0082708 cutest remote control on the block.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082708_0083555 So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image, play with the visual, and then the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083555_0083713 And I think those are the two things to push.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083713_0083762 The luck.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083897_0084011 and the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084011_0084185 they're going to be our two selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084556_0084761 I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0085663_0086259 Ah, but in my instructions I think it's how I'm supposed to go to the board and do some fun.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086517_0086566 Yeah, that's me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086744_0086822 아, 오케이.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086822_0087076 Sorry!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0087076_0087088 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0089556_0089598 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0092477_0092677 Can you just fill it in the mailboxes?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0096533_0096673 I guess it still will occur.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0097975_0098164 rubber because we're gonna have the soft buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0098936_0099082 Okay, that's special
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0100797_0101105 No. I mean, I didn't put the clock in it after all.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0112217_0112448 I'll take my file now so you can read it up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0113791_0113889 Tamam, gel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114272_0114502 Okay, why don't you move just to the next library away.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114688_0114846 Yeah, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114846_0115717 Okay, well, obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question, will it sell?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0115717_0116800 And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0116800_0117268 We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117268_0117552 and show the prototype to consumer research groups.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117552_0118356 We don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118356_0118628 So we have to get some input from those people.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118628_0119064 And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition. We like it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119064_0119388 We think it's good. We're going to get behind it and sell it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119388_0119535 Next slide please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119781_0120514 Okay, now the things that I was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120514_0120928 I wanted the shape to be biomorphic. I didn't want anything with angles on all squares.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120928_0121283 I wanted to be comfy and rannily, so we got that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121283_0121644 Size is small, the color is bright and warm, which is what we wanted.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121644_0122239 We want in the field to be as soft as possible. We'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122239_0122686 even though it's going to be hard plastic, it feels good in your hands. So that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122686_0123207 and functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0123207_0124124 So paradoxically, the other features, in other words, the look, the feel, and the shape, that's what people are going to get in the store.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124124_0124344 They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124378_0124658 So they'll be our main selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124658_0125417 So those have been fulfilled by your prototype. And go ahead to the next slide, please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0125417_0126043 Okay, so the shape I think is a one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126043_0126301 That's really, really excellent shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126301_0127341 The size is small, and these points are in the importance for the marketing. These aren't in how I feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127341_0127967 I think that it's, I think that it's plenty small enough to sell, but I think we're sort of right, the scale is one to seven.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127967_0128408 I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128456_0128620 and our color I think is great.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128620_0128975 The colors are bright and warm and really do a great job there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128975_0129552 And given the constraints that we had, I think we got it as soft as possible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0129552_0130090 and then functionality. I think you did a really good job on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0130090_0131014 obviously we could have added different functions but then we disturbed something else. So I would say that we got to a 5 out of 7 on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0131014_0131379 So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133143_0133582 Well, we had what, eight euros, 20 as our cost?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133730_0134107 And so we've got, it was so about four URLs to go to spend.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0134602_0134830 Well, um, that's...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137150_0137939 Well, as we know in today's technological world, you can do just about anything at any price. The problem is quality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137939_0138351 So we're just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0138351_0139103 and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0139103_0139488 as we've seen with so many of these kind of products.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141252_0141534 Well, isn't this my last slide?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141607_0141656 Good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141656_0141844 I think that was my last thought, John.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142274_0142365 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142596_0142934 And I'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142934_0143589 And we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now. So if you put my last slide back up there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0143817_0144241 I'm sorry. Um, yeah, to that. Um.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0144660_0144894 Well, because I can't remember what I put on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145310_0145611 I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145761_0145853 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145937_0146050 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146050_0146395 So, now we're all supposed to say what we think.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146395_0146789 Okay, so on shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147227_0147341 I gave it one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147480_0147945 with what would you... One being good and seven being the worst.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147945_0148244 What do you think the shape is?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148244_0148497 Well, okay. That's it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148683_0149060 Okay, and yeah, she was okay
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149060_0149273 And how about on sides?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149676_0149785 on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149863_0150178 I gave it a 4. I feel it's just average.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0151479_0152066 Here's the design. Of course you love to give them to you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152066_0152323 And then how about how we doing on color?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152668_0152819 I gave it a while.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152819_0153059 I really like all of us on Sprite.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153405_0153617 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153617_0153839 och här är allt det här.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0154126_0154680 taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hands.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155051_0155410 Okay, I have three, two, one. I'll give three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155687_0155789 to move.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155919_0156691 And the next is functionality, where I admit I was a little hard on our team here, but...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0158686_0158775 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159432_0159557 Well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159803_0160156 Looks like we've got ourselves a pretty good product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0160156_0161362 Functionality is the only place where we have to think about maybe having a career, having another meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0161362_0161910 But otherwise, I think we're ready to go with this product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0162068_0162501 Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that you feel we should evaluate?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0167642_0168775 Well then again if we're gonna do the speech recognition then we're gonna there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that. Yeah, definitely. For the recording of the speech.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0168775_0169598 So that's where we're going to have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0169598_0170293 and then maybe we can do something with the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170425_0170535 the volume control.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170535_0170789 You can put that all on one button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170918_0171804 a'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn yn ymddi'r cyflwyllfa'r hyn
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0177170_0177576 I'm pretty happy with it. It's something I think I can market.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178213_0178697 I think you've done a good job. Yes, yeah. Definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178981_0179274 I think we're both together as a team.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0180322_0180811 Maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182205_0182421 and then use the slide because it was better positioned.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182537_0182670 I think actually,
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0183545_0183798 I think we
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185190_0185260 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185896_0186554 Today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them we have champagne.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0188646_0188930 Watch out, I have my cord behind me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0190501_0191179 We were told we could end the final meeting at any time. Whenever we felt we were finished.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0191856_0192197 You're taking your dresses and I'll check my microphone out for my next.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0192517_0192575 There we go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447 Why I was gonna draw cat toes?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812 Just try something else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060 Different than Garfield.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246 Mae'n ddweud yn fawr ysgain.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971 Well, it's supposed to be a cat.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118 I like it because...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106407_0106456 there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0107490_0107525 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0109049_0109083 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0126778_0126843 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256 They were all mentioned.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673 Good morning. Good morning.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955 We zien jullie al op de buitenlandse plekken.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125 Are you really sitting on the right place?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629 I guess so.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003264_0003336 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809 I'm just not introducing myself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274 Anybody else needs?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415 그렇지
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801 Let's start off with a little presentation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834 First I'll tell you a little bit about the sitting
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037 You can see the field cameras here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797 They'll record our actions and you all have wires and microphones. They'll record your voice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416 I also have some microphones there, but you don't have to pay attention on those.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014 because it will despair in you. You don't have to tend to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424 Is that project documents folder?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919 There are some... ...notes in it already, I see. The documents.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145 I'll start the presentation kickoff.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968 We will have the ministry.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227 Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for real reaction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529 It's a company in drawings.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476 Fashion electronics make it work, love effort and design, it's all about itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865 I'm Bart Bluett and I'm a project manager. I'll direct you through the project.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177 This is our agenda.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771 Mae'r obeiddiadau gwneud yn ystod o'r llwythau.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902 Maybe I can sit down and take some notes or...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442 Then you can take the man's, that's mad. Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136 I don't know, it's not the wrong word, but just if you hear something, you might not just like that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525 As you can see, it's the opening.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917 I painted this point fifth down a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314 Have you all seen the corporate website already?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701 Have you seen any flaws?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949 I think I found one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019352_0019396 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753 See you at the Brooks Center.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054 There's a book here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335 Okay. Another protocol.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274 But then on the corporate information side there was real remote instead of real reaction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934 Real remote is not really the company we are, but it's kind of...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335 Okay, what are we going to do?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735 project aim as you can see a new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113 and thus the original trendy and user friendly.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811 So these are the points why we also higher G.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629 We've got a marketing expert for the trendy and user-friendly look.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214 industrial designer that's also used differently in the original.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776 And we've got our user interface designer.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206 That's about the new remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089 Our project method is... there are three phases we're going through.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568 First, it's functional and I designed it in the future of work meetings.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992 after the virtual design, then the conceptual design, then the detailed design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683 I had some little indications over here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177 But I think you know it already.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124 De industriele designer werkt op de werkingdesign, componentdesign en een beetje van de beelddesign.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102 De user interface designer gaat over de technische functie design, user interface concept en user interface design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0031102_0032189 and the marketing expert was doing a little bit of user requirements specification, trend watching and project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473 That's what you're going to do.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816 But that will be all work out. All amazing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524 Then we've got our first tool training.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263 We are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here. So it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870 As you can see we've got the smartboards here and here and the whiteboards.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579 In the whiteboard here is an ATTOL bar on this side.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682 Here are some fictions.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790 So you can save.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251 these functions we don't have anything to do with only undo you can undo a little
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563 Piece of drawing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897 a blank new document for each person.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144 Select Ben Razor
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423 I'll catch you later if there's anything.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867 Then, go up and
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005 This way.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928 You can draw with it in this way. In this form of...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305 You can also select the current color and the line width.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673 First you have to select the BAM function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011 We're going to work with it in a minute.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873 It's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings in there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081 then
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513 Sure thing about documents
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935 We've got our shared folder, project name project.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279 Word je document?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895 But you all found it already because there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697 And these are available on smartboards as well. So if you have a document you want to show, just open it from the following.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097 Here is the sample tool work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751 It's really just set it safe, brand move back or forward one page.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947 There's a switch between the different clubs.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479 And then we're going to try out the whiteboard
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119 So as you can see we're going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785 Just to get a bit familiar with it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932 No, it's because this is running away.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351 Is anybody playing with the map?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721 We're going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367 and just some of its favorite characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213 The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607 So I can start from there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177 You can use the pen by holding it like a little child.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801 Because if you hold it like this, sensors will get blocked.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366 Another thing is you have to be a bit slow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895 Felly, mae'n gweithio i'r ddweud i'r ddweud yn ymgyrchol.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051895_0052898 Just for us, we're going to call her, I think, the grayest rocket.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052898_0052990 then the night
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502 Okay, so that will be nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863 Now you'll see my drawing. Okay, good at this.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579 You have to do a little bit of stuff.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800 Trying to go both.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204 So good.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330 Yeah, let's go there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775 That way, there's another function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063 You've got your reasons.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197 and I can do
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576 This is the end.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878 That's good.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429 and go through right down a few of these characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744 Uh...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469 We got no text tool.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677 Is this difficult?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107 Maybe I should hold it a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408 That's the sign for that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073 I think that's it because if you want to increase the distance, you can strike.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319 I don't know. Just wait.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182 It's not mine.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068929_0068980 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319 This is what it's done.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319 Mae'r greu ffysgwyd.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477 Ysgrif.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194 So now I'm gonna hand over the pen and give it a blank sheet to you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838 Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126 because this is going a little better than I did.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669 It's a real dead sheet.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081 recognition.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551 Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084551_0084628 Just a minute.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666 No, just thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351 Yeah, that was good, Nick.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283 Is it your camera that you're finding on the street?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818 So, everybody knows how to work the whiteboard job?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508 If you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the line for it, just ask and go ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679 Yeah. Easy.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677 We're being held in white.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990 So we have a dual introduction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506 Move along to the project finance.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430 As you can see, for a remote control, the selling price is 25 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648 Question and prize.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946 Ik ben 50 miljoen euro.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775 That's the least we have to get from our remote controls. We have to work together to reach our Apes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717 We can do it international, so we have to focus on different kinds of users, different kinds of cultures, and different kinds of trends as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143 But that's all in the later stadium.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933 Our production cost can be maximum 12.5 Euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883 So that's also a point we have to keep in mind. We believe on remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060 Those were it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394 So just try to remember these points.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393 The selling price 25 of it aims 50 million but more important is the international market we're trying to follow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770 and production costs maximum of 12 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275 So this leads us to our little discussion.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783 You've got about five or ten minutes left for description.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140 So I'm gonna sit down I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622 I've got the message.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120622_0120698 Fuck this.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118 Felly, yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch,
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952 Maybe you have to say the magic word.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208 What's it doing?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553 Maybe if they just clip it down.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122828_0122914 Back up again.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568 Select your...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123733_0123799 itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948 It's pretty big on that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102 O que é isso?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649 That's those nettles.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124998_0126251 But the server body has experiences with remote controls. I mean, not the ordinary remote controls, but also a little bit different ones.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555 Like you can use for other.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0127905_0127958 Mm.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777 Yeah, I've got one at home.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653 You can program, I think, eight different devices in it. You can use it for your television, anything else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326 and it also operates on infrared so you have to go to the little device inside your room
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868 and then you can operate it from the third or second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716 So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs and you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893 So that's a pretty handy
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460 Ich werde auch nicht...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401 I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133401_0133481 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757 That's good to remember.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250 Yeah, it's nice. Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482 So we want different functions.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420 and we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720 But I don't know if it will exceed the production cost.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021 So this is something we have to find out, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893 and other functions for remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329 You can make it the...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137725_0137806 approve?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500 So these are a few things we can think of.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030 I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040 Felly mae'n gweithio'r llwyddiad.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726 That's an idea as well.

AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680 Any questions about this presentation?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793 Kickoff presentation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790 Okay, then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048 And then it can all work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405 Finish meeting now.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955 I'm going to be seeing a little work on our other projects.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639 We'll be left after.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0076704_0076747 She
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595 Just kind of drive it so that it...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089790_0089839 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352 Go ahead, Dennis.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097503_0097536 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097650_0097761 I got you, man.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097848_0097894 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0098652_0098803 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099099_0099154 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539 Who said it?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802 OK
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126436_0126474 Ну, вы
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126779_0126875 Really?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751 Oh, the second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137604_0137671 Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110 What a move.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494 You never know.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0141037_0141123 Okay, how much?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004079_0004149 You're welcome.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004810_0004844 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353 Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0018307_0018353 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267 I can't say I paid much attention to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0021216_0021268 Oh, yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0046928_0047006 I don't know if I should...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892 I'm not thinking of the short fish.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0071206_0071246 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613 and
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584 Okay, not much in the lightest, but here you go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833 This is my...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320 that your dog name was X-rayed in that box.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084648_0084705 We are.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084935_0084977 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049 It's going really slow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144 They're building their own animals.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316 And that's just looping.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191 So fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667 Garfield.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0110215_0110298 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120296 There you go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414 So just on the side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0123611_0123667 It's all fair.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159 Boa luz, mano.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124708_0124779 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126746_0126820 Well, yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508 kind of brought TV at home and the DVD player so they got like a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030 One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442 And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0130808_0130852 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967 So I think you can take a minute to get out.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0134155_0134240 since George O.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478 But that would be really good if we could do that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534 I think that's to be shockproof.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045 My remote control tends to fall off.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381 Yeah, one other little thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763 Felly mae'n gwybod yn fwy o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140875_0140940 So you can see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213 how much is left in the battery.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994 But they'll also really drag up the production costs. So we'll have to see about that too.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437 ..y'r ffordd yw'r llwyddiad.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0144083_0144179 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0145529_0145582 I'm seeing a little.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0147202_0147250 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232 Well, I think if we're going to use a touchscreen, we're going to go way above the 12.5 Euros.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266 So it wouldn't be very robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531 It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777 Okay, I've got a presentation about the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003 First about how it works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099 It's really simple, of course.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285 everybody knows how to remove words.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468 You should press the button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999 The remote determines what button it is. Use the infrared to send a signal to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301 the TV switches to the frequency or the function it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811 So we've got the place
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206 It's got conductive disks for every button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983 When the user presses the button, the signal gets set, goes to the lab and transmits it to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340 It's a very simple device that you can play.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614 So this is a schematic overview.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802 We've got the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017 Power source.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468 and when a button gets pressed it goes to the chip
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059 the chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324 When you press the button you can actually see your pressed button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094 Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441 Keep the inner working simple so it's robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841 I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301 because if you're going to use high tech materials price it's going to go sky high.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105 You only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it comes back in every product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046 So in my idea it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the front, I think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250 That's it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073 I think that if we put our marketing right, we can sell this just like, I don't know if you've heard about it in the news.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281 de elderly mobile phone.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249 If we make a remote control, with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872 We hebben geen focus op de design dan, maar op de functie.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940 We just
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346 change our focus on the project.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636 We can sell this.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330 That's a good idea.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275 And besides that, if we're going to focus on elderly people, they'll have to adapt.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548 They're not used to using scroll buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860 Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426 It should be possible, yes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604 Felly mae'n ddweud yn ffansi.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913 and if the remote stays rather small in Chubu-Pot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902 So we're just going to focus on the extras.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548 like we have a keychain if you play solid goods.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974 I think we'll have to choose between the docking station and the screen console.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187119_0187191 So that's all.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094 I don't think they have different television sets
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344 in every country.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002 Iefallwch yn y llwyth.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777 Okay, so this is our second meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100 and still fading.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726 Now we're going into the functional design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007726_0009245 The important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719 zodat we naar de tweede fase kunnen gaan.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959 the first in space
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273 ymwneud.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705 There is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288 There's our ghost mouse again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018 That means that you can have a little trouble with the air conditioning, that's because of this.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339 That's in Wings, C and E.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853 So it should be over in a couple of days.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438 It's going to be cold anyway, so I don't think it's going to be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584 Then our agenda.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747 Then I first the opening.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911 This time I will take a minute.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375 You're going to have a presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502 All of you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365 And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769 So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354 And then we can have a little description about the new project requirements which I think is sent to me.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291 and then the decision on the control functions which you want to include.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511 because 40 minutes were all of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947 So I suggest that we start with the first presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134 Who wants to be first?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337 Maybe it's easy for you. I think you will tell me your presentation as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787 which function you have and where are you going to talk about?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054004_0054103 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516 Anybody have any questions?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829 That's who show the coins.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054829_0054905 Okay, that's clear.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160 Yeah, I did a second.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571 Yeah, you can take your time.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860 yw'r cyffredin?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0058229_0058319 Good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638 for all but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610 I'm going to ask questions about the technical functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654 That's nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727 네, 맞아요
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130 Maybe you can first listen to your presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669 And then we'll have a little discussion about the requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351 I think it's going to be nice to have.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0102358_0102401 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926 Okay, now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we're doing right now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724 I'm the project manager, so I'm here to mess things up and play some new requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739 We got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0106739_0107827 That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096 So it has to be simple.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600 Another point is we have to skip the data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108600_0109601 because in the world of upcoming internet we think data text is going to be a thing of the past.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069 And it's a function we don't need in our remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739 Internet is also mentioned, just go, in a function you can use.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063 En ook op de televisieontwikkelingen, dat zal er wel op zijn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672 De andere is de customer is 40 plus.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578 That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257 This is a bit pity for the marketing expert.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682 because he was aiming on the younger persons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200 So we have to find a market which is above 40 plus, which will suit our...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648 remote control and the other way around.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449 and we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026 So it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572 And we have to be very clear on this point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721 So I suggest
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215 Let's have a discussion on the Confill function.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0117632_0118925 Any project requirements? We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091 against the no data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559 And I find it's easy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107 Pretty
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383 I think we cannot
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238 I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970 If we put a lot of effort in those we can make remote control with two or three buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577 or just to be more which is suitable for the market you want to reach because it is 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305 And if you look in Holland, the whole generation of 40 plus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992 50 plus it's the biggest share of the whole population now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668 But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456 that people think that's the device I've looked for although I didn't realize it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604 So let's try it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136353_0136447 It's a big success.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731 make a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367 We don't have to focus.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011 I simply think
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830 that the new products we're going to make specifically design
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726 We are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0140860_0141918 And I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419 Because what you told is channel selection is important.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809 volume, selectie, power en teletext.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055 No, we haven't footage it. I think the text can be...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587 then the function as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776 but only if it's known to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134 higher the cost.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705 because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well, but I don't think that will be a problem.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019 Where is the text?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751 So I suggest you definitely
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374 Is anybody really against data text?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956 Just keep the text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477 It's good to use well especially for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786 बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा बच्चा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा चचा च
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123 make that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725 Another point of advantage in our remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587 We make a button for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173 for elderly people that they can think, oh, I want to subtitle. Push the button and they get the big subtitles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064 So I think that can be very useful in our advantage.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617 Functionality should be few buttons, you said.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239 I think that's very important. We have a few buzzes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701 Dus het is wel simpel.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318 I think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219 We don't need it. Do you need the bethans for long to zero?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339 Mäkligt.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911 Ne dedik?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797 Maybe you can implement the scroll button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154 or joystick leg.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450 There are other ways to do it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649 If you look at telephones.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168 the Sony telephone and scroll button which was very useful in searching names or
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0163536_0163590 Yes sir.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236 This is the numbers there.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076 We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display and if it's too much we can reconsider it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328 But I think that one needs very much better.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493 or they're done.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813 Yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082 I think it's very important in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763 can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons in the right places.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041 If you have less patience you can do a lot more of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339 to operate on.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393 So I can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172982_0173031 That's right.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434 So you suggest we could better focus on, for example, the docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717 like other functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210 instead of lesbians.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671 Do you think the docking station will...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115 is allowed in the budget we have.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504 It's not too...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153 I think that's
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456 That's a good advantage point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363 if we have a fancy looking docking station or... That's a nice requirement.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0179483_0179580 the station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0180046_0180112 I think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259 That's a good boy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868 You said they easily get lost as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939 so maybe we should implement the audio side or something.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706 So we know where it is. Audio signal could be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126 I think it's not too expensive.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279 another
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692 Oh, and the LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591 I don't know if that will cost too much.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291 Seu ouvinte é um mexe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015 Just the LCD.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170 Just a normal screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190317_0190417 It smells really good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679 to some extra info.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060 I think that's a good idea as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584 This smells creepy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580 Span beton die info.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270 I think it should be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639 Let's see what did we say
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233 She'll be fancy design, easy to learn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469 few buttons, you thought about that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768 talking station LCD
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087 general functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280 and default materials.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196452_0197489 I think that's a good idea as well because all the people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688 So, it doesn't really matter.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944 So I think probably
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316 Let's specify the target group.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966 Are we talking about elderly people or people from 40 to 80?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687 Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above 60 maybe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201043_0201135 What do we want?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925 If we want to profilate us, for example, the telephone for elderly people, we can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252 Target to real, elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905 So it's still really up to.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535 En je gaat over 16280, bijvoorbeeld.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642 and different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205642_0205713 party.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008 He's got five minutes left.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0207008_0207094 And with that, I'll see you in the next video.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360 in different languages.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085 or you have to put a language button in it, but that will be a bit unnecessary.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464 It's better to put it on different markets.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880 So that's the target.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323 Then a few small things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808 Okay.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226 I will put the minutes in the project documents folder.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102 What we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432 using interface design to use interface concept and trend watching
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212458_0213492 So just keep in mind things we've said about the target group and the requirements and the trends which we're going to go along.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955 and the specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385 So thank you for this meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656 And I think we have an interesting break now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936 That's a good thing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139 Okay
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775 Ja, dat is een heel groot geval.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117 for the technical function of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215 I think we must use the general functions remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0059215_0060963 Ik heb nog een kleine research over de internet en ik heb nog meer informatie over dit.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113 I've been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844 So you've got a lot of devices like the television stereo
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317 but it must be used friendly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041 So you can put a lot of functions in one.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588 in one remote as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064588_0064676 but
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318 Ik heb een grote functionen in één remote control, maar je kunt zien dat dit een simpele remote control is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014 few buttons but this remote control got a lot of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502 Yeah, people I don't actually do that, so...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347 Well, I was thinking about keeping the general functions like AR.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665 Super, on-off button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974 keep it like a red bread.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596 en iedereen weet het, dus je moet het niet veranderen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183 That person will love preferences, so...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706 We gebruiken een display voor specieke functies van de verschillende device.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070706_0070792 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491 What I was thinking about was, you've got
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217 This is the remote controller. You can hear the general functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145 Zoals de on-off button, sound, I don't know. Hier heb je een soort display.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438 This is a touch screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074438_0075919 Je hebt een paar functionen van de device voor een DVD-player. Voor een replaying, reverse, etc.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452 We got here real buttons for selecting a device.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0076586_0078034 Dus voor alle deelnies die je kunt, dus een aparte display of een aparte buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621 so you never got all the buttons on one device.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045 So that's my idea about it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945 So that's great.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395 And the real buttons we have to use
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994 We gebruiken een groot beddening.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294 Hvis alle er på siden af at bruge det.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664 of of old people, young people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268 We moeten ook de buttons nog steeds simpel en groot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577 show up.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082833_0082896 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237 Dat was mijn car.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427 Yeah, I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751 Je had een heel gede touchscreen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069 It's not in the corridors, I think.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683 Ik ben er ook van van van die internet nog vandaag, een paar weken geleden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961 uh... you got uh... yeah, quite
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685 een soort touchscreen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287 20 euros or less
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515 Så øk, det er spørgsmål.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0089662_0089761 Yes, sir.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395 Deze mensen moeten de texten voor een subtypes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506 So it's, yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0150585_0150660 for elderly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617 I don't mean it for TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713 So we can't skip this place so we don't need it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000 in its left.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0018276_0018355 I think I'll go first.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813 my name is Frank.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965 Can you learn extra?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091 よられ、みんな
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426 I've done some research.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302 We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556 We'll have them talk about a questionnaire.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822 We had 100 of these tests done.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220 In addition we did some market research.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526 see what the market consists of.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664 what ages are involved.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460 Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753 Remotes are being considered ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963 75% of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633 people questioned, uh, indicated that they thought they were moving around. It was ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285 and an additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733 In addition, remote run up for functional.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332 50% of the people indicated they only used about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939 And 50% of the people indicated that the remote tends to get lost in their rooms.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028233_0028307 some things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894 Then we did some research to do most relevant functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664 channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867 The power button go to 9.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117 and 10 effects go to the 6 and a half.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222 So these are the most
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700 most important functions of remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927 Then there is some one-time use function.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087 That's what I'd like to call them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550 There are audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074 which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702 Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943 168 times per hour.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502 And these are the, this is the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874 The main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical under remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285 a wnaeth yw'r newydd newydd.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438 but they also are very critical.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637 They won't spend their money very easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423 The users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731 They're not really very interesting features.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997 but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811 Well, I think this indicates for...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336 I think we should make a remote for the future.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480 And this means we will...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984 I have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938 This also makes up most the biggest part of the market so it will also be where our main profit would be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342 Yn ymwneud, maen nhw'n ddweud y ddweud.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614 The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned, thought that remote control caused errors high.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217 This is certainly something to take into account.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921 And 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate new control, remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379 So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672 Decides of course that the remote must look very nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933 functionality
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727 As a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons. I think we should make very few buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175 This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670 I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162 especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539 because they're used most and so they should be robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695 They shouldn't break down easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851 Then as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in a room, it might be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678 And I say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985 but it might be a good idea to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629 This could get a button in it, which would send a signal to the remote, which would then beep.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890 so you know where it is in the room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392 And in addition to this, it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0050571_0051711 Then a surprisingly great deal of people indicated that a LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826 This was.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436 mostly people in the age of 16 to 25.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805 but up till 45 remains feasible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574 This would also greatly increase the production cost, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0053859_0053925 those we all
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0054420_0054490 Crystal.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050 and just...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058050_0058150 So I should
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058150_0058187 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837 Wel, mae'n ddweud yn fawr o'r ddweud.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089544_0089606 Let us dream.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819 Yeah, welcome to that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796 So is there any discussion possible in the project requirements?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896 Yeah, because you're saying that Teletex is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197 and new TVs will have internet access on them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863 But I think if you're targeting people of 40 plus, the chance that they will have a DV with internet access
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278 within the next like 20 years is very slim.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133 In addition, people indicated that Teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543 So I think it's pretty dumb to put no Duelitex feature on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840 I'm pretty much against it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878 Besides that, I think the market for 40 plus is like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123983_0124063 pretty small
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873 But if I say this, I think we're just going to go for another.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439 I think we can not innovative.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125565_0125638 I think we can do a
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298 Yes, but it's not the biggest part of that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973 Besides that they're not very critical, so I mean they don't really care
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315 What the remote control is like?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688 They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961 I think there will be the case in the...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414 16 to 45 h category.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077 because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605 People of 40 plus, I mean, they wanted to work, but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976 As soon as it works, it's okay with them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610 If we make a remade...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275 that obviously the board tends to disagree.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146351_0146443 So
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971 I was thinking I definitely would see a bad idea not to include that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038 I don't think it's really an issue anymore.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154163_0154263 Well, it might be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858 I don't mean it for TV, you're not going to need a lot of buttons anyway.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329 need a 1 to 0 button next channel, previous channel
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821 up, full-heam down, and some Taylor-Tex buttons, but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360 I think we need to go again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508 I think they're going to include teletech, she do.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740 I think many people like to use a navy
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506 If you want to switch from channel 1 to like 35 you don't want to push the next channel button 35 times
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525 That's true, but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089 I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238 And so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899 The TV would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220 I don't know if many channels
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162420_0162508 Do have that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612 many TVs out there.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063 But I think if you're going to make remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497 Mae'r ffordd yn ysgolwyr.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313 because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV, which already only have the minimum number of buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540 I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001 That is true, but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you're making remote control only to operate only the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897 Because if you have remote control only to operate a TV, there's simply not a lot of buttons required.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553 There's not a lot of functions required, so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184 So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602 That would cost them a big marketing
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173040_0173099 which was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663 one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market the lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845 Yeah, I think, I mean, we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153 But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428 Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733 what other people like to have in the...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039 like to have X-ray in remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443 Yes, well 50% of the people indicated that remote control can get lost.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188 Yn ymwneud, mae'n gwneud.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919 You have it on P-Chain if you want so it goes. You have it on some firms too. Which have a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252 and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0184328_0184403 So you know where it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701 I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355 and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928 It might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, which will explain a button if you press it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068 which would tell you what it does.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747 and it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or very expensive screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469 Just a small screen of it too.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307 But I don't know what's that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635 I was confident to the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437 I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0201108_0201183 I think.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807 I think that would be, if we should do something like that, it would be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198 I think it will be really good for the image of the company.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681 And I think there would be a good market for it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211 they were able to really bring an innovative product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648 Yeah, really.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196 I have to look into that a little more.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517 and with the little screen in it which explains the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794 I think it would be a lot easier to
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113 adapted to different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0214713_0214775 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673 Welke components die zijn?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321 For the entity source we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829 kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360 but if we choose for that option the documentation could become obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601 so I don't think it's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583 For the casing the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing, single or double curved casing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859 and it's really up to the design that we're gonna use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347 It doesn't imply any technical restrictions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153 As a case supplement, we could have added a rubber belt like an anti-slip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677 For the book buttons we can use plastic or rubber.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326 And the chipset, it says simple here, but it should be advanced because we're using an LCD screen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026 and as the trend watching presentation shows people like wood
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725 but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image unless we start two product lines.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913 Four should follow, four should not be wrong.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554 Well, the kinetic energy source is rather fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817 But it depends on what you want.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047 I think we should discuss that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706 For the case, the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523 ac y gyfnodd yn ymdweud yn ymdweud, ond yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0091523_0091576 That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992 Yeah, they're four options.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273 You could use the base signal battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436 a hand dynamo.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719 But I don't think that's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113 We don't wanna swing before you can watch television.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261 de solar cells.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667 but not every room is very light so it's not a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099667_0099767 or the kinetic energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754 You basically shake your remote and then it powers up
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101742_0101816 of Street.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402 I don't have any informational pricing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632 So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810 Dat zou ook voor de LCD screen gaan.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165 That's a bit higher percentage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714 And that's the best choice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947 Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100 So it's got to be advanced.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061 I don't know if you're in there.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305 I'll have to research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060 Well, the general, like most older remotes are flat, just straight.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699 En de verkeerde departement kan ook een single curved of double curved cases doen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622 It would just only affect the form for as far as I know
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003 So it's really just up to the design department what we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236 The current current really matters for the price or the function.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537 Big one. Do what I can.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534 I think we should start by choosing a case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785 Because that's the basis you're building on.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151 at this flat case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358 from the side so right normal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993 with a single curve so I'm not really sure what they're going to do but I think it's something like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632 So this type should be better for you or better should prevent.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274 And the double curves look something like this I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600 Those are the three options we have.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185 It's more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it's always a long phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030 and maybe you should just start on a blank page.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425 Good afternoon.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837 I think I've moved.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093 I hope you enjoyed your lunch.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346 And this is pretty much it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602 Um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309 Three.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844 Okay, this is the second phase we're going to discuss today.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162 De concept is de design medium.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095 and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409 conceptual specification of design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622 and also trend watching.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580 These are hopefully the points you addressed in your presentations. You're going to show me in a few minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215 First, I'll show you the agenda.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404 First the opening.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621 There we have three presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142 After that we have to come to a decision on the remote control concept.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383 Are we going to make it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600 and then we're closing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800 It was 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221 So, yes, let's get started.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747 Did someone encounter any problems during the operation?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182 Thank you. Bye.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011182_0011256 It's loose.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177 Then, a little thing about the last meeting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469 These are the points with Griggle.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758 the requirements in the target market.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012758_0013769 The requirements are data text, talking station, audio signal, small screen, and some extra button information.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987 And we are going to use default materials.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661 Does somebody have any comments on these requirements?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611 These are just things we thought of, so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else, just let me know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755 Maybe you can work it out.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334 and we're going to target the 60 to 80 year old customers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402 So now everybody knows what we're doing. I suggest let's get started with the presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012 So, you keep the same line as last time.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452 Good luck.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736 Any questions?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365 Okay, you don't get any issues.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0091739_0091784 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432 So that brings us to the discussion about insects.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825 So these are the points we have to discuss.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318 First
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021 I think we can talk about the energy source since that's
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908 has a pretty big influence on production price and image.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011 and
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927 I think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077 Well, I think it was true. elderly people just like to have everything in place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773 And I don't think they like remote just being everywhere in their rooms.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157 So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369 And also, I just said
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186 You can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964 but I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441 So you have a button on your docking station that you can push and then it starts beeping.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214 And then we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the channels.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396 I'm wondering.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198 That's a great way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477 Good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791 easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961 I think it's a good point.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054 I personally think the LCD screen we want to use with the extra information. I think nobody has anything against it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507 Het is gewoon wat extra informatie en het is ook makkelijk om te ignoreren.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757 But if you don't want to use it, you just don't use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889 And yeah, I think maybe we have to discard the voice recognition.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431 because it will increase cost significantly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946 And I don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372 So that brings us back to the energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126 If we don't have force recognition, it won't use a lot of energy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356 So in that case we could use kinetic energy but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466 That much cheaper as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353 Okay, and we just choose for the battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484 That brings us to the chip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847 We're using the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465 Okay, that's fast.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455 and then we get to the point of the case
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119 which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652 If you want to choose for wood or the black and grey
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732 We're bullet.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723 And as we saw, we're just a little more expensive to produce.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033 But I think it will attract other people who want to have something exclusive, which they can show off to their grandkids.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275 Got the new remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399 That's right.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850 But wood color was a lot more expensive.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515 I think so because yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064 It's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896 So that's the case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413 In the cell, the case, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794 I think that's a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768 Because then you can advertise as well with give your grandfather a new case for his remote control or whatever.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796 Because it's something extra, it's something other remos don't have, which we can get a greater advantage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959 So then you can make them both color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145 black and gray as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770 So you suggest we should design two different telephones?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830 Of je kunt een telefoon oplossen. Ja, remote control. Of je kunt andere kruisbeleidingen oplossen. Nou, ik denk dat we het gewoon moeten doen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767 So everybody is okay with the changing covers?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059 I think that's a good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555 So, we're in Case Club.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318 But the forum has to be with us too.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677 It has to be possible to stand up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912 or just I need to know just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416 and the cover of the the docking station is also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749 On to był w tej telewizji, nie?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158749_0158792 my little
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180 Yeah, click it in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369 That's okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722 De interface...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048 What type of interface do we want to use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709 Maybe we can make a little drawing of it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144 on the board.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381 And somebody had ideas for a forum where...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252 is a fuse will be a lot more difficult than that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349 But you have extra business.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495 so people can get confused.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086 felly mae'r rhaid i'r ddweud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234 Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173340_0173417 the same.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789 functions as the normal one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194 Then you're dead.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292 And you're good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482 Here's the screen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107 I think
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069 No, that's very handy, I think.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520 Because the pleasant mean will be opposite.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813 No, it's the finger.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349 Maybe. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117 But is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262 I think the functions are
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981 that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589 Ставь лайк, ставь лайк.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961 Ik denk dat we gewoon de normale shape kunnen laten.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365 And maybe we have to...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783 Make it a bit more fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988 in another way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709 I suggest a single curve, because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514 so that elderly people can use their remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759 because it's a bit of an angle.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0197954_0198030 I think so.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198497_0198586 You know it's...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153 Do you have an upside down or?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581 So get your buzz.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961 That's a good one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386 but I think it's better to put the screen on top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339 So I just flip it 180 degrees around. And this plate is right here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592 If you can have this one you turn it like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761 That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490 Because maybe your hand is in the way if you sit down here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207860_0207900 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208151_0208188 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288 Start on a blank, baby. Yeah. So, there we go.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838 girl
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509 Here at this bay, I'm doing good things.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175 And then we can add a little bit of hair here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421 Just that sport that's in the United States.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958 and then the rest of the business.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498 Yeah, I still have to.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344 and live more friendly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215951_0216031 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423 Thank you very much.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512 We've got a general idea of the concepts and materials we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081 So now for the next meeting we'll have to look at the fuel design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575 It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819 En dan checken we uit de Korpje website.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286 the user interface design. It's the same story.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527 and product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198 Dus de industriele designer en de user interface designer gaan samen met elkaar werken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771 better going to get your instructions I think send the body coach
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642 So I will put these minutes in the folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0221860_0223007 And then we're going to try to finish our project and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394 이틀에
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233 I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361 And then you'll get a message.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778 Salute, Salute. Despair.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026 Nee, niet zo.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240 Okay, safe as well, Minda.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225592_0225685 for this group.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653 All right, that's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788 Smart boy. There it is.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235 So if you wanna look at it, it's over there in the project folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764 And then I guess we'll start in 30 minutes again.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227926_0228011 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943 Mm-hmm.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237 There's some research about the sign of the interface.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969 Last meeting earlier about using a few built-ins.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534 So that's what I want to...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088 through our design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675 depending on the attractive way to control the remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406 I found something about speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725 So maybe we can use that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241 and using a little display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263 Just focus on the primary functions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0052279_0053386 So only a bit for sound, for on-off shifting up channel or down shifting down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0054053_0055076 We need some new attractive functions which attract people for using it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904 So it's like speech recognition and special button for selecting subtitles.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247 o'r ffordd yma'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gwe
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736 And yeah, hope for all your safranthi.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079 Dus gebruik een grote bit.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127 Het is mogelijk om een schilderste system voor speerverkenning te maken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078 Je kunt het denken over als je de remote control vervalt, je kunt het dan opgekomen en het geest opgekomen zijn.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315 So, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059355_0060394 and for shifting up a channel or for putting out the sound or something
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972 you can just give a sound off or
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248 And uh, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666 ..y'n deallu ffysg ymwneud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061979_0062017 Cheers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062017_0062107 Yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754 I was thinking about a special button for subtitles. Just one button to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187 Je krijgt een klein spulpje op de bed en je krijgt een klein zetijdel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204 Double push, double click, you get big subtitles for people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965 which can read small subtitles.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167 So, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977 Yeah, and we have to keep in general buttons, so the buttons we have to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608 De onnacht, zand, onnacht, zand, hui, lower en de namers 0-9.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499 The general button, more general one button for shifting up, shifting down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0067499_0068547 Also we want to use a little display for displaying the functions of the battens.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546 And we can build in a function which shows the channel or which television is on.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161 So, a little picture of a...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824 Just we can put up the on-off button over here in this corner.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571 en bijna alle onmogelijkse controles gebruiken we alles maar op de plek.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271 Dus mensen zullen de bal bekennen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416 So,
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043 display of het is een smal display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312 and again put it on top of
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615 ..y'r môl sy'n ddweud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199 De plezier, de mensen maken ze van looks.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041 So, um, and a special burden for shifting up and shifting down a channel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585 om te krezen dat het allemaal op de...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038 So you can easily shift up or shift down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404 So, quite a...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077560_0077623 any place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316 and other functions for subtitle one bit for sound.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304 En de overal designen, we moeten het over het verhaal hebben.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573 That's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0103973_0104066 What's the function?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374 Yeah, it's for rounding up the batteries.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104502_0104541 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864 I won't use much energy I believe.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811 Het is gewoon een klein plekje. Ik denk dat het op een batterij van 6 maanden of meer zal gaan rijden.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293 So I believe one battery is just enough.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0107293_0107332 So
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0109111_0109182 Please.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0122010_0123074 but it's a re-chart about large LCDs display or just a small one we want to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497 is het wel eens wel een chanceable case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140497_0141783 So you got with mobile phones, like Nokia mobile phones, when you can change the case of it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143 Maybe it's possible possibilities.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0142143_0143382 Dus je hebt gewoon om een standard remote controler te maken en je kunt een paar...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139 We can just use the regular form of it, but it's not quite fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0162139_0162213 show.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324 for left handed users.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165576_0165671 Yeah, we found...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715 Het is mogelijk om een programma te maken. Je kunt aan de linker of aan de rechtskant de botensverfondering schipen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669 Nu zijn er nu de boodseitbutons voor het schip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929 Um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0168784_0168851 is a fused.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0171079_0171166 Yeah, but
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417 See, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825 of je moet maken, de linker...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980 I mean, um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0174074_0174165 Yeah, you've...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0181030_0181088 Okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486 ..y'r ffordd yw'r ffordd.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687 Felly, mae'n gwybod i'r ddweud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832 building of.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195579_0195663 this vote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040 Your say is...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266 You can like, start from... here?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849 Dus je wilt deze spijt hier overleven.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945 Now it's... They have an upside down or...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055 いいですねー
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194 Let's do it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199194_0199283 this out.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043 Maybe it's possible to make this side like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425 tonight this slide
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850 We're going to the next one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217 bit like so in the form of your hands
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202217_0202304 So, uh...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202446_0202545 It's
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157 So the remote controller has to lay in your hands.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536 So, uh, it's, uh, uh, so get your.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151 and the buttons for
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620 changing the general over here
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644 So just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150 about this plate.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061 Like on your mobile phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875 I've been
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463 Maar onafbetten, het is nog niet tof.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0002409_0002464 discussion.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300 I'll start off that pretty quick.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995 I'm gonna inform you about the trend watching I've done over the past few days.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224 We've done some market research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610 distributed some more on cats, questionnaires.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021670_0022728 And besides that, I deployed some trunk watchers to Milan and Paris to get all of the newest trends.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525 Ac rwy'n meddwl i'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r ffordd o'r f
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088 the best design would be.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509 Okay, these are some overall findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960 The most important thing is the fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462 The research indicated that that was by far the most important factor.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239 Innovativeness was about half as important as fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776 By enough, this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839 about half of how important as the innovativeness was easy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0027839_0029193 For our group, we're focusing on the people of 60, 80 years old. These factors are slightly more equal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830 Okay, these are some more group specific findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102 All the people prefer dark colors.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533 They like recognizable shapes and familiar material.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093 Our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633 the material for older people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031633_0032764 This image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that we're about to have.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520 It leads us to some personal preferences.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933 the remote control and the docking station should blend in in the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226 in the room.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797 Felly, mae'n ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557 Just keep it simple and well, the docking station on the small screen would be your main points of interest
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270 because this would be the inoculativeness in remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896 So this would be very important that we at least include these features.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036896_0037901 Well, the Trunk Watchers, I consulted and advised that it should be remote control and the docking station should be telephone shaped.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470 So you could imagine that remote control would be standing up straight in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085 This is not really, this is pretty much a new shape to older people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958 So they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the document station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170 So it would be kind of more telephone shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0040266_0041314 Besides that, we would advise to bring two editions, one with the wood-like color and maybe a few, and one with a great black color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809 the woodlife for the more exclusive people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998 People with more money.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227 yw'r ffordd ffordd ffordd.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730 People of last means.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203 there would be all.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043635_0043711 of the trends.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370 and how exactly does the kinetic energy works?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100370_0100424 You just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747 your remote and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706 Well, personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499 And besides that, you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267 And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559 Get great popularity for a product.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007 What's the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196 Yeah, you could load up batteries, you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720 I think it was true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954 I'm wondering what will the FOIA's recognition mean for the production price?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557 Because in our earlier market research, if you'd allow me to. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235 So, just open it here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594 We also
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369 asked if people would pay more for speed recognition and remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827 Like you can see here, our target group would not do that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229 So if that would increase the price for which we're setting our remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667 I would greatly advise not to do it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175 I think it would be better to insert in our other product that is meant for the...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0118321_0118391 number of people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924 Well, this is, yeah, but this is, you know the question, what would you prefer it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250 So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970 And on top of that, the LCD screen would help in making the remote control easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773 And I think the voice recognition function would not make remote control much easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744 Well this was for like an LCD screen like you would have on a... you know, some times mobile phones.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971 So pretty large.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803 I think the most important factor there is the wooden color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136 So it would actually have to be would, yeah, it was just
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0138485_0138558 Good color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574 you get a greater chance.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670 We would have to look carefully into the design though.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517 because we would have to make one control which would fit in with a wooden cover and
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798 plastic cover
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153 Yeah, more original one, more standard one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184 always you can play on the phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094 Wel, nid, mynd i'n ffordd yw'r unrhyw ymlaen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867 one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305 So, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151 I heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curve. Yes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312 Could you explain it a little more?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954 and would single curved and double curved meet?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539 So you can pretty much just pick one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156788_0156823 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967 No, just to lay down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229 the cover of the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889 Well, besides it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200 You said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you could
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156 So your thumb would be easily... Well, I think that's a very good point because I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause RSI.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342 Felly, mae'n fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r fawr i'r

AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355 for left handed users.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860 Great.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985 Well, that's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721 Yeah, we could do that, but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the ease of use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0169396_0170527 But if we would make changing channels and changing volume button on both sides, then we'd certainly yield great options for the design of the remote.

AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0183930_0184002 That was true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919 I prefer the corners to be round.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215101_0215191 and
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215435_0215516 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0227946_0227988 MBC 뉴스 김성현입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318 Well, this is one me and Richard came up with.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630 De default spot voor de Yarnout button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914 De nieuwe button is gewoon onder dat.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143 Then there's the volume and channel selectors.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651 Simple plus minus button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832 Rwy'n ffordd o'r help buton.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459 Als je het op de linken hangt en je een auto op de linken klik, dan gaat het naar de afslag.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006 Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210 button for teletext
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412 button for the subtitles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547 en de company logo.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108 So it's rather simple prototype.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509 And we'll have to see from testing how the users take it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603 Sure, we'll play that there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857 I think if you look at
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312 most controls they've got more buttons than this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651 and well, the onoff button, it's necessary.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827 Yeah, probably one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305 Volume and channel buttons you need obviously needs those
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014 The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down with them twice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295 Zo, we kunnen kerstel dat wel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198 I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796 Well, come.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107 leave out the number of buttons, I guess.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775 It's rather basic already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707 Yeah, there is no more playing hard.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038707_0039817 They're supposed to be equal sized Rob with a little logo on it for them for the volume just to recognize
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922 That's a recognition.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860 Sound for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160 with a different color than the case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326 So dy, gympar.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672 Okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531 I think it's a big cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589 If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402 De dockingstation is niet zelfs in dit scherm.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799 Nid yw'n ddegon i'r hyn o'r braes?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439 Good sick money on it
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909 but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432 My mother can't even send a SMS message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716 Is het toch een tol?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859 No room.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608 You could just not scroll for a half a second.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041 If you want to use an LCD screen you need an advanced chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942 Yeah, if you could just leave out one more button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104845_0104933 大家联系一下
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706 What if you have to scroll to page 88?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015 888
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125 Je kunt twee botten uit de buitenkant wachten.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299 and just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820 If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160 So that would save two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291 if you do the same for the channel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0125541_0125614 more obvious.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0127499_0127588 Shall we freeze, Ryan?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190 If we leave out all those buttons perhaps we can go with the flat case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350 and make it smaller overall.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493 So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right behind under that, then the scroll button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801 you get a much smaller remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131028_0131056 and
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171 Richard arguments with all these changes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0173211_0173289 be level five.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147 Yeah, I haven't thought of that one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014 I think that's a free.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412 I think it's too fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585 to the flashy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806 Is this right after this?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0199991_0200038 That's true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434 Yeah, it was a new friend of the finance
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207148_0207215 Yeah, it was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687 The tasks are very strict so you can just do step by step. It's very easy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414 The smart board, the drawing is just fading the aspect.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773 It didn't look bad, it's very nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110 flip over or small or precise
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0214261_0214361 to this bill.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0217626_0217690 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023 considering we are not going to make a docking station docking.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0002698_0002756 I promise.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551 It's still small. It's time of day.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665 Start at 3 o'clock.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211 Yeah. Let me see.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450 for the last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004774_0004870 There he is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801 Okay, this is our last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236 In this meeting we will discuss our final design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073 We gaan er wat over te doen over het product, maar ook het project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473 And there we are going to move close to the project today as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027 So after this you'll be free to go and spend all your money.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951 Dit is een details design meeting. We zullen de beeld van de design discussieven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616 the usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053 In order to go to the Blue Zegena.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431 We will have the prototype presentation first.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847 Then we will set up some evaluation criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128 Then we will look at the finance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851 We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264 Everything costs money and the more fish you want to have the more money it will cost
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897 So we'll see if it fits within the 12 and a half euro per remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106 We will see that later.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608 Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797 We've got 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313 So we will be finished at half past three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458 the first
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059 people do the prototype presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536 to some, I think, even support.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033 But I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364 just a few buttons and large buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914 But I think these are all together. Quite a few buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558 I'm wondering if we really need all of those with us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0030283_0030338 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0034073_0034143 Right, good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567 I don't know, they're some subtitles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300 I had somebody but something about the design of the buttons there
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042770_0042859 It's nose.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583 I will move on to the finance part
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103 which is pretty exciting to see if it's possible what we're going to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313 And I can tell you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184 We're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12 and a half year.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093 if we see... I don't know if I've filled in correctly so just correct me if you see something wrong.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275 I got two batteries.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449 but maybe we can also use one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046688_0046778 That's which I would.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046778_0046829 uh
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569 It's two euros up.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771 Kita perlukan alfonsi
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964 Сария, одночельное.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445 Just say there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674 Here we have the single curve.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330 We kunnen zien dat de verschil tussen een kerk en een singel kerk is 1 euro.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0049567_0050630 Ik weet het niet, maar ik denk dat de single curve goed is voor de design en ook voor de display om een prominente plek op de remote control te hebben.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771 I think we have to keep it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207 Then we have the case material supplements.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051207_0051288 It's plastic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551 Det er det tæt, at vi ikke har det.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892 Dus dat is niet wat je doet in de safe, he?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253 But then the biggest cost are the patents.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124 So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our cost low.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846 because we have to get the 12 and half Euros at the end.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498 So, let's first count the buttons we have now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741 Go to level 16.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171 Now there will be even more of them.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282 18-0s.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363 Okay, including the health.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973 I think we can discard the help and the mute button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577 by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157 That saves us one zero already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347 Ik was daar meer dan 15, denk ik.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058911_0059003 And this is
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638 Ja też ja wam.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761 Yeah, but it's not stated in this. It's just, uh...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582 So maybe you can even make one button with the volume on the channel in one by pressing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189 That's possibility as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747 So and it's good for the design as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063747_0063844 so you can make
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253 Uh...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373 Make this
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283 Please, please, right there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604 Cross.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938 So
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067938_0067994 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755 I think they count the material.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434 I'm legit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069640_0069710 Uh...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069710_0069759 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476 Ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'n meddwl, ond rwy'
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612 Yeah, no, we don't think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110 maybe in the U.S. but then it seems to me that it's impossible to move with all of Europe.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807 Also the LC display. I think it's too expensive for the display we use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166 I think they tried.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535 That's right, but what's the biggest advantage of her remote being?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858 Take any number of bars.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075858_0075946 That's the extra.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075946_0075992 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577 It's an option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108 Please.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625 Felly, dwi'n credu bod yna'r unrhyw beth.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335 and integrate these buttons in three. Then save a lot of money as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0079648_0079729 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216 Yeah, but we have to stick to the 12 and all of you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758 We don't have any more budget.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085451_0085521 sales.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913 If you read all the series play.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188 And if you use less plattons
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824 Mae'r cantyw'r fath.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876 So
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0088391_0088466 Do I need to be a third person?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850 I think it's difficult, so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606 or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programming.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091774_0091815 It was.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155 Because that's not, we saved 10 letters.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604 So yeah. Five, four.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454 MBC 뉴스 김지경입니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956 Maybe you can
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416 scroll
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856 If you scroll you will see the number on the LCD display.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061 I'll tell you what the right number is and you push it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800 yn y cwylol yn cwysbwynt.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289 Okay, but then you can push some other breathing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097773_0097811 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288 Yn ymwneud yma, mae'r ffordd yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn y ffordd yn
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412 Mae'r gweld yn fawr yn fawr.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634 and we need better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440 and the regular chip is not possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541 That's the best one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028 I nie jeden, a co?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674 Now you can save a euro by a flat design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510 That's an option you can... Yep. Then we're almost there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103221_0103313 So if he
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097 Yeah, but I think that's a big advantage for us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780 Can we integrate the data text in the subtitles in one button?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035 That could be
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0110185_0111458 I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guy, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738 just make it real simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275 yw'r gwrs yn ymwneud.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622 and we can keep our LCD screen which can provide extra information
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798 how to use the sprawl wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097 I think that's the only drug that's been used as subtitles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870 En het is goed voor de inhoogtefdesign, dus wel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054 Keep with the raise.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936 É, é bonita.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0118202_0118283 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389 Something like that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627 And yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119627_0119725 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301 One, two, three, four, five. Let me see if we raise this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659 Dejam todas as notícias.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704 That's really a good idea, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742 And that will make the users of the scroll wheel more obvious in me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440 Felly, mae'r ffordd yn fwy o'r ffordd yn ymddiad.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540 So if you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127540_0127616 That's what I'm saying.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873 So we've got one, two, three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246 Yeah, we can leave the lyrics in if we want.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484 That's my job today.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0129528_0129580 So if you put
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130183_0130236 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130848_0130903 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131141_0131200 That's me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599 I'm pleased it's one of the two.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0132777_0132865 There you are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891 as more laws in which they are being made, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149 single currency is really easy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440 and cases coming right out of the machine.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932 single-curture, authentic, and just a machine that will help me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349 I think this is a really easy one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204 What does everybody think about a flap or a single curved design?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976 Yes, it does.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138075_0138134 Yeah, I know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138448_0138544 Danke.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061 We're doing some research.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867 but I think we can keep the single curve going.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423 just to express our LCD screen a bit more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234 Some people might use it more, especially for the health functions. It will be good if we have scroll bar, scroll button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583 We will be necessary to have good count function as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030 I think it was better to have this process a bit earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412 Yes, yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852 I'm glad we could make it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487 That's pretty different.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0146301_0146358 to get
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692 So we're going to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147824_0147921 Thank you the most.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713 Chasing en zo.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057 Maybe it's a... You can stick it out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709 Maybe that's recognizable for them as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882 It's a good book.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380 So I'm afraid this will go on.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789 And it's less frightening, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461 I think she is designing it. I think there are only five buildings.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0151710_0151804 Did you like what?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752 I would like.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182 I would buy a live ever since.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385 Nereli?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583 Bye to guys in the Fountain of Heroes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939 Yes, they are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590 but we can go with project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185 Okay, sit down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519 We still have 15 minutes left, so nice on schedule.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017 The project process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654 Valuation of the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0156703 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972 That was the thing, the point I forgot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157073_0157148 It should.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416 Dead end.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406 We hebben 5 minuten.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595 No, we've got 15 minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0159654_0159733 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0160899_0160939 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947 Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409 I tried to but it's giving errors but I didn't solve that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151 I think it's Vincent.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912 subtitles
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763 So we've got 20 cents for our docking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172007_0172054 It's
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577 It's a bit...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279 I would say four.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431 405.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173431_0173528 be tearful.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0174139_0174236 Is it functional?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410 I think it's seven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373 It was.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514 I have been worked out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276 They are okay, not very functional and getting lost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496 I think with a new radio button, I think it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180601_0180679 I think it's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0181167_0181228 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495 that we give this for.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543 then we also do it in three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657 and they want to put fashion in their products.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820 in de slogan van de company.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250 We have the removable phone cases.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526 So I think it's very recognizable.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302 We've got the camera.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159 We've got to be good on this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159 No, you can't do it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0191694_0191750 What do you want?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723 80%
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192723_0192769 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734 That's 84%.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531 I think it's a pretty nice score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196264_0196309 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091 that brings us to the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969 प्रज्ध प्रज्ध
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284 Did we move through the right places, you think?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0198284_0198384 long process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199215_0199260 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792 So lack of information about prices.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462 What's the room for creativity?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171 Because of the finance sheet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519 It's real must, yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092 Internet access.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292 was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819 Did it work out?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206819_0206916 working together.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281 Also, you do view with the... Yeah, it was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665 where the main is sufficient for the tasks that we had to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854 over the... too much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210536_0210617 What did we do?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227 if it wants to download this data.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719 SmartBoards.blogspot.com
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663 So you rather wanted to have a flip over.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862 or something like that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403 Foster was well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214952_0215006 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117 You need the smart port application I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463 Ik ben er.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606 That should be equal to...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760 Yeah, you can ask for this image.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036 Missed? Yeah, missed the evening.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673 So sharing of information was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141 Ja, ben je hier aan de 10?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0221553_0221616 possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383 We found new ideas for
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719 I think this kind of meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853 So everybody puts his own score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438 Yeah. It mediates the score and you can get one. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629 That's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773 So it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226902_0226980 How do you go?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875 Any more ideas?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035 questions about the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187 to our birth product.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027 Because I think...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842 Let's see. I got to our last shoot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225 Articles meeting the budget.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759 considering we are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184 at the local station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323 뭐예요?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942 That may be because of the docking station, the price of the remote can also be a little higher.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459 And I think you can composite that as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053 So I think that she will be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536 Do we think we're gonna get the $12.5 million?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728 How does it? Fifty.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002 Crescinho, crescinho de hoje.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226 I think we will.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421 Are you going to exploit this problem?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631 Ja. En over de...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796 Especially in America.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996 People are really thick of that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923 We've been here for the younger people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789 Just put it on the mic right away.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421 You can change markets by changing the front cover.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648 That's one thing you can change.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492 Dus je kunt ook proberen te reizen over de jonge mensen die je kan zien.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596 Just as a test.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780 See you, all of you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960 That's a good spot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889 I think we can have our little celebration right now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243008_0243104 It's party party.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641 I think we still have to put in more.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243641_0243727 I see.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243727_0243778 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907 I didn't get a message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644 ...from the... ...ending of the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766 Five more minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244766_0244857 That's good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441 Then we still have some questions.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777 If somebody has some questions, they can ask them now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188 We can put these projects for us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0246188_0246256 Mm-hmm.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137 Next four minutes. Picture nothing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996 This is another...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380 So that is the project cooler.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0251380_0251450 Okay then.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252084_0252182 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373 Yeah, that's a little bit of my little answer. That's OK.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073 I think I'm going to make our final presentation now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994 I will be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292 summary of the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455 I think you all get the Christian in your room.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867 And then I'll meet you in, I think, about 10 minutes first. Okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257911_0257969 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676 Ik hoop dat mijn panel erop is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258798_0258869 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520 Dat is gewoon de normaal remote controles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092 You push it, you came in page 100.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492 Je kunt de normale 120-buttons gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251 but you can also use the bedoam for changing the channel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597 So the shifting better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145 for shifting up on the text and shifting down
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0028020_0028081 May I just say?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0032664_0032723 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076 or you can build it when you press one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430 We just discussed that already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841 but we think all people don't know that option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336 So they just put in the best way they could.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0036106_0036142 Mm-hmm.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0038595_0038650 ...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039621_0039712 try that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870 just to recognize it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252 and we don't need a led or
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216 We moeten ook wat opzetten, maar we gebruiken de kleine display, we hebben het niet nodig.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989 Ja, ik kan je.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640 Go to the next one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055647_0055737 15.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074 Yeah, we did.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059797_0059890 I think there are two bones.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170 It's just one better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336 of it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809 So, for one big bill, I'm gonna...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278 but they are more expensive than the small ones.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922 It's just a...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814 But I don't know if it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508 We hebben nog 4 buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393 Ik had het niet bijna hetzelfde van die chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825 Cheers you've got, still for a better...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0070187_0070270 Yeah, but you could just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323 We can buy a remote control when you can use it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080323_0080403 So, um...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080795_0081905 Je moet stijden bij de 12.15.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675 is a total tool.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308 Het is mogelijk om een van de 1250 te maken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0085405_0085486 I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769 But I can't use...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698 Do you want to make a...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326 Fancy en goed.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709 I'm a bit worried about that though, it's a...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083 attractive options
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571 Dus je kunt onder 12.50 blijven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862 Let's go with this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091964_0092017 That's not it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0102171_0102209 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643 Of we moeten de subtitel van de sub-titel afbouwen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896 I think that's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203 Yeah, it's a big franchise.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445 But, um...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104854_0104924 好 平靜
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420 Maar als je de stijfjes met een strijd pusht.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106593_0106649 to say to you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180 That could be a few.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0130811_0130845 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737 Maar je kunt een grote rematocontrol maken voor hetzelfde prijs als een kleinste.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154 You only have to pay for the double curved or single curved
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380 Ja, het is een beetje...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0144166_0144215 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245 maar we weten de scrollbuttons van old radios
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690 En ook botten zoals dat voor een veranderd genoeg.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848 So, maybe it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341 That's very special, so...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0169428_0169515 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172293_0172354 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113 Well, if I would say...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379 405.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0174813_0174866 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045 There's that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054 That's a free.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961 We have to test it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151 Yeah, true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0183216_0183313 Thank you for your time.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0184600_0184659 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0198655_0198706 ...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034 I'm not sure if the person is here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998 But if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302 It's easier to share it with other people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688 So you can save it and put it on the internet
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321 or in shared folder or shared territory.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617 I'm gonna let it drop up now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571 It's kind of like an export it should be equal.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221557_0221619 possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0222830_0223899 Yeah, maybe just give the numbers of
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0224017_0225098 Het is makkelijk om dingen te doen zoals dat op de computer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564 So I just let like the university
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0232341_0232375 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0243410_0243496 Go to the station for me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498 I have to be f-
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875 Ah, maybe Dave will save it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252875_0252954 So it's
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986 Maybe you have to fill up another question here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256986_0257044 and
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471 That's new.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765 Sorry, I'm a little late.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891 it's stuck in the trash.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337 Is this the moment where we can ask questions about functionality?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526 When you're in teletext, there are usually buttons where you just press it and go to the next teletext page.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009 I think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127 That's what I pointed out earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580 You just make a control for just the TV. There's just not much to gain.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624 sensitively chargeable.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604 Wurden wir?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058664_0058737 It's easy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435 I assume you count the following on the channel things for two buttons each, right?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016 I think I think there are two buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891 Well, I'm thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402 That would cut the cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849 I think this review is for buttons anyhow
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689 under the docking station of this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247 Maybe we should move to a different spot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213 No, adesso non ho mai più
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340 Well, since the market research
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439 indicated that other people spend their money easier, more easily. Maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715 felly mae'r ffeithio'r cyfnodd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089659_0089691 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089831_0090913 basically become a choice between like either good remote and higher production costs or just no any other remote control
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017 but I would as school we will work here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447 they would bring up the price of the school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836 Rwy'n credu'n ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y ddweud y d
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096836_0096923 You
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523 I think that would be like the end of our usability.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0099189_0099267 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892 I think it's pretty much teletext subtitles are right now. You just push the teletext button go to page 888 and teletext disappears
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058 but sometimes they'll stay there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387 Dus, de hele tijd is vanwege het schrijf.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498 Dat kan gewoon worden.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376 But then again, there would be just pretty much an option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108535_0108604 Holding it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349 remote which they expect to have like 10 buttons for the numbers 1 to 0.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761 There's only five buttons on it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109976_0110054 And it's cool, dude.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143 That's pretty big school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621 So this is for every...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884 Right now we've...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803 Well, I still think we should go for the single curve design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008 Yeah, let me get him.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451 All these changes are not really okay with me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601 but since
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137769_0137865 I'll just have to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255 I don't know, just go to the board and...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782 Get us $18.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228 or do some research and see what the options are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362 It's pretty different.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959 This is not really like for the group you were making.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152 This will really require a lot of marketing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482 to get this to sell.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297 because older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426 This is not familiar.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830 So we're going to have to do a lot of convincing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151389_0151436 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580 It might be confusing to you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151720_0151805 to be like what?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906 I'll need five buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944 of a journal 60.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394 So I like set up all these criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642 evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736 Ddodd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865 Okay, so I did some literature study analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347 translated into criteria, which would be these.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584 Errm... ..ysrwm wrth ffansi.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756 Y shape looking feel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137 What new functions are there?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162137_0162232 easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741 Learnability is a very important factor here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952 is functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317 Are there not too many functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740 and those functions are already useful.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163740_0163825 And the cost?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164080_0164162 The target group.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617 is the remote really for the Cooper making it for?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998 yw'r rhai cyfnod.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536 If our company is, if it's easily recognizable, they're a company made it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081 So we're supposed to be evaluated right now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166423_0166471 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260 I have to say this wasn't doing hard because the minutes over last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0167371_0167425 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001 ..es i gweithio'r ffansi ond y sgiliau o'r rhan i'r sefydliadau.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635 The O'Village Sanctiqs.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392 There's a reason I'm in over to.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929 7 tijden of wat is dat?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030 Should we do that? Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181 as the design easy to use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172780_0172879 would be for us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0173579_0173666 I go for 14.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438 is the design functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714 Do we have all functions that we want to include?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174849_0174943 you think we do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151 Do we have too many functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175151_0175235 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175235_0175320 That's pretty sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990 No, then do we?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676 take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833 fel y gallwn gweld.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301 It was a rabbit for the dead one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0177301_0177351 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770 Yn ymgyrchun cyfnod, mae'n gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178770_0178849 We'll see you again.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698 doesn't design fit the group of focus.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180138_0180230 I think with a new
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180815_0180879 states.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181091_0181152 I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034 I think the video is not exactly what older people expect of remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0182989_0183036 I'm sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172 I think I'm going for a G.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632 Is it going to be the last day?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762 I was also supposed to calculate the score, but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353 We've got the camera.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785 Is this right after this?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100 I'm going to go ahead and say it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189254_0189335 Bye.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567 These are our sub-effectors, and seven is really good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356 I'm not sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964 three, two, one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191089_0191157 experience.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499 for maybe minus eight.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834 41.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134 I guess we'll just start with him.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171 So I can be here for you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145 I think we should have had the finance thingy a little earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442 in de design phase.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0201763_0201840 Not too much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202278_0202335 Yeah, true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157 And I would have liked to go for that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420 Younger users also.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833 and just be able to access internet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0204002_0204098 Get something here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573 I tried to open the file on my laptop but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217671_0217762 Not the way...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219000_0219096 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219812_0219863 Thanks for watching.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0232490_0232532 Thank you.
