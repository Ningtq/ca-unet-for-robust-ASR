AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0001232_0001522 So, show your hand and talk about it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003404_0003804 There you go.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0003804_0004372 Oh, I dropped mine as well. Good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0004372_0004550 You're just in the good stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0014258_0014411 Só dá, dá para o que?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0015240_0015280 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0019299_0019342 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0020774_0021798 I guess a button makes a bit more sense, because otherwise you don't really know that, oh, what if I right click now? What happens then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0021798_0022021 Well, no, you still have the show.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0022494_0022568 It's morning.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0023119_0023309 Like, if you want to add more things, I do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0028511_0029029 I don't know. I mean, it's part of the...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029176_0029382 crossing sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029382_0029782 More than this Picard third station as Steve mentioned.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0029782_0030242 Yeah, it's really how they're involved in speaking character. Yeah, it's really to be nice to have.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033387_0033423 Bye.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0033648_0034102 I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034102_0034749 Well, if you get to speak characterization, then someone talks a lot in a certain topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0034749_0035495 And then if you click on that topic you get everything that's in that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035495_0035633 I mean that's still another...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0035885_0035950 だらら
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0047186_0047257 Like we have ther-
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048370_0048684 Like, I don't show the speaker character, he's like, who else but that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0048684_0048784 Benz
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0049626_0050203 But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0050347_0050518 うそ、私で
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0052255_0052654 Yeah, do something, but... So it's your...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0053716_0053759 Oh
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054234_0054469 I'm guessing I put some... deep.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0054629_0054823 Yeah, once you're cooking up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0056192_0056252 single child
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0064834_0065636 But well, couldn't we? I mean, you probably, I don't know if you want to have like the full transcription and the summary at the same time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0065756_0066343 So maybe you can just choose the same window for transcription and summary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066792_0066942 That's a nice.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0066942_0067089 Ja, das geht sehr bestachig.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067488_0067598 Did we not have the dec-
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0067598_0067821 Can you do that job? I don't think so.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069530_0069723 or just, I don't know, but
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0069723_0070329 Yeah, that might be changed to contents of the same window. Yeah, yeah. Like a transcription to summary.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0070453_0070496 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071598_0071661 Why don't we?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071661_0071729 we can do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0071903_0072556 No, no, it could be like a transcription summary. You just press on one or two.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0073967_0074082 Oh, my God, for me!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0075387_0075484 any other specific
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0077778_0077821 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079078_0079370 Yeah, well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079370_0079997 But transcripts sounds reasonable to have transcripts like maybe three alzernes then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0079997_0080387 like full meeting, meeting without discrepancies and summaries.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0081037_0081143 Mm.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084663_0084719 Pagacélettes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0084719_0085603 I mean, just to try and... I mean, for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing. Yeah, that's what we need to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086073_0086473 Just so see the integration works. So, it's really there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0086888_0087101 Sólo que está todo bien en el tiempo.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088004_0088628 Well, I guess, I mean, that was probably our intention but we might not have written it down.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0088628_0088867 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0094981_0095082 Let's see that again. Oh, for a...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0097561_0097613 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099449_0099697 Can I tell you what, I'm an SBT.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0099998_0100130 So, um, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0100130_0101160 I basically started browsing a bit, just trying to see if there's anything out there to use.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101288_0101585 I'll be sure to keep it like this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101585_0101685 Inverted file storage.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101685_0101792 Damn it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0101792_0102458 Okay, found a tutorial but it was searched indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103281_0103473 Yeah, well, I don't know if it's Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103473_0103608 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0103608_0104072 But I found some code for like from a tutorial about indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104072_0104133 Come on, come on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0104458_0104529 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0105467_0105681 blue.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106017_0106053 I don't know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106053_0106854 I was a bit worried about when he talked about this with the file.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0106854_0107249 I mean, how much do we actually need to do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0107249_0107771 like extracting things from the XML files and stuff to be able to do the indexing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110119_0110483 Are you ready in Java?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0110616_0110841 I mean you should have had the look, have a look at the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0113394_0114347 Um, yeah, I guess, I mean, it was a good point they had that like collaborating with Foul things
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0114347_0114848 I mean if you are a historian, we can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115519_0115636 Should we, um...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115829_0115980 meet up and see what we get.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0115980_0116747 I mean, I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need, when we know more.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0116747_0116842 weeks and yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0121416_0121534 It started attacking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0122521_0122604 Je vais pas se faire.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128171_0128615 But what if I said like a window where you have to write the search query?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128615_0128800 Oh, is it just what's behind it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0128800_0129035 No, this is not the actual
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0129035_0129151 such this is just
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0134560_0135831 When you like, is there a open thingy or what did you do to like, how did you figure out that it's used in the search? Um, is it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144448_0144493 Hmm
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0144867_0144899 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0149397_0149437 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0152324_0152410 which
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0155807_0156044 This pic, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0156411_0156771 Happy happy way to discuss it so much.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0157437_0157493 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0159344_0159439 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0163914_0163954 I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166080_0166148 Moons.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0166778_0167381 The progress report is June 23rd.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0167730_0167888 아
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0169920_0170266 Just looking at my old deadlines.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0170294_0170594 I'm...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0172494_0172917 Wasn't like what do you have now? Isn't that pretty much the key to it? No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0172917_0173184 Oh, that's that's so
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0173910_0174620 Nice you've done the room it! It's fucking messy actually! It's actually all these things that are mixed.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175509_0175587 Boom.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175691_0175770 I know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175770_0175999 I'm a fan.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0175999_0176266 It's so much fun.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0179871_0180527 It would be nice to meet up and you can show us the video already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0180527_0180987 so we don't have to do all the work again, just figuring out stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0181391_0181684 Just like accessing the corpus and stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0185851_0185928 네
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0186513_0186630 Uh
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0187051_0187192 Sex? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0188834_0188902 It's for...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0190341_0190431 I see some of
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0190431_0190658 That's a very good one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0191051_0191105 front door.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0191630_0191708 this computer
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0192242_0192775 I'll let us all in there and we can look on in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193805_0193935 Into what? The computer world.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0193935_0194028 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0195765_0196060 I need to get a photocopier assignment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0196589_0196765 So what time do we say?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197137_0197220 Afternoon.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0197331_0197709 ありがとうございます
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199088_0199348 Eee... Mówi, to jest...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199474_0199554 Sounds like
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199554_0199647 Митя!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0199647_0200193 Should we really? Well, it's supposed to be next week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200193_0200308 Tweaking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200554_0200596 Hello?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0200596_0201020 We have one class at least, when we have speech perception we don't have any lectures.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201020_0201252 But I think I'm like all out of classes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0201252_0201545 Yeah, I don't think there was a point there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202017_0202078 I'll see you in a minute.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202348_0202617 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0202617_0203004 I think the other word is had a word of...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204224_0204578 Yeah, we will probably.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0204578_0204860 Last week. Okay?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205048_0205523 Yeah, I guess that's it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205523_0205676 Was there anything else?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0205676_0206048 Do you want one? Like, take care of yourself. Should I take care of it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206263_0206578 I don't know if it was so good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206578_0206731 I think it basically said
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0206959_0207489 I'm the same thing as in the comments if I could use it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0207601_0208075 You see that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0208880_0209062 We'll see you in color.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0209487_0209690 Oh, that was him. Yeah, I think...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210783_0210862 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0210996_0211532 7%?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211532_0211708 It's okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211708_0211786 Panie Wility!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0211914_0212391 You're okay with having sex?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213391_0213503 Third time now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213503_0213747 으흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐흐�
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0213928_0214081 Is she still here?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO070_0214081_0214159 Thanks for watching!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0000358_0000538 Yes!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001320_0001372 to me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0001521_0002417 Once you just go around and everyone says what they've been doing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0002417_0002522 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003057_0003385 Well I've got a browser now, which, whoops.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0003385_0003440 Ainda
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005038_0005142 So yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005142_0005935 We've got a browser which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0005935_0006681 And then when you go on the menu, you can select a summarization box which pops up and an audio player.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0006879_0007304 And I think the search works as well, so you can pop up a search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007304_0007975 and it loads up just the background window so empty and so when you start
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0007975_0008475 You have to either open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008648_0008707 That makes sense.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0008861_0009603 The transcription box has got a summarised button which doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0009603_0010391 Now, I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up window with the speaker characterisation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010620_0010958 Either we could do that, you know, when does the pop-up come?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0010958_0011582 either we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0011582_0012313 Or we can put an extra button, extra few buttons next to the summarised button so that you are actually in the transcription box.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012838 But so you click on a button and then it opens and whatever that speaker characterization is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0012838_0013481 The problem is the left click is already used because it highlights that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0013662_0014263 that part of speech or whatever that what he's saying the left click the left click I like it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014263_0014755 so that you can... I don't know what happens when you don't work like actually.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0014755_0015291 That would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015291_0015579 I think so yeah when you left click it
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0015579_0016074 you can for example set the marker there so that the audio goes from there I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016268_0016434 So we can't put it on left again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016434_0016638 We could put it on a right click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0016638_0016875 Wicked, for example, have a little menu that pops up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0017064_0017669 So right click on it menu and you can click on speak for characterization.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018003_0018170 That's a good point.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018170_0018296 Hmm
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018296_0018364 Otherwise
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0018512_0019136 Yeah, but I don't know about you, but usually in Windows, right-click doesn't do anything, does it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019136_0019281 It opens a menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019281_0019509 Ja, dat zal ik ook niet meer doen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019509_0019685 a bit weird for it to just not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0019685_0019789 bring that stuff in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0020464_0020661 Or just, you know, or just the button.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0021828_0022161 Well no, you still have the menu. The menus pop up there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022303_0022415 Well, oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022415_0022683 It's more obvious, isn't it? It's more idiot-proof, isn't it? It's got-
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022781_0022916 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0022916_0023124 That's true, yeah. More than cheers.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0023440_0023676 It's not even worse than your type things.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0024560_0025014 This one in the middle.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0025014_0026007 But actually what we could do is in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026135_0026438 I search for that user.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0026438_0026635 Is that gonna be useful or too much?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0027270_0027918 Yeah, so when you right click on it, one option will be give me all your meetings. Characterise a speaker.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0028408_0028527 Was that too much? I mean...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0029777_0029908 Yeah, it's true, you know, hot.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030101_0030163 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0030163_0030404 It would be nice to have ink and ink and ink.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031661_0031855 What do you mean by those bigger characterizations?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0031855_0031976 Oh well, yeah I mean.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032138_0032239 ありのばな
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032239_0032507 I mean, the speaker characterisation is a bit like he said.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032507_0032731 I mean, it's like a nice thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0032731_0033237 We don't know, I'm not actually sure what the user wants for it but it's interesting so why not give it to him?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033408_0033513 I think we should do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0033513_0033555 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035475_0035713 Yeah, I mean that's still another level further.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035713_0035849 I mean we're not even there yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0035849_0036132 No, no, no, it doesn't pop up the speaker character section yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036132_0036419 We have to first define what happens when you click on the user.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0036933_0037201 So shall we try to do a right click when you're done?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0038786_0039120 Yeah, there's a second thing about the topics the topic window
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039120_0039859 you want to somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that right
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0039955_0040278 So we could do that in a similar way, do it right away as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040278_0040500 So this is for...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0040963_0041128 So, yeah, this is it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0041128_0042077 So we have basically two options of browsing the meetings is by either searching and opening individual observations.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0042077_0042413 and then we have the interlinking by right click.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0043540_0043601 Ta bofek.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0046279_0046699 I didn't say there was anything obvious that would be able to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0048635_0049016 But then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0049016_0049385 And they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050231_0050320 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0050661_0051319 Stop coming up. I'll let me close it. It's nothing to the world. Especially if you're already touched by it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051319_0051763 There you are.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0051763_0052198 I'll check what it does on double click at the moment.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052198_0052354 Because I think he would do something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0052354_0053059 But I don't really see anything obvious.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0053232_0053373 I mean, if you can think of something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0054942_0055367 Um, yeah nothing...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055367_0055554 Single audio files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0055554_0055657 To je vone je zemro.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056175_0056388 Yeah, single channel, then single channel files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056388_0056482 So we want them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056482_0056539 Amen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0056935_0057083 どうやってやってる?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0057083_0057836 We might use them at the moment to work with them, but do we want to integrate them so that when you browse you can...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058138_0058175 Do you think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058175_0058529 No, he's not gonna make much sense if you listen to it on its own, do you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0058529_0058566 less
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0059290_0059432 Bye.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061004_0061410 Yeah, what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that you've mentioned?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061410_0061622 Do you think? I think we're calling him.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0061802_0062025 already? We need to have a... That's why. That's all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0062025_0062566 I mean I remember very much I don't want to have everything customisable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063100_0063186 ピンアップ
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063271_0063546 Two, three minutes.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063546_0063967 But yeah, it depends. I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere, you know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0063967_0064139 And the summary, for example, is typically
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064139_0064653 you open the window, you re-throw it, you might close it again straight away.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0064653_0064783 Baby, good job, baby!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0066465_0066707 First mass, about 15 seconds.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067015_0067093 We're doing this now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067093_0067298 Yeah!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067298_0067356 That's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067356_0067509 And that's all, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067774_0067816 Bye!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0067816_0068028 I don't think that really, maybe he probably can't.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068028_0068145 I'm sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0068145_0068259 Je vais quitter anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069193_0069280 I can have a look.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0069694_0069876 But yeah, that might be...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074042_0074793 I don't mean people get used to it, I mean when you use windows or the next floor, you have a lot of windows open.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0074793_0074870 Thanks for watching!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075637_0075770 Yeah, you can at least.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0075770_0075825 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0076972_0077180 Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that's what they... Yeah, that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077312_0077525 Yeah, they're definitely gonna be in the same one. I'm probably in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0077961_0078225 Yeah, that was a plan for the dyspensies anyway.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078225_0078273 So
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078405_0078674 Yeah, do you want to do that with some reason?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0078674_0078914 Put the souries in the same way now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0079024_0079145 me sure he is going to say something
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0080411_0080636 Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to do that? Which one makes sense. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0081658_0082025 and finally the prototype he spoke about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082025_0082238 What kind of prototype could be produced?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082427_0082876 Because I'm just going to the lab and I'm like what am I going to change today?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082876_0082966 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0082966_0083521 Any kind of just, it just develops. I'm not aiming for anything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0083521_0083648 Do we want to eat some something?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084151_0084417 I'm pretty much getting there anyway, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0084417_0084676 So, it's not been being a lot for me, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0086512_0086575 Check.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0087635_0087724 That was...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090041_0090334 Like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0090334_0090526 I don't know if you can access the people that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091245_0091452 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0091452_0091735 I don't know if it's readable at the moment but you can show me how. I don't like it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092632_0092884 Right, well I'll make that readable then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0092884_0093251 So the directory is my number.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093469_0093781 Well this is not too bad. We'll see you later.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093781_0093953 In all the emails.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0093953_0094325 Dios no va
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094325_0094677 okay A4 5.75
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0094852_0094906 Six-Hand
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095076_0095254 May 4th, 555, assist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095493_0095832 And then there's a folder in LSSD.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0095954_0096182 and it's called the M-Rouser.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0096372_0096633 For me?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097137_0097408 あははははは
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097408_0097519 I've got a cold, sir.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0097519_0097586 I love you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098653_0098772 Yeah, so that's me done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0098772_0098929 Someone else might don't believe that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101141_0101294 おおいでみて
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0101518_0101603 Awesome!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103010_0103097 It's like, okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103097_0103239 I found some clothes for it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0103796_0103892 of Mokka Tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0104071_0104139 Come on, cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105314_0105391 Y ahora, ¿sabes?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0105647_0105801 So you think it shouldn't be too difficult.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107796_0107929 Oh, I see.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0107984_0108254 Ich wollte kein weiterhäten zum Sohn vor.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0110673_0111508 I mean, you should have a look at the browser code then because, you know, they're already extract, for example, transcripts. Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0111508_0111638 I'm sure I do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117526_0117565 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0117565_0117771 This week's only two days old!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119772_0119940 Okay, okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0119940_0120083 It wasn't what it was.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0120083_0120184 Sente-se.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122509_0122961 Well, the browsers are used now or as...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0122961_0124017 It was there when I took it. It uses the NXT search to get the data out of the files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124017_0124283 Which I think is odd, but I'm not quite sure how it works yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124283_0124371 I'm doing quite a sum.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0124736_0125544 To get the data, for example, to get summarisation data, you have to search for, I think, the IDs on something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0126372_0126907 So they don't say, look in that and that folder, but they search everything.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127599_0127915 It does not have quite grip.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0127915_0128090 Is that you? I'm not so mad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128090_0128300 But, you know, what, what, I said like...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0128916_0129092 No, this is not the actual search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129092_0129792 This is just when you open, you know, to load the transcript, for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0129792_0130668 It does an XC search for the string, I don't know, transcript or text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0131325_0132073 Yeah, so I don't know if you've looked at the search query language but it's like $1.00 a text.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132517_0132635 And then, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0132635_0133008 Because every year all of these...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133146_0133367 These files have got an ID.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133367_0133778 and all the transcript files got the string. I don't know what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0133778_0134161 words or text or something in it. So just search this for those files.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0135749_0136115 Um, is it? Um, well, it's in the code.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136115_0136646 Just that you define a search object and then search that string.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136646_0136971 I had to figure out how to do the same thing for the summer.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0136971_0137045 That's not right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137199_0137656 How they did the transcript to do the song.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0137932_0138302 Yeah, just search for specific strings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0138539_0139209 So you could just use that if you want to take the data out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0139668_0140326 If you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want to...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140326_0140557 you know, whatever you want to do, then just send me an email.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0140684_0140767 Eye care explain
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141071_0141221 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141221_0141861 Actually in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the the browsers that are used from this from you know
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0141861_0142167 that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142167_0142569 and have a day at throwing out all the functions I have.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142569_0142648 てるし
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0142891_0143171 So they're really annoying still.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143171_0143597 a lot of rubbish but we'll be chucked out right at the end I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0143975_0144143 Yeah, I can't get rid of that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145448_0145854 First thing down, the rest of that is a little in the show.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0145854_0146061 The weekend is still four days off.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0146751_0146953 I don't actually have that much.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0147125_0147573 to explore any other.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148033_0148494 I can't remember what I'm supposed to do, man.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0148494_0148752 Am I supposed to do the summarization thing about?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0149932_0150211 You do. I don't know. You saw it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150211_0150300 Well, I'll do that then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150440_0150541 Bye!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150541_0150591 Huh?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0150701_0150793 ¡Oh! Bien, este es un...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151237_0151324 Eşim mi içedi?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0151324_0151360 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152113_0152802 Although I'm doing communications, which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0152802_0153029 That's in two weeks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153288_0153740 Yeah, it's a... I would play digital. 9, 9, 10, something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0153901_0154781 And then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well and that seemed like Friday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155035_0155705 Well I'm not doing any bad hand-picking so...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0155705_0155763 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159233_0159403 Yeah, if you like.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159403_0159664 We can decide.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0159741_0159994 So what are you planning to do over the weekend then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160140_0160327 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0160327_0160522 I'm like, I'm in the center.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0163891_0164297 I think we need to set ourselves some milestones if it's otherwise.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164485_0164537 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0164782_0164907 It's a behind schedule.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0166146_0166411 Or you decide I'm not doing much for my president.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0167893_0168151 Well, how about we get done by then?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168151_0168188 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0168444_0168972 Then we can write about it in the interim report. Yes. Now we've got something to show.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0170421_0170824 I want the search interface.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171085_0171814 Maybe you should decide pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0171814_0172395 And then if you want you can give that to me now. I'll build you nice, you know, a few dick boxes and drop down menus.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173031_0173365 Oh that's... that's so... that doesn't exist.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173365_0173753 That's completely cut and pasted.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173753_0173939 and it's not existent
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0173939_0174331 Nicely done, the room is. Yeah, it's quite impressive, it's neat.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0174331_0175377 Because actually all these things are nicks from, you know, all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicks from Google.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175377_0175487 screenshot Google.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0175679_0176358 I know! I remember! That's got so much fun!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176358_0176565 It's gonna be a little bit more difficult.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0176565_0177317 Yeah I mean I was going to but you know the whole drop down menus and stuff what we want to search for is not quite agreed on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177317_0177653 I never agreed on what we were gonna be able to search for.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0177980_0178441 Yeah, do you want to, you know, just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0178441_0178929 and then we could discuss at next meeting which options we really want to include.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0179135_0179603 I would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0181211_0181306 No already? Well...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183053_0183130 Yes, on a vu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0183247_0183443 Show you the code.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0184062_0184390 Oh yeah!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0184390_0184885 What is some eye and the exact same thing?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0185631_0185865 Yeah, I was about to say an hour ago.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0185987_0186047 something like that
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186274_0186440 Pick a time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186440_0186706 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0186866_0187030 Bop, Monday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0187030_0187079 I'm gonna say
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188099_0188231 3 o'clock?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188231_0188316 A się... nie.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0188886_0189228 Oh, that's an option.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0189327_0189368 Dr. J
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0190375_0190467 Nice to serve.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0191393_0191513 We can get in through there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0191862_0191980 I'm not fan of that yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0195773_0195858 お前はフフフッ
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196080_0196423 Oui, moi aussi.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196423_0196524 Well the comments I think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196807_0196960 I just think it's better to do afterwards.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0196960_0197135 So we have all the time. Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0197135_0197413 So after the last...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198623_0198860 Actually it's not even confirmed yet.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0198860_0199278 What? She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199278_0199452 Maybe it doesn't happen at all.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0199758_0199815 Is it really?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200409_0200538 I don't think we have a reading week now.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0200538_0200603 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0201280_0201698 I don't think there was an official one last semester
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0201698_0201870 I think it was just a back hold, wasn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0204855_0204937 Zmij mamy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0211713_0211898 So maybe you could be the other team boss, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_FEO072_0213148_0213262 슈트네상도 나고
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0000037_0000174 I wonder how much of the music
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0000540_0000872 いやいや、これ、したわ
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0001498_0001562 தெரியும் அழைத்து
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0001907_0002369 ¿Se puede taler en ti? No, no.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0002779_0002990 Yeah, it's time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0004152_0004342 Get out of there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0010638_0010662 Bye.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0013878_0014055 to the left.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0016945_0017081 Yeah, I'm gonna get this one as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0017692_0017968 What else can we have in there?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0018302_0018699 Otherwise you just had a right click on the video.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019008_0019065 Te sepulche
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019231_0019324 I'm in the air.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019324_0019405 Ja, das war meine Bühne.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0019405_0019811 Mae'r ddweud yn ddweud yn ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i ddweud i d
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022078_0022149 Let's hop up there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022508_0022651 It's more idiot proof, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0022651_0023204 Let's go about it. Yeah, yeah. That's true. More and more. Let's smell this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0023462_0023539 That would be worse.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0023928_0024337 Well, I guess in Meeting Browser 1.1.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0024337_0025195 You can have a menu instead of a bar. But this one, dude. But actually, what we have to do is...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0026762_0026807 I guess I...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0026807_0027289 So what did you, part of the menu that comes down is says give me all your meetings.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028606_0028670 알겠어요
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028670_0028789 3위
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0028789_0028885 It's being looked at.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0033274_0033321 ねえ
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0035954_0035986 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0036443_0036813 with the speaker characterisation for this middle-week crossing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0036813_0037031 So should we try it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0037598_0037628 Well...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0037812_0037941 Even if I just want to start from the knee.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0040143_0040498 So this is for...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0040691_0040809 on the speaker.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0041033_0041181 Yeah, this is what it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0046952_0047016 What was that?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0047016_0047116 I think I understand
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0047116_0047168 Demain
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0047821_0048342 I would say it will be a choice. It's the most common use for double P.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0050456_0050574 嘘たちで
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0050574_0050717 I'll go away!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0050717_0050901 Stop having a hug and then close it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0051364_0051484 There he is!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0051484_0051863 Oh wait! I'll check with...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0055863_0056045 Me he dado una idea de que me voy a hacer de ti.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0056045_0056157 de mim, sem gostar.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0056580_0057088 Probably not, but we might need them for the fluency. If we try to do it in order.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057088_0057255 But we might use them at the moment, no.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057255_0057500 to work with them back do we want it into
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0057791_0058099 You might want to be able to say, oh, just give me what that person's saying.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058505_0058736 Unless you can't hear it properly or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058736_0058939 talking over somebody else or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0058939_0058979 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0059095_0059365 Would you say no for now and put it in, mate?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0059365_0059398 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0059679_0060216 Yeah, because otherwise they will increase the amount that they do not want to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0060216_0060330 До шубы!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0064717_0064841 I think it's fine.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0064862_0064969 뭐 그런거야
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0066914_0066991 Evet, tamam, hadi.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0066991_0067105 Sehr lustig.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067517_0067620 Nobody knows how to do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067620_0067699 안녕
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067699_0067902 I don't think 12 and nice ought to be that pretty.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0067902_0068026 Maybe, maybe you probably can't.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068026_0068178 I'm sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068294_0068404 He really knew what he did.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068404_0068460 Anladın mı?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068460_0068785 It's a bit of a cripple job as we're doing toolkit.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0068785_0069057 The eight isn't sometimes a bit of a cripple.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0070178_0070244 네
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0072615_0073007 That would have reached the number of windows needed, wouldn't it?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073007_0073095 Cheers for you!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073095_0073445 Tell my friends, Photoshop has a lot of windows. If you ever use Photoshop, it's got loads.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0073445_0073665 and you'll always get forever going, I'll get out of the way.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0075888_0076047 I have a slug here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0076088_0076284 Of course you can.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0085470_0085653 Yes, that's what we needed.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0085653_0085983 Something just slightly more than just that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0086536_0086642 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0087094_0087314 I think that's kind of what he meant as well, isn't it?

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0090504_0090785 You can make it world readable than anybody can.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0091683_0091941 I think by default they aren't. No, they're not world readable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0091941_0092409 They don't need to feel, they only you can make them laugh.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0092409_0092544 You can see them but you can't read.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0093642_0093761 곧 시원한다?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0094000_0094135 Dios no va

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096253_0096476 The end browser for reading.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096603_0096861 I hope you never have to look in my direction.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096861_0096996 It's just pure chaos.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0096996_0098011 I've got balls on me, I love balls. Mine is serious, can I ask?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0098011_0098236 Father with

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0101383_0101731 All the searching for the podcast, and pretty file stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0103100_0103274 We found some code for it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0103274_0103343 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104086_0104146 Come on, cool.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104146_0104463 So even if it doesn't work you can jigglypock it around and make it around.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104463_0104502 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0104833_0104923 Yeah, messing around.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0108343_0108907 I've been trying to write something to read the XML and get rid of it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0108907_0109230 And I can get rid of it, but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0109230_0110041 So it'll come up on the screen. At the moment I haven't managed to put it into a back door whatever in jargon.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0110041_0110272 But, I'm gonna have a really good one.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0110272_0110361 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0111440_0111661 Yeah, I'm sure they do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112175_0112406 Oh yeah, I will.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112406_0112504 Sir, something is...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0112504_0113049 I'm sure I'm making a male of it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114572_0114667 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0114667_0114752 Да, все это и есть.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0116852_0117355 So you're still... Actually, I haven't done anything this week because this week's been mad.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0117355_0118027 Yes, exactly. I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whenever it was last week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118027_0118367 The week as is rather than the proper week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118367_0118669 and it's been a long day of manic the last one
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0118821_0118966 Det er det som det har for smag.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125768_0125866 I guess it's not worse.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125951 고
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0126161_0126273 That is what Braves are.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0127051_0127129 Nice break, sir.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0130698_0131380 4 and it just has an open variable, transport, whatever, find everything that's got that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0132084_0132683 Yeah, yeah, because that's the guy who declares a variable, doesn't he? And then, yeah, because...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137198_0137323 Oh, see, I'm...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0137664_0137928 So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it? It's all we did.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0139133_0139328 5'leden sonra asistin kimliği ver.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0140885_0141114 If you're gonna taste it, you're code. Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0141114_0141347 Actually in the moment it's gone
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142482_0142647 This is okay for the dance.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0142647_0142936 It's very practical.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0143627_0144045 Can we take it out one bit at a time?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0144045_0144630 Okay, go to that next.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0144630_0144709 Okay, sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0145209_0145714 So basically we're going to kind of do some work. Yeah, that's true. See you then. See you all next time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0145714_0145806 They're looking to show up there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0146177_0146599 Still in the pub with the mountains!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0146991_0148409 Well, should you finally want to explore any other? Yeah, it's really exciting. How's your, um, Contamara raising? I can't respond.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0150042_0150192 二層へへへへ
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0151690_0152141 Felly, wrth gwrs, yw'n ddweud bod yn fwy o'r ddweud yn ymgyrch.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0153784_0153900 Ah, it says it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0156158_0156528 I'll be happy when this week is over.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0174055_0174256 Yes, this is quite messy, really.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0175667_0176204 Give it a try.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0177660_0177739 Nice, nice.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0182306_0182820 You can take a search tutorial, see how important it is. You know the class paths, all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0183594_0183865 Next week's answer will be...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0187312_0187486 Not yesterday.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188355_0188627 The reason why
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188627_0188749 It was one time still, and I'll do it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0188749_0188825 for the
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189592_0189678 Trace get there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189678_0189903 But we have a good thought.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0189903_0190011 Bon, c'est bon que je fasse.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0190469_0191133 330 in the computer room in here. I'm a truly just house kid in there though. Can't he get in the front door?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191133_0191290 I haven't got a key, do you?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191290_0191374 Can I have your gay?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0191580_0192089 This computer room's in here, the MSC computer. Not found that yet. Have a free take on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192089_0192700 Well if you find me I'll show you where our letters all in there and we can look at them.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192700_0192791 謝謝
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192791_0192913 You do need to have a keeper.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192913_0192972 I just think
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0192972_0193082 It's going to knock the whole back.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0193221_0193326 Yeah, somebody asked.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194037_0194480 It's only got this crap, it's only got about four or five convetes in it, but it would do quite good for my job.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194480_0194796 because it can also be very abnormal in the painting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0194976_0195055 Yes, fiction.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195055_0195472 And there's a fight stop here with the code on it, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0195472_0195877 Es que voy a ir por el camino.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197101_0197132 out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0197316_0197367 你
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0198132_0198470 Hopefully it's not that man's, it won't matter.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202080_0202399 Some classes didn't, some classes didn't.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202399_0202522 It feels weird already.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0202522_0202670 very funny, I know what was going on.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0203437_0203591 Yeah, making what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0206074_0206171 Oh, wait, trust me.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212600_0212704 Signing off then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE071_0212704_0212767 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0000096_0000665 I wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff the meetings. Yes!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002147_0002311 No, what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0002707_0002820 Sounds like you've done something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0019845_0020242 to just answer the same sort of idiom throughout.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023050_0023188 Let us know if it's helpful.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023188_0023463 Like, if you want to add more things in the future, well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023492_0023804 But where's the menu? I think it's more flexible.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0023804_0024042 Well, I guess
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024287_0024381 What can you do?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024381_0024516 No me encendí de verlo.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0024516_0024746 Je vais te faire un petit tour
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030336_0030633 Yeah, they're maybe tired of doing with dialogue acts or something as well.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030633_0030899 I mean, speaker characterization. I didn't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0030899_0031139 Just some way to sort of leverage that information.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031139_0031547 Like we have it, we're doing it the way how just to help the browsing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0031547_0031789 Or what can you give us?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0036844_0036914 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037629_0037844 That's that just from the main?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0037844_0038530 Is that from any particular window? Like if we want to sort of get... Like if we're on the users versus like a topic or something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0038530_0038786 Have a light on the front for these very soon.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0039767_0039903 Right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040228_0040305 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040426_0040582 C'est central.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0040582_0040671 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042611_0042816 Actually, yeah, like another common thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0042816_0043260 like if we have it so set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043260_0043622 I mean that's kind of a typical common action. Double-fig.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0043622_0044106 If you don't click on a particular topic or something that goes to sort of like a default view
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044106_0044434 So it will be like all the cases of that topic.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044434_0044882 either whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0044882_0045291 and just walk the particular instances of that topic in the middle.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045291_0045449 Like I just think to have the default there's
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045449_0045889 So if somebody knows exactly what they want to do and we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0045889_0046271 So the door click will do that, and just save from the trouble of right clicking and choosing the other one menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0046605_0046933 Well, you might come to us and start playing with it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047144_0047355 Like we have the right click menu.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047355_0047814 Yeah, right click but instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0047814_0048253 Oh, it will be a trick. It's the most common use.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050686_0050787 Still coming
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050787_0050871 Oh, then they close it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0050901_0051245 Yeah, it's not good. It's not good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0056935_0057122 Don't I tell you I don't?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0061525_0062063 Think we probably need that though depth of the full flexibility we need to have
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0062635_0063079 Well, the thing is typically, though, is someone going to have five windows open at the same time, probably not.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0063079_0063650 Probably not, no. Two or three of whatever. Two or three maybe.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0064658_0064727 Maybe good to
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066363_0066473 So like have a time there?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0066473_0066660 Christmas.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0067707_0067992 I don't think to have an eyesore to do that, really.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0070776_0071251 Yeah, or you can just have buttons on it, toggle buttons or something on the toolbar of that window.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071444_0071496 So,
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071604_0071899 Well, I definitely think we can do it. It doesn't have to be a tab or whatever.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0071899_0072058 No, no, it could be like...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072507_0072576 for checkmarks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0072576_0072925 that would reduce the number of windows.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0073677_0073785 Oui, c'est ta fenouette.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0075628_0075840 Yeah, you can, at least. Can you do that? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076219_0076581 Like a lot of these can be, like once we get the dysfluences out then we can.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0076581_0077006 of transcript with all the dysphoency transcript with the different disciplines.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077006_0077098 Собол висни
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077098_0077878 How about these sort of using the same window until we can go far? Yeah, they're definitely going to be in the same one. And probably mutually, um, just, just good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0077878_0077947 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0080447_0080587 Yeah. You want to know that? That would make sense.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082308_0082395 in February.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0082870_0083007 And it comes out.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0085854_0085988 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089197_0089641 Actually, just the code accessible, like the GUI stuff that you've done there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0089641_0090010 Like can we just copy the latest stuff out of your directory?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090010_0090601 Like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something try to explain something.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0090732_0091278 But if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable then we know the directory to get in. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091362_0091506 I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0091705_0091985 I think by default they aren't. No, they're not world readable.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0092565_0092653 Okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093261_0093398 Great to just unveil to us.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093398_0093531 Okay, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0093531_0093627 挺好
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0096404_0096606 We're leaving.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101290_0101489 I'll be searching for it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0101489_0101940 every file stuff the next search query number.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102357_0102731 So you could probably just use that code like that was behind the question chance to me.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0102731_0103149 And the reusing code and stuff was just like, okay.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0103286_0103406 Yeah, well, I don't...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104422_0104524 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104524_0104872 We'll probably self-do some other file management, I'm not quite sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0104872_0105003 Messing around, so this is it, this is it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0111840_0111900 Monscreen
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0115078_0115204 Mm-hmm libraries
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0116848_0117033 Thanks!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117033_0117172 So you're still...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117172_0117196 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117363_0117533 Yes, exactly.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0117533_0118031 I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whatever it was last week. Oh, last week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118578_0118835 What? Well, you're an SPNLP NSP too, right?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118835_0118904 That's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0118904_0118986 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0119724_0119772 Дярую!
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120585_0120701 Okay, that's fun.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0120932_0120956 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121271_0121856 Yeah, I was thinking the weekend probably. That started attacking this seriously.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0121856_0122358 Hopefully I'll have something by next week that we can sort of integrate into the good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0122504_0122604 We must show the past for...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127378_0127795 Well they didn't say it wasn't the most efficient.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0127795_0128003 I got quite creepy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0142505_0142623 Okay, forget this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0144017_0144115 Poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-poo-
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145397_0145576 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0145873_0145886 you
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146004_0146201 Yeah
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0146304_0146826 Still in the bottom of the mountain. How many hours is this?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0147120_0147459 to explore any other.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0148212_0148293 Ha ha ha ha ha
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149554_0149614 Who was doing?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0149880_0150007 You do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150178_0150270 Well, I'll do that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150288_0150408 This can be changed.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150408_0150546 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150546_0150752 I don't know, it doesn't matter.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150752_0150839 if you want to.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0150839_0151060 It's just, you know, play around with some extra stuff.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0151060_0151220 Have some time. Bye.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153025_0153272 Was that informatics? Of course.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153272_0153425 Yeah, it's a...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0153425_0153739 I would play digital and content.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0156246_0156562 I'll be happy when this week is over.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157002_0157469 Yeah. I know, is that about it then? Anything else we need to discuss?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0157652_0158052 Did we want to meet before we talk to Steve next week?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158298_0158434 Well, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0158434_0159102 We'll probably get some work done over the weekend, so I know if after DNLG or something, maybe just have a little quick little update and just...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159414_0159510 We can decide that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0159510_0159565 네, 잘하셨습니다.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160177_0160605 You're gonna do the search.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160605_0160782 Könnt ihr da noch?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0160782_0161336 Well, it'll be still a limited version of the next query.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161336_0161524 Hmm.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161524_0161669 Won't be a whole thing then.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0161669_0161948 Um, like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162062_0162239 Well actually, moves are just down on hacks.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0162239_0162386 Das war's.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0163096_0163352 There's a rain. Tell the truth.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0164731_0165115 Yeah, they'll get behind schedule. Yeah, pretty quick.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165115_0165239 Like you're saying.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165239_0165581 Actually, do we want to set a date for intro prototype?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0165701_0165820 Specifically, I think.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0174020_0174401 Yes, it's quite messy, yes it is.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0175200_0175308 I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177666_0177789 Nice, not easy, yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0177789_0177962 So, this is our 11th of the week.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0179495_0179561 el CIMO.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181028_0181137 Just like the bass.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181137_0181361 No more ready?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0181742_0182107 Just like all the unseeing the code and just sort of howl. Just to see the basics of what you've done.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182107_0182452 We just get a quick look over and just... Can take us to a tutorial.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182497_0182770 or like, like, you know, the class path, so all that sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0182770_0183332 Just say, well here's everything's basically all set up.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183644_0183749 다시 봐봐
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0183976_0184292 In the morning.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184735_0184862 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0184862_0185309 Well, I think it was a good one. Something like that could happen anytime.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185309_0185690 Like my schedule is like a class, break class, break class.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185690_0185974 It's not going to take an hour. Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm thinking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0185974_0186364 So something like that, and then if I have a class I can run off. Do it. Yeah, pick your time.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0186612_0186822 To Monday, Monday might be good.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187025_0187110 What's the text?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187237_0187767 Anytime. Not at noon or two or four.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0187767_0188059 No, in between those, yeah. Like one, three.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189157_0189286 Yeah, that's an option too.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189286_0189383 Doctor King.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0189596_0189653 Please kid
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190197 or 330.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190197_0190345 I just... yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190345_0190549 necessary
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0190727_0190876 Actually, we just had a skidding there, though.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0191260_0191791 Can I have your game? We can get in through the computer rooms in here.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192004_0192373 Well if you find me I'll show you where I'll let us all in
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192373_0192682 No, we can look out in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0192682_0192781 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193087_0193279 This is my thing. Yeah, it's unreal.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193279_0193562 I was just asking Steve about that weather we can get in there.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193562_0193757 whether he's gonna get us access into this.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0193869_0193922 Thank you very much.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0194295_0194371 It would do.

AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0195774_0196406 We can photocopy your assignment. What the fuck?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0196431_0196575 Well, the comments I'm thinking.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197063_0197125 미안하죠
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197125_0197320 So, after this...
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0197879_0198035 As long as Dignalchi doesn't go late.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199514_0199666 Сам злот митель?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199840_0199917 はい
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199917_0199994 Well, that's from the post.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0199994_0200131 But we care.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200785_0200843 That's crazy.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0200979_0201027 I'm so excited.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0201901_0202026 Something like that.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202026_0202188 I think we're a couple classes
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202392_0202622 It was bizarre, really. They didn't really know that was going to happen.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202622_0202650 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0202962_0203257 You guys up to the professor whether they did it or not?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203257_0203347 Well, I don't feel like it.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203347_0203466 No.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203466_0203610 I think what?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0203610_0204092 I think the IEL will probably have one to make up for missing classes. What?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0204092_0204431 D.O.L. More probably. Yeah, we will probably.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0206079_0206202 Oh, wait, trust ya.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0207928_0208146 You're not gonna?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208436_0208731 You really want multiple windows from a single app.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0208960_0209241 But most will probably want to go with the faults.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209692_0209717 from
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0209873_0210490 Yeah, exactly. Just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation.
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210621_0210766 Can you just play?
AMI_EN2002a_SDM_MEE073_0210766_0210858 What kind of accent?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0002480_0002851 I think it was the difference.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004285_0004363 Stoję.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0004581_0004696 I'm...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0006202_0006252 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008166_0008661 Very interesting stuff at the meeting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0008661_0008947 I'm giving myself a big round of applause.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0023120_0024443 Perfection. Yeah. That idea. Let's just cut out the middle mess. Yeah, exactly. Because I'm gonna tell you to go and roll anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024443_0024853 Nemáme být... To velice.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0024853_0025092 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0025508_0025538 I'm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0026675_0027547 I'll look at it like my usual working hours are like from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0027547_0029410 I know he always online! It always makes me feel bad because when I go to bed at like one you're still online! He never goes to bed! Sleep, I just leave your computer on maybe. Yeah, he pretends, always busy. Yeah, right. So maybe...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029410_0029595 But I'm never online in the morning.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0029595_0030227 You notice that going in?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0030764_0031418 Yeah, do what you want to do with it first and then I'll... I'll tell you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0031418_0031794 Was there anything else we wanted
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033101_0033591 Probably want to think about it if we want to change our goals and stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0033591_0034574 I think one thing that we could probably skip totally is the removing things from the body of fire.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0034821_0035259 I'm gonna attempt that. No. I don't think so. I'm too big.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0037281_0037580 Yeah, but that's definitely one thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0041751_0041938 My, yeah, I'm a pretty sub-gooie.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0042617_0044950 Yeah, yeah. More or less. Yeah, but it's... It's very... Well... Plus or minus three days. It doesn't have to note. Yeah, it's okay. That's good. I mean, yeah, I haven't... I mean, it's unfinished, but... So I've only got safe days to do the topic segment, right? Jesus. You don't have any SPLPS items, do you?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053678_0053740 Um...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0053740_0054016 We should probably eat things. Sorry, we should probably eat things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0056905_0057415 Should we, I don't know, we think might, but our things that we have gathered
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057415_0057650 Put those apart.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0057650_0058070 I'm sure you're like, I'm like, I'm pretty far. Yeah, but what about them?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058198_0058396 I'm gonna do this for the teeth.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058396_0058593 What for skipping the audio?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0058775_0059373 You just keep it together on the paper. Have you taken it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059565_0059750 Dat is goed.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0059750_0059870 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0060478_0060694 Yeah. We could just meet another one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064215_0064651 Yeah, my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0064651_0065348 I don't know who is sending it back in a few sentences to what I am done
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065842_0065968 네, 네, 네.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0065968_0066281 And also, sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066281_0066343 I ain't right now.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0066765_0066801 BOOM
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067581_0067962 Well, I still like struggling with job of stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0067962_0068274 Yeah, but welcome, welcome.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068274_0068805 I think I was wondering about that is I haven't looked at it so much
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0068805_0069665 But if you guys know how you can do that, like from the extract words that you did,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0069665_0070203 Like also it's extract time stamps and...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074139_0074374 So now I can just fill it in some.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074504_0074606 on the other end.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0074844_0074902 What on the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0075883_0075962 Poczek.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0089209_0089625 No. No. So this is when we click.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0090755_0090862 often at the same time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0115911_0115974 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0118646_0118718 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0121631_0121738 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0123724_0123835 Yeah, only, only...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0125288_0125530 Okay, the mouse, the mouse not...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0126896_0127147 We were not really well...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127290_0127571 We're not gonna do much more than just look at the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0127716_0128450 The text will remove the differences. Because we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna listen to it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128644_0128816 That's what I'm doing the audio thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0128989_0129377 So I guess just displaying it is... Despiring it is... Despiring it is...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0129377_0129503 Yeah, yeah, I don't mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0130870_0130929 because that says
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131677_0131891 It's probably the best thing to do in this year's year.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0131891_0132149 I don't think it's gonna take long to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0153855_0154032 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0169683_0170405 Maybe a sleep.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0170405_0170552 Bye.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0171979_0172091 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172091_0172338 Yeah, okay, no, no, actually that's good idea, I'll take it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0172761_0173069 Stick it together, she'll shine it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0173660_0174199 anchoring back any things that I thought was wrong.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174199_0174381 They were changing dialogue.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0174381_0174703 I'm back. I love you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175396_0175540 I'm not sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175540_0175983 I'm going to do like four lines.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO070_0175983_0176353 Um, yeah, I'm proud of Ferry, Merle, Liz.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0012313_0012414 Love time, huh?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0013926_0014135 You see it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014135_0014222 네
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014265_0014294 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014437_0014850 I'm not sure if we need the outline of the prototype.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0014850_0015021 I mean, what are we gonna point?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015441_0015688 Yeah, because you have that space. I put screenshots and all those here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0015688_0015753 The whole
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025379_0025658 Yeah well, I mean it's up to you if you want to keep going with that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025658_0025799 I'm happy to do something as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0025799_0025919 I have lots of time tonight.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026045_0026664 And then I'll send it to you and you can do the final roof.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0026664_0026730 Buh!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027533_0027852 I know you're always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0027852_0028436 It always makes me feel bad because when I go to bed at like one you're still online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028436_0028592 He never got back.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0028865_0029045 Yeah, he pretend.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029045_0029133 Oh, c'est bêtis !
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029133_0029280 You're correct.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0029280_0029409 Yeah, so maybe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032386_0032508 That's not right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032508_0032636 That's your special ritual.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0032636_0032810 Oh, this is the one that...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0034547_0034909 That's what I thought as well, I mean, are we actually going to attempt that?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035060_0035247 I just think so. I'm too big.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0035247_0035573 I think that's going to be, we don't even know how to approach that at the moment, I think.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036630_0036715 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036715_0036928 Yeah, yeah, that's all right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0036928_0037935 We should definitely, well we could probably not put it under this heading.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0037935_0038266 but putting on the changes since the initial investigation.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0038266_0038901 and say we didn't decide the time is too short
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0039384_0039848 We prefer to concentrate on the main.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0040496_0041100 And I think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041252_0041505 Or some of the words a bit later, or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041758_0041920 Like, yeah, it's not a price tag.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0041920_0042435 You know, yeah, yeah, nice.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042609_0042719 Yeah, more or less.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0042719_0042856 Yeah, please.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045213_0045428 And you can say, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0045428_0046024 We are still aiming for the development to be complete and in the march.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0047485_0047593 好
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048189_0048321 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048321_0048439 I don't really want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048439_0048678 Like this is him now. It's not gonna be difficult.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0048678_0049161 at least have all the information pop up that is already in the metadata file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049161_0049366 That's gonna be the work.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0049366_0049523 So it's definitely going to be something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0050130_0050484 Yeah, we might turn out what you didn't thought.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0052660_0052741 Yeah, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053015_0053059 Thank you very much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0053774_0054353 We should probably do another responsibility of packages as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0054353_0054961 That's what he hinted that we should also indicate who is responsible for what. For now on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0055764_0056002 where you could put, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0060677_0060763 Say, I-
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0061496_0061766 Have you managed any further on the search thing?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0062920_0062973 So be warned.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0063613_0063708 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0076781_0077134 So, did you have you made another Mbrowser?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0077134_0077273 Is there something that I should...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078221_0078524 No, since you don't know us. To try the night.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0078524_0078671 I thought you said... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079643_0079886 아까미가.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0079886_0080250 Weekends out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0083744_0083850 Sorry, probable.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084213_0084627 At the moment is there a window that comes up?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084627_0084835 What was that? A second result of pain?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0084835_0085080 or is it, you know, it's a little larger.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0085080_0085345 I thought we were...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090405_0090683 tabs. I like the little tabs. But then you can't see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0090855_0091354 But you want to compare the result, the one topic result with one summary result.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091653_0091831 I don't see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0091831_0092168 If you get results for the same meeting.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092292_0092417 So let's end the video here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0092417_0092558 Be kind to the trust.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093213_0093492 I mean, we could order them by meeting, for example.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093846_0093986 Reorder by
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0093986_0094497 Yeah well I mean if that's even the second step the first question is do we want to order them?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0094497_0094659 How do we want all of them in first place?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0095725_0095842 Yeah, maybe you should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098204_0098433 Yeah, why don't you just...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098544_0098638 Color code those.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0098797_0099022 the results to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101350_0101436 Never if you...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101561_0101936 If you do it straight from, you know, you get the result.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0101936_0102270 and then there's some if statement saying it's straight on the unit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0102270_0102935 rock bottom level saying if you found a segment then print it and read all of that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103083_0103179 As opposed to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0103884_0103924 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104204_0104330 Well, trying to do
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0104991_0105085 mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105335_0105452 Working with an event.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0105878_0106013 Oh, oh, I see ya.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106358_0106545 people figure something out like that so we're
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0106955_0107583 Yeah, I mean at the moment it works. It works with highlighting in the transcript window, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0109010_0109145 What do you mean you two work with him?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0110572_0111480 Yeah, I mean the whole, what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pain made by night.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111480_0111676 I am not sure what's going on now.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0111951_0112094 行
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112214_0112478 I don't know what I know what it's called.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112478_0112878 And that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0112878_0113350 As I said, if you left click on something for example, it highlights automatically.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0113350_0113593 So maybe it comes with something close as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114147_0114464 No, I'm sure it was not pain in it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114635_0114909 あららら、テクス、テクス、いやー、そんなの?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0114909_0115049 Come on, come on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115049_0115317 No, I don't text. Most things are good. No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115317_0115547 Yeah, well, it's not many, mate.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0115547_0115719 Night object model?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122144_0122353 Why do we want it in XML then?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0122353_0122857 I mean I thought we just selectively, selectively write the XML that we've got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123113_0123303 So as opposed to...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123577_0123610 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0123720_0124313 Yeah, only print out certain segments of segments that we want, just selectively.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124313_0124485 At the moment it prints out all of them.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124485_0124910 We'll just put a niff loop in it. That leaves out some of the pain.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0124910_0125118 Not, not store it at all whatsoever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0125724_0125789 I'm not
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129048_0129102 So I'm gonna get
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129404_0129617 Yeah, yeah, I don't really need to do much more with it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0129617_0129694 2
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0131930_0132233 I don't think it's going to take long to produce anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0132233_0133122 It's just another... I mean these meetings are not endlessly long, it's just words and to print all of them out, it's like they're great.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0134416_0135016 You can nearly do it together with the transcription, with the original transcription, having them run parallel.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135186_0135590 So if it's a proper word...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0135590_0136024 print it on both paints and if it's not proper work then print only on one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136024_0136232 I mean that's fancy, but...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0136493_0136570 E aí, meu amigo?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137075_0137136 So then...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0137251_0138184 You know, the good way of doing it, not together, is that if someone doesn't want to look at the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138184_0138407 you know, the chop file and you don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138548_0138826 But I mean you can you know
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0138826_0139583 you can write something like we'll try and do it on the fly and observe if that's going to take too long.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0139583_0140140 if it's going to take too long, well think about writing it to a file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0140299_0140382 Fasten straight
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0141684_0141738 Alright.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0151881_0152103 That's what programming is all about, I'm afraid.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153323_0153432 네.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0153895_0153967 Well, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154087_0154810 Yeah, why don't you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both of something?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154810_0154970 If you want to do it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0154970_0155409 I person you don't want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0155409_0155526 I want to do it super fishlink.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0158643_0158795 Well it has already loaded anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0160386_0160730 So shall we all write a letter or two about future work as well?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0160914_0160996 Je vais le laisser.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161180_0161213 Bye bye.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161522_0161681 Yeah, well maybe. And some good...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0161799_0161936 I'm not sure if you guys are the best.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0162278_0162642 Yeah, like, what we've done already and then, you know, you might lose a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164106_0164193 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164255_0164357 Ja mam im.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0164930_0165079 and continuity.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168333_0168547 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168547_0168840 Anything else? Anyone else to talk about?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0168840_0169092 Do I have sleep already?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0169365_0169426 burnt out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0169934_0170046 Maybe a sleep.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0170046_0171229 So we're all still writing our summary sending them to you, you send it over.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0171534_0171616 How kind.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0173065_0173652 and then send it on to us so that we can nod. Curly of humanity. Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0174996_0175109 Sounds good. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0175109_0175452 I haven't used my pen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_FEO072_0176567_0176635 See you later.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0013743_0013850 تخيل يا فن
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0013850_0013946 I see that's fun.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0016742_0017526 Yeah, we can find something after. This could be just some... just describe some screenshots.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018361_0018535 Yeah, you can either, we can just ignore that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0018535_0018610 はい、よし
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019159_0019391 You can't have your ass squinch all the time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0019391_0020010 Do they have screenshots by the thing, each one or have just a bunch of them in one section?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020010_0020078 Yes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0020992_0021379 I've written the topic secondhand session before. Cool.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022275_0022355 That's how I'm...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022355_0022375 We
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0022984_0023725 I think that it is shit doing it. No, perfectionist. Yes!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023859_0023970 네, 예, 이상해!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0023970_0024180 Because I'm gonna tell you guys about it anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0024180_0024754 Ben de öyle...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0026408_0026889 You can do the final roof.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0028261_0028966 He never got back. Sleep.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0031135_0031257 So, it's all right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0035738_0036107 It's a good thing to have to say what we could have done if we had more time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036107_0036226 Good for you to work things, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036226_0036472 It's the conclusion. Yeah. It's a fun report.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0036472_0036842 Should have we had more time to listen to him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's alright.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0037097_0037360 Yeah, that's that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038504_0038624 Bu da decided
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0038837_0039136 I always felt there are more important things to do at our time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0039295_0039468 than wearing them out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041533_0041627 Yes.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0041627_0041784 Have you ever seen a section?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042375_0042600 Best for our target also.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0042801_0043608 It's very... Plus or minus three days. It doesn't... It's a note. Yeah, that's a good thing. It's true.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0044105_0044380 If I only got six days to do the topic segment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0045439_0045574 We're still angry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046016_0046324 Speaking character is supposed to be done already. Alright.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0046324_0046575 Yeah, take that kid. He's home.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047298_0047592 Give me a wink and I'll tell you the answer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0047900_0048145 Maybe the speaker characterization might get slimmer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0048322_0048580 I don't really want to do it. We like this a bit now.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049534_0049781 We might make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0049921_0050095 Na bármány, ne lőj már, nem?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050095_0050312 Yeah, we might turn up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0050861_0051348 The stomach segmentation with LC-seg and TX-1000 basically done.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051348_0051744 Just gets to be the Kaya tune there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0051744_0052069 Searched in the parameters but it's made in the little zone.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0052069_0052298 Let's see what happens.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0055240_0055341 y que se va a hacer
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0065809_0065877 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0066825_0067239 How about the underlying data for it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067239_0067390 for the duplicated file.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0067390_0067474 おはよう
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0068144_0068204 Kto?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070071_0070141 Easy, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0070141_0071209 Yeah, when he pulls up the segments, part of that, one of the attributes, if you do get attributes, call the method.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071209_0071456 yw'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r adegau'r
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071456_0071927 Search through those and then just you can tell us any what actually is got.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0071927_0072435 And then you get automatically all you can just hard code and say look get me the timestamps.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0072435_0073145 Felly, ydych chi'n ddweud, yn ymwneud, ym mhwnt yn ymwneud, yn ymwneud, ac mae'n ddweud, yn ymwneud, yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073145_0073437 Okay. And I'll tell you the start times and end times. Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0073437_0073534 I think it would say it's a double.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074447_0074908 Yeah, that's on the norm right elements. What on the...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0074908_0075230 The object is a non-right element, I think.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0075640_0075774 That's it, time to go then.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088240_0088442 Well, I have to... ...that you'd confuse me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0088442_0088847 Do you have three separate windows with three separate different types of windows?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089021_0089334 Okay, not as really different. No, no, no. Okay, good, no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0089480_0089529 So
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0090204_0090299 Or 10, 6, 20.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0091839_0091961 See you again!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0113936_0114207 You've got a nice text playing on something, even.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114207_0114225 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0114691_0114955 テクス?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115139_0115208 まっちゃいっすよ
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115208_0115321 My say is good no.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115533_0115991 Night's object model?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0115991_0116432 Night Objects model nothing, cause I know it's a bit...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0117869_0117982 Będzie ja...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118130_0118569 the... removing the disparities. Have you done anything with that yet?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0118766_0119675 because I was wondering how we're going to write it back to HTML, I mean XML if we did the processing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0119829_0119979 Right, I'm getting back to talking some more.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120575_0120691 It's a brilliant text.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0120820_0120872 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121398_0121828 It will very much limit what you can do there, it's nine next to one for me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0121828_0122215 There is some bizarre method that puts things back into excellent helpful.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0123311_0123783 Oh, select what we want, just take bits of the XML, only take certain segments.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124458_0124617 We'll just put a new fluke in it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124617_0124713 That leaves us
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124713_0124801 Seven six.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0124801_0124917 I can. Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125458_0125580 He says something there on it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125580_0125640 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125789_0125942 and written to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0125942_0126120 This makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126120_0126533 But that will mean that you can only do things on, actually no, like you can only do things on word level.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0126533_0126623 So yeah, that was fun.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129316_0129464 This one is time for you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0129659_0129757 I think it's like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130301_0130473 would just be a blabber summary
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0130473_0130975 it won't look like it won't say, speaker X says this, speaker Y says that, speaker Z says this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131287_0131598 They will look ugly probably because it will look just black and white.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0131598_0131725 Les sigo hasta acá.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0132163_0132382 use anyway it's just another
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133236_0133358 Das haben wir frei, oder?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0133510_0133859 So then it just goes through and says that this word equals that imprint.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0134183_0134337 To pan co jest na ten zim?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136501_0136598 Yeah, you probably kid it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136598_0136789 I think that's probably not as difficult
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136789_0136955 You just think fatten the code out a bit.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0136955_0137127 Yeah, but then...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0138300_0138507 You don't ever have to produce it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140016_0140051 to the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140051_0140536 They just be if stamens. They're fast if stamens.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0140536_0140696 I was just thinking though, I didn't miss a copy of it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0141246_0141295 No sé.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0143934_0144261 Although I'm not flying too quickly.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144261_0144569 Even trying to read it in XMO, which I've always complicated enough.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0144569_0145137 I gave up doing that, but I didn't develop it back to night stuff because it was not too much or much easy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145283_0145518 Because we do it with that stuff, doing those things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0145518_0145969 Mae'r bobl yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146180_0146289 You can believe it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0146289_0147004 You have to start defining object models like the night thing and the game. All bizarre, weird things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0147004_0147093 So, see you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0157867_0157939 Especially the weak.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0158908_0159085 Yeah, it's after it's loaded.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159237_0159400 It's just a fall, really.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0159400_0159494 Yeah, fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0160891_0161131 I'm going to do the future work in my own section.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0161282_0162274 I just said I've done so far and what I'm gonna do. Yeah, well maybe. And some issues. No, you can't let that happen. Um, I'll wait until each...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162274_0162383 At least this
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162560_0162760 You might lose a bit of continuity if you do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162760_0162852 Adios a vos aquí.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0162852_0163194 Sometimes it's easy to have the top in its own instructions.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163194_0163417 Thanks for your time.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0163985_0164101 Caos, não sabe.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164101_0164355 Yes. Bullet points.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164381_0164747 Because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0164747_0165061 If they're not together you lose a lot of continuity.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0165202_0165243 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0168522_0168675 So, that's the nuts?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172742_0172828 You stick it together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0172828_0172899 しようしようね
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0176443_0176700 Oh, man, this is a demo.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178273_0178394 12 days of rent, yeah?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE071_0178394_0178659 That must be the idea.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003903_0003990 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0003990_0004240 bike technology. Bye.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004240_0004381 Pratik, das ist es.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004495_0004612 Tchau!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0004745_0005954 I wish I could first thing I just sort of did a really sort of brief version of what we have to do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0005954_0006231 the
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012470_0012730 Actually, without I was just copying one straight over the other, darkening it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0012730_0013102 So it's all a- whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0013772_0013822 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014111_0014174 Oh, sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0014174_0014244 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015004_0015184 Well, just sort of... Well, the thing's out.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015184_0015707 We're going to be touching on all that during the other part for the purpose. Yeah, here's how that's been. I'm going to put your screenshots in all of those here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015707_0015897 Yeah
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0015897_0016426 Well, it's just something that he had mentioned in the previous, like just to sort of have a prototype together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016426_0016728 and the sort of thing that we could potentially do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016728_0016792 Yeah, we can
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0016792_0016898 這發生什麼事了
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017730_0017785 Yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0017785_0018043 Like the thing is I was thinking even the stuff that I was doing
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018043_0018395 just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018395_0018519 You need that, come on, we can just ignore it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018519_0018560 안녕
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018560_0018829 Oh yes, get home actually, I had that at the very end, screenshot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018829_0018936 Put that in chop on the screen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0018936_0019111 Pas les mains en haut.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020934 Anyways, so, um, so yeah, this is just very general structure. I guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and, I don't know. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021133_0021163 All right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021313_0021454 That's great.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021454_0021977 Um, so I know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this, I could do that before I meet with you guys.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0021977_0022293 Oh, otherwise? No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0022293_0022953 Um, if there's anyone else wanna throw it together, actually I can probably still throw it together if you want. Put your parts into this one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023125_0023329 Nah, perfectionist.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023630_0023745 www
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0023745_0024214 He's cut out the middle man. He's gonna charge it go everywhere.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0024214_0024440 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0027526_0027739 I know, it's always online!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028668_0028943 I just figured you're wrong.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0028943_0029179 He pretends. Always busy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0029731_0030110 Notice that, no one is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030110_0030238 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030488_0030619 So I'll send it off to you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0030619_0030654 I know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031329_0031464 Thanks.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031677_0031881 Was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0031881_0032249 I mean, essentially was what my... You can't see it right back.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032249_0032460 Mom, please feel whole.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032460_0032772 Oh, that's the original one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0032772_0033027 Yeah, yeah, let's just copy each riddle.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0036788_0037258 Unless we just cover some sort of time warp things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0038142_0038232 Perversification.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041160_0041286 This this one's
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041286_0041566 Or some of them were a bit later or somewhere. Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0041566_0041631 Ok, va.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042654_0042791 More or less.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042881_0042968 through it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0042968_0043351 Plus or minus three days. He doesn't have to know it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043351_0043505 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0043505_0043786 I mean, yeah, I mean...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044331_0044624 Yes!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0044624_0045064 If you don't have any SPMLPS I will steal one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046238_0046442 All right. Yeah, see you guys.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046442_0046502 뭐야
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0046502_0047118 For one of those, something that you want to change and delete from a list of expectations.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0047576_0047898 Should we put it? I hint that something like that might happen into the document.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0048484_0048561 It's not.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049218_0049277 Just what?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049277_0049343 That's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0049542_0049639 That make it disappear
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0051551_0051685 To the cahia to
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0054984_0055312 Like, I probably just can't be that straight over here long as well. Yeah, pretty much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055312_0055519 That's essentially the same as it was.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0055519_0055766 More detailed specifically.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057504_0057594 Split those apart.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057638_0057891 Dat doe ik zo heel erg.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0057891_0058016 Yeah, but whatever
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0058470_0058757 Well, if we're skipping the audio one, then it's not easy.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059159_0059383 Have you taken it for a quick look?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059383_0059545 Have you taken any more of look at it?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059545_0059671 Have a good one.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0059852_0059926 You could probably.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060166_0060504 I know for a long time to look at that before tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060504_0060724 We could just make it up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0060724_0061147 Like I'll clean one, you clean the other for the search things and then we can leave that in this enjoyment.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061295_0061394 Come on, pick it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0061780_0062365 I found, finally, today, something that I can build it in, and I should have something for tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0062365_0063158 I should at least have a gooey, white wire. I'll be wiring that in hopefully to our mind.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063158_0063436 So I want to get something, I want to see this, I want to get together.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0063436_0063952 I haven't mentioned my mom, and I didn't see it on the thing, and then, give me a screenshot.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065078_0065557 It's too much. It doesn't really matter. I mean, if you write this, it says first as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065557_0065912 I mean, with the intention that... Yeah. This is your own.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0065912_0066273 I mean, also, sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066273_0066537 I write down the words and the ideas as well.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0066537_0066801 You all do this something? Yeah. Yeah. All for most people.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0067941_0067973 Buh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077159_0077621 something that I should. There is but I've made a lot of changes to it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077621_0077969 so I might just down delete what I've done and copy again from here.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0077969_0078306 Because I'm sure you've probably made some changes already. No, since you don't.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078306_0078362 Oh, gross.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078362_0078473 Subscribe now
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078539_0078676 I thought you said... Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078676_0078817 Alright, I see.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0078856_0079508 I think you said you'd give it written something that maybe I've caught some bugs and that you were gonna fix those on the weekend or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079508_0079598 No. Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0079847 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0079969_0080142 오케이, 그럼.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080142_0080966 All other stuff out there that... Actually, I'm going to try and minimize the amount of changes I make to Ambrowser anyways.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0080966_0081036 Chin-Tang.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081165_0081248 请别人说
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081248_0081582 Actually, just to clarify, last week when we were talking about our search results...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0081582_0082029 Like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as functions.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082114_0082502 Do we want separate result panes for each of those?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0082502_0083092 or do you want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083092_0083471 so that when they click on that it's going to go to the relevant thing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0083471_0083998 Like just if they check all three same topics, sorry, how three different windows come up?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0084148_0084359 or three like so.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085039_0085733 I think we sort of discussed last week the style that's on the same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0085733_0086046 So it will be on the search window, bottom half of the search window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086046_0086485 I know we still want to keep it that way, but that's that's what it's gonna be working on
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086485_0086802 So it's just like you click those and it just loads up.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0086802_0087255 Yeah, splits that thing into two or three or whatever it is. One, two, three, depending on which
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087255_0087384 I'm just going to check.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087384_0087866 So if we want to do it that way, it probably doesn't matter too much.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0087866_0088246 Just try and think of there's going to be any other issues down the road. I would, depending on.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0088813_0089409 No, just just paint, just resolve paints. Okay, not really different. No, no, no. Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089409_0089503 Don't.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089503_0089859 So it's just when we click topics and summaries for what we want to search.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0089859_0090212 there will be two result pains.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090212_0090467 I don't know, really, calves.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0090467_0090932 I like the idea of tap but then you can't see all of them at the same time and it's just like
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0091303_0091783 Well, it's no, but the things if you're looking, if you check them both, you'll see all the results.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092178_0092282 Ja, exakt.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0092314_0093320 So I'm ready on the topic and then transcribe it. That's true. Or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0093620_0094088 Oh yeah, I guess that's the other thing whether we want to have this reorder by... Yeah, well, I mean, they...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094088_0094233 You know that's...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094233_0094296 2번째
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094729_0094978 I think, yeah, probably my meeting makes no sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0094978_0095288 I mean, essentially they're 10, you know, in time order.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095288_0095598 So, that kind of makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0095767_0095835 You should do that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096204_0096458 去避疫情
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0096458_0096585 should be for losing it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0098888_0099364 Sometimes in a case like that, I run across some in other languages.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099364_0099946 It's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally, once it's put into a list box or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0099946_0100175 It's hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100175_0100452 and then we're highlighting something in the transcript window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0100452_0101260 it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in all this box and I don't know this box.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101260_0101496 Non.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0101496_0101599 Where's it coming from?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103036_0103108 A z tym...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103329_0103842 Um, yeah, it's just like from past experience up, there's goofy little things that happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0103842_0104599 It'll just let you save certain things and it just can't... Well... Trying to do a different kind of... to go to a different window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0104599_0105080 So if you want to come to the actual highlight the transcript, not highlight the topic.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105080_0105308 At that point, that's where we start getting a little bit tricky.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105308_0105835 because you're working with an event handler within the one panel or a loosebox, whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0105835_0105890 No.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106024_0106677 There are ways around it, but whether I'll be able to figure something out before tomorrow, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106677_0106952 Or don't get to know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0106952_0107083 Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107588_0107656 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0107851_0108601 I think he was saying that as long as we implement that interface, it should work with anything that we do.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108601_0108763 Like highlighting?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0108763_0109120 I think that was some... who you're saying? What do you mean, you two work with each other?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109120_0109343 Um, I think Jonathan's doing something wrong.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109343_0109760 I think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0109760_0110058 so we should be able to have that highlighting happen.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110058_0110116 Buh
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0110116_0110158 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0113476_0113968 Maybe I should use that as well anyway.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115367_0115504 What? There's no many women...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0115704_0115871 Okay, thanks.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0119968_0120335 I thought we were just going to have that as words.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0120335_0121016 Like not as XML, just sort of as a... What was that? Textbook? Well, transcript.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121016_0121339 No, because then we need all the other data from the link to keep it a transcript.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121635_0121783 いや、マシゴニャン
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0121783_0121815 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125252_0125286 Bye.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125286_0125531 Okay, the next note.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125531_0125664 Yeah, thanks, bro.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125664_0125902 That's right.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0125902_0126033 Actually, but this makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0126624_0126989 Yeah, if we're gonna do the X-Mile one, fine. That's not probably a good idea.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129344_0129433 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0129704_0130120 I think it's like, well how would we display it though? Like if we do take this for a new season, just, you know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130120_0130471 credit tax file, I think they just want to tax the file. It would just be a blurb like a summary.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0130967_0131486 Unless we extract that over the file when we create the text file. Yeah, and that will look ugly probably because it will look...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0131568_0131631 That's realistic.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140401_0140531 First.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0140531_0141101 I was just thinking as well, I mean you could probably even use like XSLT to kind of just transform it and...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141101_0141775 flip it into just the transform zone like um style sheet down
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0141775_0142195 and it's kind of like there's usually things built in too. Well, it should be built into Genoa.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142195_0142837 and process XML into. It just creates whatever file it's going to be.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0142837_0143107 Well, it's been a couple years since I looked at anything like this.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143107_0143373 咱們音樂明星玩
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143373_0143725 And then that way we could even pre-process that beforehand.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143725_0143963 I don't know, we don't want to have to do that, right?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0143963_0144215 Although I'm not fine with it.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144532_0144657 I gave up doing that.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0144657_0144731 Alright, guys.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0145444_0145524 Okay.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146551_0146596 Ну это
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146596_0146733 in games.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0146895_0146946 Soll sein.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147168_0147522 Actually, I was thinking I might try and talk to... Who's a Jonathan Jean?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147522_0147857 just to see what system they used to develop this stuff.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0147857_0148685 It would be nice to have all the tools there and just have the object model and just kind of plug and play with everything and just actually use the system.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148685_0148921 You would a higher level rather than kind of your
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0148921_0149202 playing around with a little bit of code and modifying your code and getting some...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149202_0149408 And I just sort of see what they're doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149408_0149827 So I went to try and contact them, see if there's...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0149964_0150225 Neither hits the gigabits.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150225_0150542 Just to get things moving at a higher level, I guess.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0150688_0151137 Seems to be more interesting to use it as a real developer.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151304_0151743 It just seems like a little tinkering here and here. I'm just adding a couple things in.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0151889_0151929 What?
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152034_0152305 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152305_0152397 It should be higher level.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0152397_0153316 It should be conceptual and brilliant ideas and then just bringing those to reality.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0153441_0153811 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0155864_0156372 Like the thing that I was thinking there as well is that once it's done for one meeting, it's done. Yes, there.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156372_0156430 It's fine.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156430_0156582 text file or XML or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0156582_0157089 Yeah, just, I don't know, it doesn't make any difference really either way to me.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157089_0157402 It's like, hmm, if it's fast enough on the flying and shrimp.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157402_0157749 That's about the only intro I have with On the Fly, whether it's fast or not.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0157956_0158182 Especially with Java and all those other things.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0158182_0158649 If it's loading the file and doing some processing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0159496_0159838 Well, that's what I'm remembering. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161181_0161213 Alright.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0161805_0161922 Yeah, that's a letter.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0162054_0162383 I can do it. At least this...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163146_0163210 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163372_0163537 I think that does make sense.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0163537_0164018 But maybe at the end, maybe just a point form of things that we're still working on, things that we're still doing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164018_0164192 or something.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0164712_0164801 Yeah, they're not singing.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0165141_0165226 you
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168112_0168210 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0168501_0168596 네
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171165_0171447 Or she'll just take chicken to go for a meal.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171447_0171516 That's my man.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171516_0171724 How kind!
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0171724_0172114 I can guess for a second.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172114_0172473 Yeah, okay, actually that's a good idea. I'll take one quick look over.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0172473_0172728 Try and get it as good as I think, don't we? Yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0173283_0173628 I'm sorry for my mistake.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0174290_0174848 They were changing dialogue back. I love you.
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0175479_0175581 拜拜
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176364_0176543 Oh, oh, mas...
AMI_EN2002b_SDM_MEE073_0176882_0177179 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0005327_0005656 Did we get sent out to temple, y'all? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0010714_0010759 I'm done.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012507_0012860 I think there is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0012860_0014128 Just because the topic box and all this is based on what was it called? Non-night text area or something?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014128_0014333 Intext is always...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014333_0014626 It has some sort of highlighting stuff there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0014626_0014856 So you should probably look at the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0015536_0015731 I'm not sure if it's in-built, though, to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0016668_0016786 Right, right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018250_0018339 You got it. No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018339_0018522 Absolutely. If something was going to do that...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0018522_0018869 Yeah, I was thinking about it. Then tell me how you...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0019053_0019099 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0021698_0021836 오케이
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0022987_0023159 Okay, yeah, see what I mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023159_0023237 everything but that's
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023237_0023267 Bye bye.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0023520_0024002 So, I have your already calculated the states of what? Are you supposed to do that? Yes, basically you'll
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0024002_0024042 Bye, Rhett.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0026456_0026737 I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0031624_0031695 O, nie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0033862_0034307 What the easiest thing to do is how you want to display it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034307_0034400 Yeah, just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0034863_0035710 So what, whenever we open a window for one speaker. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036852_0036935 Nie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0036935_0037078 Big bit. Pretty much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0038146_0038190 Oh, is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042122_0042347 The one present.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0042347_0042747 Although we could do one highlight today, I suppose.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0044963_0045399 I mean that would be implementing what he said.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045399_0045889 that you want to see per topic, you want to see which one spoke in most something like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0045889_0046420 So you could zap through these topics? Meetings. Meeting, sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0046420_0047031 And it would come up with how much they spoke and you could pick the one that looks smooth. Yeah, that would be easy as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047031_0047163 So, trying that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0047936_0048004 Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0048166_0048640 So, yeah, random things like just return talking time. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0049178_0049243 네
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055128_0055476 Can you put in there what topic was spoken about as well? Yeah, yeah, there'll be.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0055476_0055829 I could use that for the topic pop-up window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056075_0056113 But that was-
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0056541_0056607 That was enough.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0057730_0058078 Because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0058078_0058747 So you have the option of popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060366_0060622 So how would you calculate that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0060622_0061042 Would you do the summarization as you popularize it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061042_0061259 What the GLAM statistics comes from after that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0061553_0062005 Alright, so that is all stored together. The speaker class knows about all of that stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062005_0062172 Alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062567_0062708 Sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0062708_0063054 Co, heavy down dice? No, no i woda i ja wytrzydzę w kół.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063054_0063276 You just got to decide on what we are there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063527_0063800 I thought the other stuff was more important than anything else, so I did that first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0063948_0064594 Felly mae'n gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r gweithio'r g
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0066667_0066722 Oh, I see.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067308_0067648 Well, let me know when it's sort of usable.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0067648_0067710 If you can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068138_0068232 우리 민희 배우죠
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068232_0068607 Just in just that. Yeah, but it's not going to take place.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0068607_0068783 I mean, is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070272_0070386 Das war's gut.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070386_0070452 So where's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070452_0070695 Is that stored in the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0070898_0071135 On your own, don't you? Not in there? No, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0071468_0071520 En fait,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0072563_0073206 What are you wanting to write that in directly or what do you want to do about that? What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073206_0073320 If you want to change my code.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0073552_0074028 Yeah, but do you want to change that the original Embrother Fallon?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074028_0074121 No. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074288_0074356 Have you done that now?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0074568_0074831 Oh, okay, so not the actual one, but a copy of it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075146_0075269 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075269_0075311 There we go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075690_0075818 Well just, just how's it went?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0075818_0076625 because I usually work on my own copy for the day and then updates without checking if the one in the show has changed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0076625_0076783 I have a meeting changes too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0077208_0077283 Yeah, and...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0078579_0078992 Those are what you're working on now to present results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0079726_0079893 I mean the highlighting stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0081352_0082292 Actually for any text area, whatever it is, they define some handy highlights on that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082292_0082443 So you've got different highlights.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082443_0082847 just look at what they wrote about it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0082847_0083407 They've got user highlights, selection highlights, time highlights.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083564_0083648 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0083866_0084550 So you can quite easily, if your text area is called area, you just do area dot set highlights or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084550_0084615 你来啦
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0084903_0085417 That's the way I did it to highlight, to cross highlight, to topic and transquits.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0085647_0085685 감사합니다.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091133_0091466 But if you don't know it, I'd like to dance with you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0091466_0092196 Hey, oh yeah, I've got all this space you can do this all. And then as it goes, oh no!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092196_0092783 Is it talking now? I'm just saying. So nice machine again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0092912_0093190 I spent too much time for another.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093287_0093764 Alright, well I've been doing some random pop-up windows for the speaker characterization which is good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093764_0093949 So, feel better now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0093949_0094239 The windows are all there now after lots of food.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094447_0094830 Well, you know, just the pop-up one. The pop-up. It's difficult, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0094830_0095852 because it basically has to set up like 10 pop-up windows in memory as in already initialized them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0095852_0097625 because there might be 10 speakers. Now all have to have different windows. And I'm working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the topics of the meetings that topic was mentioned in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0097625_0098398 And I have a question about the... said we wanted to start screening.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098398_0098686 What kind of starts rend it when you want?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0098686_0099910 I mean do we want some general blood about welcome to the browser or something? It's an SD browser. Some speech and some music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0099910_0100194 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0101016_0101819 So do we want... Yeah, maybe we could write on like that, whatever it's called, the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0102824_0103036 Yum, how?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103036_0103596 I mean at the moment the way is it's a drop-down menu as you see. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0103596_0104380 with all that. And that because it's the dialogue class that you use there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105197_0105814 I mean, I think they should have two options, either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0105814_0106146 And through that, once you've got the results, click on something. Stupid NFT.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106641_0106681 Is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0106846_0106986 The only thing he can search is a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0109093_0109356 Can you not get this non-object?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0110808_0111239 I meant we wouldn't want to use... Yeah, we wouldn't want to use NXT beginning anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111239_0111597 because we don't want to search locally.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0111597_0111799 Say... Say...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112036_0112390 Well no, then they would open the meeting first, right? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0112390_0113079 So let's say you have two options, either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0114980_0115106 Never mind, we won't default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0115106_0115222 Cześć!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117710_0117866 Yeah, but low.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0117866_0118149 We can do levels of trying.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118149_0118201 Prima!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0118903_0119072 Yeah, so we're getting a... the logical...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0119572_0120392 But yeah, the global inverted file search gives the norm objects basically to the local search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0120772_0120979 Well yeah, that's always going to be the case with Switch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0127554_0128257 I mean you can, you know, the option is to do a search in a way that, if you do a global search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128257_0128525 First and first I've only returned meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0128525_0129236 as in not even meetings but the name of the meetings. So you know say you want to search for the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129236_0129671 then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0129671_0130137 and then you can decide, well I want to search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting or...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0131846_0131917 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0133484_0134502 There is a string in one of the papers they have names.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0134502_0135159 even better understandings
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135159_0135296 That's a working group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0135328_0135540 Okay, I want to...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136130_0136376 So, yeah, I've put that in already too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136513_0136562 Let's go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0136797_0137361 So yeah again concretely to the startup, startup, whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0138687_0138799 What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139654_0139748 Yeah, how is that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0139748_0140090 I mean, do you think you'd have time for that as well?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0143830_0144030 It would have been like a list of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0146883_0147426 So the general score would that be it for the whole of the language or the whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the... The whole of the
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0147621_0147931 No!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148152_0148272 do local.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0148571_0149086 So what would the, if we had these face topics, what would they look like? That's key words.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149086_0149296 Bunch. That's really easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0149296_0149507 Just don't listen. Like, see words or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0150892_0151721 Because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151721_0151946 Because if you just have the segmentation, that's great.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0151946_0152612 but we can't compare it to the hand annotated, hand segmented tool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154848_0154929 Yeah, I'm like...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0154929_0155000 I'll be very nice.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0157347_0157497 No, nie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158504_0158755 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Do we need to?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158755_0158866 or just look at...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0158866_0158946 I just...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159488_0159909 It was sort of, but the main idea was more like to speed up, speed the search up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0159909_0160355 because NXT over the whole corpus was just not feeling good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160355_0160440 That went slow down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0160737_0161085 No, but the general inverted vowel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161085_0161177 It still uses a
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161177_0161402 Yes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161402_0161533 That would just be nice extra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0161826_0162209 Ja, albo z nimi. To był ja, zanim dodał mnie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162322_0162464 I'm gonna get you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0162464_0162631 So, what? It's only into...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163367_0163566 Yeah, I mean, if you have time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163566_0163798 今から始まるよ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0163798_0164155 Because I mean then it would give you like if you search for work
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164155_0164659 it will give you the meetings but also how often that word occurred in that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164659_0164887 That would be so useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0164944_0164998 Oh, wait.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0165287_0165337 Nie, nie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166254_0166691 Yeah, but it will be useful. How informative, that TFIDF is an informative school.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0166691_0167133 If you search for language and you return like...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0167133_0167654 basically all of the meetings. You want to see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169068_0169150 Black Virgin.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0169607_0169964 サニーデース!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171103_0171347 And then I'll close up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171347_0171413 Because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0171413_0171547 The thing is that he can't...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0184287_0185068 So, come back with the dark screen. Oh, okay. Sort of. I'm very unsure about what it actually looked like.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185068_0185739 I mean, we want it for the part where you can choose the meeting. What kind of information do you want to have about the meeting?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0185739_0186339 I mean the longer name obviously if there is one because they don't all have long names
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186339_0186624 What, the user's that's fake?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186624_0186781 Use that to help.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0186781_0187146 Then that's pretty much the same for the same group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187463_0187523 e acerto.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0187875_0188443 Yeah, just to give them an idea, a general idea of what there is, so they can pick a soup.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190217_0190360 Yeah, oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0190360_0191168 Rwy'n gwybod i'r gweithio y ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddysgu'r ddys
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191168_0191313 I want that first meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0191313_0191358 バッ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193761_0193944 I'm a nigga for that now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0193944_0194339 Because we just want to have a way of, you know...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0194339_0195069 Because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting, they can browse through that quite nicely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0196708_0196761 What do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197378_0197509 Oh, how are we gonna do that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0197755_0197983 They can have it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198418_0198689 But that would defy the whole point of browsing, right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198689_0198979 If you only need one, just look. Well, alright, call it favourites then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0198979_0199684 Yeah. You can have a favorite. Okay. Just scroll down the list and find your favorite one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0199684_0200295 Yeah, it's not enough emulation. It's not like they come back every day and do the same thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0200295_0200898 I forgot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0201511_0201565 네
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0203619_0203867 Should we turn it off? Alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0204433_0204785 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205023_0205757 I wasn't going to put any help in there, any sort of explanation of how the Ravza works to be honest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0205757_0205864 Dobrze, serdecznie.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207091_0207139 Nothing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0207616_0207937 But I mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208152_0208271 Yeah, we'll search, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0208271_0208431 even if it's just too thick.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0209821_0210117 Yeah, that all happens through the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210117_0210615 Basically either the user knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just cooks on it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0210615_0211023 or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213265_0213415 अवाशी विए ज़ेख सरी
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0213415_0213551 E me segue a disser, gente.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0215327_0215467 Yeah, that's that's what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216096_0216266 Yeah, that one's about right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216266_0216811 ..y'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0216811_0217577 the drop down menu but we want all the information about the name the longer you want the users
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217577_0217646 Well, we don't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0217863_0218569 Maybe if they're near the codes and in other corvus
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0219105_0219240 drop down music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220084_0220230 Yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0220271_0220456 Then, yeah, that's it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0221530_0222119 No, no, no, I'm not saying you can pick a user, but it should come up with some list.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222119_0222777 but an extended list of the meetings. So you have BDR, whatever it is called, 0-1.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0222777_0223344 and then it gives you the longer name blah blah and then it gives you the participants
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223637_0223889 No te...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0223959_0224134 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224134_0224316 But then... Is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224316_0224556 No, it's not at all, I think. I told her.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224556_0224692 It's all that we have.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224692_0224950 I've not tried that yet but that's good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0224950_0225317 ¡Muchas gracias!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225317_0225963 Yeah, I'm not sure. Is that very... Is that not annoying? If you have to? Get out of the belly way!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0225963_0226273 おしゃべり
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226273_0226386 I did that a lot, didn't I?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226386_0226994 You know, to search for a specific user, you have to hold your mouse over that one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0226994_0227437 wait for it to pop up. Yeah, that's the way. But that's why you can
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0229882_0230290 It would just be nice to have some basic information on. Yeah, well you can have a textbox there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230290_0230807 Yeah, thinking about that updates. Yeah, as you go over there. Then that doesn't get any less likely in the way.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230807_0230954 Я мамина собесадили.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0230954_0231487 So you've got a drop down menu, a search button, not search, go to them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0231713_0231788 And then...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232000_0232366 some sort of feels which updates done actually depending on what you've highlighted.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0232710_0232798 There, that's what's going to happen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0233635_0233667 See?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234346_0234496 What is normal? I just not thought.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0234696_0234930 Oh, yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235811_0235971 Right after music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0235971_0236358 You've got lots of non-something and then night-something and then end-something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0236758_0236869 One's an interface of one's own.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238062_0238529 And most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you've got to update this Jonathan.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238529_0238836 This is unintelligible.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0238898_0239158 Right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0240763_0241021 Yeah, they don't do anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241021_0241212 It's not very fun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0241212_0241619 Right, so anyone else got anything to say?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0242119_0242579 Do we want another meeting at the end of the week?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243033_0243115 Yes, no.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243115_0243612 I mean, I think I'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week, so I'll have probably more to talk about.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0243817_0243898 great
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244842_0244907 if you like
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0244907_0245123 We can just discuss that Friday if you have...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0245675_0245756 What's wrong?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0247755_0248019 I've got a doctor's appointment at 10 to 2.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0250419_0250544 수위
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251067_0251106 now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0251571_0252344 If one's bad for you then we won't have any. No, that would only give us like 35 minutes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252344_0252592 What? What? What? What? What?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0252592_0252753 like five or six.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0253117_0253282 More three o'clock, let's see.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0254517_0254873 I'll write this meeting up and I'll send it to him in the mail as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0255359_0256031 because she's not here. No, I'm in that she's collecting. Oh right, oh yeah, sorry. Yeah, it's cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256031_0256612 Collecting something! I thought somebody was collecting them but that's what I thought we needed
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0256612_0256834 We should probably do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257021_0257501 So can we just repeat briefly what I was hoping about?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0257501_0258117 So we've then done a progress on the speaker characterization. Who does the speaker characterization?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258117_0258709 We mentioned topic labeling with keywords.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0258709_0259136 Ym...wydysbysigwyd ysgrifennu yn ymweld.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0259136_0259489 And Martha, did you have anything?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260473_0260541 Please do it again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0260848_0261428 Well, basically not unless you've got time for it then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0261428_0261548 Boy, that's the end.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263546_0263744 I think you were. How so?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0263885_0264236 I think it would give you the most relevant result.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0265828_0266434 No, but for things like if you search for language, then you might have some topics which have as a...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0266434_0267224 You know, some meetings which have, as a topic, language, they specifically speak about language and they use that word like in every sentence.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267224_0267660 And then you've got those that just mention it briefly, like once or twice saying.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0267660_0268069 You know, my language is German or something stupid. But you don't really want.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268069_0268282 So you want to extinguish that somehow?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268282_0268379 Or come down to us anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0268695_0268792 We are easel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269326_0269623 Not all terms, we can just do something. I need to see them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0269623_0269691 Rummy!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272028_0272402 Tak, tak, tak, tak.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272402_0272761 Yeah, I mean, you just do it very simply, you know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0272761_0273228 We'll have to talk to Pranil about this. Yeah, because they're COG's, so...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0273228_0273333 Because we are using Adam.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274023_0274217 It doesn't have to be all intelligent.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0274503_0274584 Ya, no.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281142_0281256 Pues no, también, y...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0281256_0281671 Yeah, they're all dissent. But they're all 75 meeting. Is that really? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283154_0283256 네.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0283612_0284081 It would be useful if I thought of words like language that might occur in all of them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284081_0284542 but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0284934_0285207 You know, you still want to be able to search for the word language.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285410_0285498 Answer.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_FEO072_0285850_0286022 We will discuss it again on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0002306_0002541 Does it squeeze in? Like that? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0005698_0005937 Ik heb geen voorzikel van u gehad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0009179_0009353 Sen de eksiği tutuyorsun.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0010398_0010516 So have a good one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017338_0017486 That I want to do well actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0017486_0018262 The data processing is fine but I don't particularly want to do the GUI for it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018262_0018397 No, not really.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0018397_0019186 If you want to do that then tell me how you want the data presented
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019186_0019778 is that the moment I've created two classes one for us to speak as
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0019778_0020295 ond yw'r ysgol yw'r gweithio, ac y ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud yn y ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020295_0020877 ac mae'n ddweud o'r objex ac mae'n ddweud o'r objex o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0020877_0021528 Felly, y byddai'r byddai yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch, a'r byddai'n gwybod, ac mae'r byddai'r byddai yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021528_0021812 So there's two separate classes to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021812_0021965 and they're two different objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0021965_0022709 ac mae'n gweithio'r obiect ac mae'n gweithio'r obiect ac mae'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ymdweithio'r obiect yn ym
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0022709_0023131 ac nid yw'n cael meffas o'r maen nhw'n gwybod ychydig yn ymlaen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023131_0023532 or everything but that's why I want to know what's the easiest way to have the data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0023891_0024199 Yeah, basically, you'll kind of have to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024199_0024593 and all store those objects. So that object files. Alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0024593_0025389 ac mae'n ddweud y gallwn i'r ddweud y nôl yn ymddiolol ac mae'n ddweud y ddweud y ddweud a'r ddweud y ddweud a'r ddweud y llyfr yn ymddiol, yn ymddiol, yn ymddiol, yn ymddiol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025463_0025733 and then all these cool ones are turned to pop that window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0025733_0026149 But that's what I want to tell you how, what format do you want the data to come back in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026149_0026783 Because it can come back as... what's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0026783_0026961 Это смело, да?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0028239_0028328 Yeah, can you kill-
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0029102_0030576 So, as I can have it so that it returns you a... As at the moment, the main data structures are hash tables for the meetings that say it's got one that says percent, it's called percent talk.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030576_0030860 1% noise and 1% participation.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030860_0030913 Two seven.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0030913_0031695 So then it's got inside, it's got a link, it's got the speaker's name and then it's got their percentage for that thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0031695_0032375 So you can either come back as a... you can have the hashtag or you can have it returned as a vector and it will say noise.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032375_0032689 Mae'r rhan o'r rhan o'r niw, o'r x%
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032689_0032977 We will say a vector that's cool, I don't know, whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0032977_0033810 You can either have a like an embedded vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0033810_0034240 What the easiest thing to do is how you want to display it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0034640_0034795 Yeah, he's all the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0035962_0036317 So that's the cake. How do we channel it like that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0036622_0037082 It's in that format that's people
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037082_0037710 The speaker is the controlling thing, not...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0037768_0038191 Felly, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae'r ddysgu, mae
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038191_0038361 Yeah, that's easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038361_0038476 So, I think that was amazing actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038476_0038941 the influences of living in Germany for six months don't know if that had any effect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0038941_0039137 Ysbyty mae'r dda i'n ddweud yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039137_0039381 No, è stato pesato!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039381_0039876 Why do these people cover us?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0039876_0040167 So then do all that's calculated as well.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040167_0040336 or after this get the dialogue.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0040336_0040428 To jest no testing na piosk.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041434_0041734 So then, how is this box populated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0041734_0041973 Does it populate by the one present or the one highlighted?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042237_0042339 the one present.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0042950_0043546 Mae'r methu yn ymwneud yw'r ffordd yma, mae'r ffordd yn ymwneud yw'r ffordd yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0043546_0044062 So that's what President says, like, get talk time. And he takes a name.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044062_0044474 So that we call that, we call the meetings method that's able to turn that
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044474_0044823 and that would pop you like that, which would be an easy thing to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0044823_0045043 Can you sing for that? I mean that would do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046352_0046390 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0046899_0047044 É, é tão easy, é.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047199_0047239 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047239_0047777 So I'll just leave in lots of methods that just return one number at a time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0047777_0048030 That would be the easiest way to do it. Yeah, definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048030_0048200 Okay, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0048700_0048948 gets old time, I think it's called.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049571_0049713 No, this door is an object for...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0049713_0050140 prices are far off line and they are much smaller
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050140_0050561 There's only like a 1k. So that's all just preprocessed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050561_0050671 Yes, it will be consistent.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050671_0050993 ac mae'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0050993_0051116 you have to re-create the object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051116_0051305 It's got a low method.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051305_0051769 Yn ymwneud, yw'r cyfnodd yn fwyaf ar gyfer y cyfnodd yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0051769_0052052 He does offend us all the price of singing stores is on the ground.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052052_0052355 and then if you call it an oil constructor.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052355_0052804 Then you can call the loader, you can call the loader, whatever one or all of them or anything like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0052804_0052879 Gewöhnlist.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053397_0053633 One object for each meeting. I want to meet him.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053683_0053812 不再演演
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0053812_0053941 ただ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054355_0054561 It just tells you who participated.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0054561_0055144 Yn y moment y gallwn y gallwn y gallwn yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwneud yn ymwne
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055391_0055574 Yeah, yeah, that would be very easy.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0055903_0056071 Ja, dat had ik niet gezien.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056071_0056435 Felly, mae'r bwysig yn cael ei wneud o'r ffordd y byddai'r ffordd yn ymdweud y byddai'r ffordd yn cael ei wneud o'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056752_0056795 Ay ay ay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0056795_0057141 No tossing specified, yeah, I have default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057141_0057373 There are some deep of hot nuns actually.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0057373_0057710 You know, a lot of people thank you for your inch, right? And all the stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0058924_0059029 Yeah, yeah, the problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059029_0059346 and then you can do a search over the meetings, over the objects.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059346_0059579 Because that's the thing, these are so small.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0059579_0060210 Mae'r cyllid yn ymweld i'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddwe
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0060210_0060321 So it doesn't crush the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061027_0061353 What, the GLAM statistics come straight off of that, don't they?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061353_0061562 Because they just for the meat, the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0061822_0062225 The speaker class knows about all of that stuff. And the meeting class knows about that stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0062858_0063016 На, на, вато я и тебе.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063289_0063528 what we want here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0063528_0063805 I thought the other stuff was more important than anyone, so I did that first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064279_0064838 Yn ymwneud yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yw'r yw'r ysgol yw'r yw'r ysgol yw'r yw'r yw'r y
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0064838_0065272 it. The object's serial number is strange and you can't really lie to the object so all the rest of the thing has to be done over again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065272_0065398 and I'm quite finished with it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065605_0065949 It would become a sink and get a bit funny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0065949_0066289 If I gave you one, if I gave you it now and you worked on it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066289_0066787 and then I changed it and ran the thing again, you wouldn't have been able to load the objects by yourself. I would say.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0066787_0067293 .. and you'd have to and then you'd have multiple copies of multiple copies of objects or other places to get to see the thing I think
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0067637_0068265 But if you want to make a picture, you can do that without anything. What do you mean a picture?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068265_0068459 Just that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068459_0068569 Yeah, but it's not gonna take
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0068569_0068860 Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069110_0069420 Why would I take so long to get it in the first place?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069420_0069766 But I need to untie all this stuff too first.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0069766_0069924 because otherwise the object wouldn't be the same.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0070656_0070793 Bye, some way or another.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071077_0071212 معانيسة كاوي
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0071212_0071434 Voi să finesc acolo de glas.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089041_0089444 That way it doesn't crash, you try like rotating one crash and it doesn't...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0089444_0090063 It's a bit dumb if you can fool it, if you load up ten different engines simultaneously.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090063_0090305 It can do that five, three, two, one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090305_0090583 I can't do them if it takes everyone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0090583_0091142 because it's about the amount that you have to call a new class and then it will do it fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091142_0091801 But if you'd like me to... Yeah, he says, okay, oh yeah, I've got a whisper, he's cutting himself.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091801_0091884 안녕하십니까
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0091884_0092582 Is it toting now?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0092582_0093326 So nice machine again. You've spent too much time following it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094276_0094351 No, wydarla.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094351_0094424 Et enfin tout.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094645_0094693 D'accord, papa.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0094693_0094753 It's difficult.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099083_0099438 It's the MSD browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0099438_0100082 some speech and some music. It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0101925_0102381 or a switchboard that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102381_0102717 Let me a meeting, let me a search, let me something else.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0102717_0102797 We're so cheap.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0105945_0106173 Click on something stupid in there T-shirts
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106173_0106536 It needs you to have a meeting later before you start doing any searching until it does.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0106774_0107296 The only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you load it and observe it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0107942_0108922 Which means you could use the inverted file search to return a list of meetings and then use one of those to load and search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0108922_0109064 Под любовь!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109368_0109743 It has to be an observation and even if you go and search the whole corpus from there
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0109743_0110080 But you have to have, it has to start with something for some bizarre reason.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110080_0110675 The engine, there's only one search method to the search engine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0110675_0110886 The engine class and it has one of such
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0111483_0111596 Yeah, check out the link.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118131_0118293 It doesn't really get long to lie down anyway.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0118293_0118486 We can light it down when it doesn't have a heat
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0120372_0120433 Second
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121092_0121255 But he gives one at a time anyway, doesn't he?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0121255_0121388 Because otherwise you crushed the thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0124992_0125139 It's not too slow though.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125139_0125328 It's not too bad, isn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125328_0125523 But that thing now, yeah, same as with the blue.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0125866_0125936 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130214_0130271 Dare you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130271_0130817 Mae'r ffordd yn ymddi'r llwynt yn ymddi'r llwynt, ac mae'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddwe
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0130817_0130921 These are the notions.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132245_0132471 Did we think about...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0132681_0132824 better names for the meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134197_0134354 I did it, I did it, really trust that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134607_0134666 To the next.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134666_0134793 Okay, that's a bit of a problem.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0134793_0134875 Biorąc się i zająć.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135077_0135305 That's a working group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0135332_0135852 I want to see the meetings about very, very better, I understand.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0136433_0136556 Okay, let's go with this one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138033_0138314 So who would have the ideas?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138314_0138521 I mean the D.F.'s.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0138521_0138764 Document Freakens in the Switch world.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139058_0139344 Yeah, today I'm what, to escape talking about you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0139344_0139509 To do the topic, no.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0140243_0140790 If somebody's done the keyfix or the idea of the DFS already wouldn't be enough to probably...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143073_0143304 How do you do an inverted file search without the CFID?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0143503_0144032 I think it needs that. It would have been like a wish, though.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144032_0144273 yng Nghymru yn ymddi'r cyfnod o'r ddodol.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0144273_0145030 Basically the amount the DF is the document frequency is the amount that each word occurs. No, what is it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0145030_0146188 term frequency is the amount that it occurs. One of them is the amount that occurs in each document and the other one is the amount that occurs generally.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0146188_0146938 So the more it occurs in specific documents compared to its general score, the better and more informative it is about the certain.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147303_0147608 The fuck you call cross the call? I just feel a data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0147937_0148548 Plus a stop list so you remove stuff that doesn't like that and then which is going to have a basically equal score
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148743_0148810 his face top.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0148964_0149212 Bwys cwyddiad? Bwys.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149212_0149416 Yeah, for anything you could just a listen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149416_0149507 Keywords
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149507_0149838 Yeah, keep those clothes, clothes, trust us. What's the eye into your failure?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149838_0149964 Inverse, to ok.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0149964_0150187 We have time for you to see my best token friends.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0150429_0150823 I did do it once, I do have a job class that does it for something, I don't know whether it was in all areas.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0152722_0153001 You also have key words to give you an all new type of search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153001_0153109 You got to be kidding me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153109_0153454 but you could do keyword search, could be topics search, couldn't it? Could be the same thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0153454_0154048 Ystodd, mae'n ddweud y cwyddiad, mae'n ddweud y teimlo i'r ddweud y teimlo i'r ddweud y teimlo i'r ddweud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0154203_0154315 Please, please, don't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0155341_0156222 But Spicer, even calculating the voice his face is themselves, it's too normal.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0156222_0157189 The easy bits, it's probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole characters in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157189_0157624 Because you don't have to integrate as much. Yeah, definitely. Information.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0157973_0158359 No, you can do search without TFID if you just can't rank the search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0158970_0159494 No, no, no, but that's not what the idea was in the first place, these ranked results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160264_0160488 Yeah, but that might slide down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0160488_0160600 ranking once again.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161107_0161604 It still uses a little bit of fiber, it ranks the results by the amount of fiber. That would just be nice extra.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0161604_0161818 I thought that was part of it, but yeah, okay, doesn't it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162242_0162710 No, we didn't. So, what? Is there any interview?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0162977_0163392 But yeah, I guess if that's not part of it, then I worry about it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0163561_0163750 Because I'm only going to do this one time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164726_0164813 We just give you a break.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0164813_0165282 That was the whole point. No, no, actually, because I mean, this is your top one, this is your bottom.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166295_0166492 That's it, that's how informative it is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0166492_0166721 That TFIDF is in infomity schools.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0167959_0168230 It's not a good idea to do this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0168416_0168525 不 like what
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169308_0169412 That's a compelling one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169412_0169892 はぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁはぁ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0169892_0170033 And I can't actually tell you yet.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170303_0170774 It's my simple form, it will do a separate rank for each one, each turn.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0170774_0171163 You could make it more complicated and make it... It's not making my company.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0171523_0171710 The way we were just looking for
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172042_0172133 Well that's way worth it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0172133_0172283 Ja, die tau we.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0173224_0174008 I guess I just do some of the individual TFIDF for each term returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174008_0174408 and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174408_0174774 and the higher, the more informative each term is for each thing. Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0174957_0175023 Happy New Year!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175023_0175228 It's pretty crude anyway, this is looking for...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175414_0175908 If it's all it's gonna do is look for separate... Oh, because then it's gonna go into the NXT session, and turn nine to it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0175908_0176137 Or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176137_0176267 Yeah, yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176267_0176403 So yeah, that's this group.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0176403_0176608 Um
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177487_0177584 Groups are tough.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0177584_0178053 Yeah, without doing any like, um, word pairs. We're also like two
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0178851_0179386 Yeah, that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179386_0179709 That's um... yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179709_0179940 But the only idea is that gives you new form with your score.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0179940_0180210 how you combine that is up to you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180210_0180351 I guess it does not say that it's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180351_0180980 If you were worried about this there's a whole lot about it in Manning and Schubert
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0180980_0181393 They've got a whole chunk about it, so just high-high on this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181393_0181581 Eu sei que não tem mais chato aqui.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181581_0181729 There's got to be a good chance of winning.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0181729_0181889 If you haven't got it, some code in it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182495_0182581 Yes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0182581_0182878 One that's a figures.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0187627_0187906 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188687_0188748 いや、ごめん。
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0188748_0188875 Yeah, I guess that's fish.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0197880_0198070 They can have it safe preferences.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198070_0198284 Can I have a side-press up for a second?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0198795_0199338 Well, call it favourite still.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199338_0199448 You can't have a fight with this!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0199722_0200105 Yeah, it's not enough in relation is it? Not like they come back every day and do the same.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0201502_0201561 對 歡迎
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0204803_0204956 Yeah, it would be quite a bit harsier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0205719_0206009 That's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying, like, these are
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207456_0207592 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0207592_0207657 David.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208096_0208257 The search. Yeah, the search, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208257_0208441 So even if it just had two things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208441_0208990 Ie ddim yn ymwneud yw'r ysgolwch yn ymwneud i'r ysgolwch yn ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r ymwneud i'r
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0208990_0209204 And then another one that said search that like is if
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209204_0209467 like a session like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0209594_0209856 Yeah, or one night. Yeah, one night.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211013_0211248 All the other things there is just how it searches the default.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211248_0211482 just the ovens and the search wind ovens.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0211482_0211798 And that's the interface. You just go from there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212121_0212516 ac nid ydy'r brwser o'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd i'r ffordd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0212516_0213348 Or the search, but the search window I could have on it, something that said just has a drop down menu that says just an a go button that said take me to this. Oh I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213348_0213571 तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0213571_0214400 So the only thing that comes up when you finish is a, when you start, it's just one window like that. And it's got all the search stuff right down there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214400_0214615 So this is your search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0214615_0215164 It's just all here. And here it's just go to wherever. I'm gonna go by them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215164_0215514 And then from there it takes you to wherever it is. Yeah, that's what, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0215704_0216048 And the other topic says welcome to our browser.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0216813_0216963 Dobra, idziemy do razu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217344_0217656 Ah, you won. Bye.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0217831_0217942 That's kind of...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0218438_0218515 Yes, too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219079_0219129 以上
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0219733_0220248 This is beautiful. If you want to search your search, if you want to look for one meeting and just look at it. Yeah, that's fine.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220248_0220721 That's true. That's always you have to
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0220721_0221165 One is one there, but we've got two, one amazing one to see.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221165_0221415 Go and you can do it, you can go, go, go, go, go for the other.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221415_0221477 Gar nicht.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0221477_0221637 Nu är det nu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0223369_0224053 You can do Microsoft study and hold it over and it pops up a thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224202_0224302 Is that complicated?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0224883_0225023 Massive, risen angels.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225023_0225259 やっちりねさぁ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0225832_0226409 Get out of the bloody way, I'm trying to step to the limit! Yes! I did do that a lot, didn't I?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227076_0227367 Ja, das sind wir.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227367_0227691 But that's why you could just have a list of your users then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0227691_0227942 And Jesse just say I want to look for this season.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228029_0228112 안녕
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228112_0228471 If I mean, then it pulls up a list of all the ones who got that newsroom.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228471_0228698 And then you search, then... But then you search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0228698_0229192 Maybe just leave it, just have them leading names there. And don't worry about the speakers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229192_0229367 If they didn't speak, is it doing such?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0229367_0229594 It's not the same. It's doing a quick access.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230146_0230659 Or you can have a text box there that's got... Thinking about that, updates. Yeah, as you go over there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0230659_0230821 Then that doesn't get any worse like you know what I mean.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0232469_0232617 the full name and then speak it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233013_0233294 We can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233465_0233505 I think.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233723_0233769 Cool.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233769_0233929 I think... No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0233929_0234025 他們已經很動了
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0234538_0234956 I think it's an object model.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235175_0235508 Yeah, it is your right, it's the right covers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235508_0235796 the night right corpus and then you got night right element
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0235796_0236117 You're not right actually, it's a...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0236408_0237040 I think the N1s are interfaces and the N1, one of the waves around ones are interfaces and ones actually are an implemented class.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237040_0237498 Because if you go back enough, I think, um, what's his name?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237498_0237773 The API is alright but there's not a lot of description in it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237773_0237959 Yeah, it's very great.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0237959_0238103 Says he won't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239098_0239480 So yeah, that was just a set of returns there. In... text... box.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239480_0239560 So, okay, what's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0239583_0240106 It's an implementation of an N text interface.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240106_0240169 What's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0240169_0241198 Alright sir, extended version of it. Oh, stop it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0242760_0242869 Not useful, man.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0243694_0243809 Ja się tak mógłbym to wymaść.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0244908_0245011 I've waked this net
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246177_0246362 ...just off the ... SPT?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0246973_0247021 네
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247021_0247144 But that means the right amount.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247460_0247646 You're the first one. Pull it out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0247646_0247742 Yeah, that can be funny.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248492_0248785 Good morning!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0248940_0248994 Thanks everybody.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249148_0249215 A très à l'heure !
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0249215_0249491 Mais il y a des gammes norts, chauds, rien de casseux.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0250517_0250815 So we say for a clock and then if there's a serious road mark.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252439_0252628 Smile at me, I'm with you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0252792_0252904 Free for the folks.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253216_0253648 It's just great size size 3rd clove and then it doesn't bother me that much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0253648_0254165 then history can't solve the problem, five to six will be a problem. People might be here.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254165_0254342 Dat gaat uit die gang wel mee.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0254982_0255215 Is she collecting? No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255215_0255501 You just sent it to her, so... Because she's not here?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0255501_0255898 I'm in the chocolate team. Oh right, okay, sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256003_0256253 It's cool for the gift. It's like, it's a meeting something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256327_0256480 I thought somebody was connecting them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256480_0256648 Well that's what I thought when you said that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0256898_0257262 So we know who's missed them. So we just...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268426_0268832 Yeah, that would help. And that's for singles. For singles. To have it with the very usual. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0268832_0269419 for multiple terms unless you want to do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0269767_0270631 Well you can do it and override it by the... you can just ignore the ranking if it doesn't show up together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0270631_0270975 Or you could have you computerize it you could just spot a way to do this
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271207_0271446 Yeah, you do the energy research and it doesn't sound together
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271446_0271683 Either disregard it or put a weight in your death.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0271683_0271921 So how many pairs you got?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272131_0272336 Nie, to zanim gdzieś...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0272981_0273098 Jeg har ikke lyst til at...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274286_0274539 Because something's you're going to get a lot of results.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274539_0274873 And if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom, then it was actually the most relevant one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0274873_0275008 Something was also...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276454_0276627 This is the hard issue. Okay, let's see now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0276627_0277014 And also, with that Sunday
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277014_0277640 The... If Sunny and they aren't mentioned together a lot but Sunny just has some questions once.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277640_0277942 that its term will be lower and it will push down the other one if you combine them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0277942_0278075 Vi siktade inte.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279124_0279167 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279167_0279738 But you have no ranking system at the moment so if something is an amazing, highly ranked thing from the TF5 yet
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0279738_0280798 It could just be ignored because it falls off the bottom of the... I can assume you have to return all results for all... Say you type language and it returns 75 meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281067_0281627 I don't know what weeks it was. It was not something he did. Yeah, they're all dissent. But they're all 75 meetings. Is that really? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281627_0281677 Ya, eso.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0281996_0282399 Felly, mae'r rhaid i'r 75, mae'r ymdweud yn ymdweud?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282399_0282559 How do you rank them or something?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0282559_0283107 Well, it has 20, and it has 20, do you cut it off at 10, do you rank them, do you? No, it's true. Okay. What's the threshold?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283107_0283196 time
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283425_0283566 Eu acho que ele não morreu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0283566_0283669 What happened?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287489_0287536 Is that it?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0287733_0287945 Ich bin tick.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE071_0288070_0288203 Time to hurry.

AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0006711_0006820 네
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0010769_0011623 One thing that I was wondering is there standard control that you use to connect the different things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0011623_0012020 like you're in the topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012020_0012646 Is there a particular type of control that like is one of these NXT or something? Night controls?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0012646_0012722 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0015854_0016228 You haven't had to build any new windows to do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016228_0016669 like other topics where we're going to do it for speaker ideas and all the rest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016669_0016708 Well
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0016779_0017338 Well, okay, um... When we talk about speaker characterization, how are we accessing the list of speakers?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026808_0026979 Ja, ik ben er ook niet mee.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0026979_0027329 Like when he was talking about like how an architecture that things are gonna plug into. Yeah
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027329_0027798 I mean, so that things are all modular. I mean, it would be a good idea for you to have the same idea for anything else we do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027798_0027954 What else are we doing?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0027954_0028342 Yeah, actually even the searches or whatever, you know, just, yeah, kind of sort of things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0028342_0028849 I mean search results are a predictable thing with a name, certain properties are listed properly in the back of your hand.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0033745_0033849 Je ne m'en fous à rien.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034053_0034342 How do you want to discipline it? I mean, I can do it, no?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0034378_0034788 It just mattered deciding what we'd be obsessed with. Yeah, he's it all the way around.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049224_0049723 So each time you're going straight to the XML files for the information? No, I store it as an object file.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049723_0049757 맛있..
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049757_0049850 I'm not offline
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049850_0049965 どうぞ、ご視聴ありがとうございました
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0049965_0050004 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050258_0050422 without 1k
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0050422_0050663 So that's all just pre-processed? Yeah, it's all pre-processed.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051309_0051345 the way
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0051959_0052044 Right.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0052811_0053116 This is it. Is it for the entire corpus?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053116_0053476 Or is it just like individual ones? Like one object for... One object for each me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053476_0053540 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053540_0053686 아무것도 모르겠는데
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0053919_0054132 I wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054132_0054324 Huh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054355_0054385 C'est...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0054871_0054911 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0056609_0057022 Or just return an all or a... Oh yeah, no, it's just a specific idea how to default, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0060208_0060258 セットスクリーム
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071484_0071909 Actually, I cannot plug my stuff as well. I just have to make one change to your phone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0071909_0072240 Just to load this one instead of the default. Alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0072240_0072566 So, it's two lines of cord. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073070_0073163 Oh, what do you mean?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0073336_0073698 Well, yeah, just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074114_0074311 more your version of it
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074427_0074693 I did it in my directory. Just do it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0074876_0075176 I have a copy, yes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075176_0075245 I'm dance.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0075245_0075906 But I was going to update them, it just makes sense that... Well just tell when, because I usually...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076114_0076300 and then update.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076547_0076744 Yeah, you have a million changes too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076744_0076902 OK
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0076902_0077102 I'll just make that one in the chair.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077311_0077597 Because, like I said, two wins are good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0077597_0078132 Komm, dann bin ich im Brei.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078132_0078233 There's not much to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078233_0078625 I have to get better results like better
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0078938_0079543 Yeah, and just to wiring the topics and do them in some ways.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0079543_0080115 So... I mean, the highlighting stuff. Well, also, yeah, like that. That is one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080115_0080211 네, 네.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080297_0080874 just want to find what kind of logic those were that for the others.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0080874_0081304 So, because you don't have it, because that's... Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0082326_0082359 Panu.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085593_0085681 Okay, sounds good.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0085892_0086548 Okay, there's a few more things to do with that. And then once Penelope gets the index
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086548_0086820 Dann hast du mir die Kanne von...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0086820_0087170 I was just wondering if you had to... Well, the way you were doing it, I was going to ask if the way you were doing it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087170_0087588 You're reloading like a new corpus each time for your training, but you're doing the object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0087588_0088289 So you don't need to just because if we do have like the inverted search says that there's young
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0088289_0089001 time document so we're gonna have to load each of these 10 corp corp corp just to do the individual next next user
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0089380_0089533 Yeah, they probably...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090150_0090373 Fine. Seriously?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090373_0090406 See you then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0090860_0091294 If you have to call a new class and then it will do it fine, but if you don't know it, I don't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091294_0091408 That's insane.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0091738_0092049 안녕
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0093795_0093898 e sovarena.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099112_0099725 More women. It's an SD browser. Some speeches of music.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099725_0099959 Bye!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0099959_0100154 It doesn't take too long.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100154_0100590 We have to, you know, while we're debugging.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0100590_0100987 But now we're something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103440_0103544 Oui.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0103783_0103949 And that because
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104515_0104905 I just can ask if we should assume that they'll want to load a meeting first but not necessarily
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0104905_0105239 I guess if you're doing a search on the entire yeah, I mean
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0105765_0105892 感受到
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0106555_0106792 Well, we can. Does it? Oh, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107270_0107714 I keep it all even. That shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0107714_0107884 And if it hasn't loaded, then force it to load it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111723_0111938 Honestly, I know what meaning it is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0111938_0112083 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0113546_0114127 Well, the things I mean, just be looking for a word and, you know, like if it shows up at ten different meetings.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114127_0114868 Then at that point they'll probably want to... Like, do we want to, like, stick it up by default, goes with the first one and they want number five up for the ones that are returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0114868_0114978 Do zobaczenia.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115184_0115431 Well, I'm like, too old. Like, the thing is, I think...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0115580_0116003 Like when it loads up, it loads up the transcript window in the window.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116003_0116206 Right now I think just the topic goes.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116206_0116826 Although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0116826_0117456 So I'm just thinking if it's kind of like you're saying you have to have a normal object, right?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117456_0117835 I mean, before you do, insert your own little search.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117876_0117953 Can't do that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0117953_0118007 更帅
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118453_0118825 Yeah, but the global one feeds into the local.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0118825_0119318 So if we're getting any usable data, it's going to be doing a search on each of those files.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0119318_0119664 So it's going to be loading up each of those at a time to get the day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0120470_0120896 But it could be time consuming, like if there are 10 documents that... Well yeah, that's always going to be the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121424_0121743 Um, yeah, I'm just thinking of some way we could, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0121743_0122317 catch the results in a nice little format that'll make things a bit easier.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0122317_0123043 But the thing is, if we've got that, then it's going to be needing really to load the entire corpus for that meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123043_0123539 If it's trying to show us where those were, if it's trying to hang like those in the text, transcript or whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123539_0123775 Now we're gonna have to have all that other game.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0123775_0124048 So each time we have a search window and we have like, you know,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124048_0124307 Tender for meetings, the word wireless comes up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124307_0124688 Go to meet in one of the next real-life, the normal object.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124688_0124836 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0124836_0125272 I mean that's kind of... Yeah, it's not too slow though, that thing. It's not too bad.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125272_0125338 Okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0125539_0126076 It always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least. Like that song. Yeah. It's just loading it up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126076_0126392 他是专心玩心,手当我了
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126392_0126975 So just sort of based on that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0126975_0127464 But if it doesn't take that long each time then that should be it. Alright.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0128741_0128774 parents.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0129973_0130006 Let's go.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0130824_0131060 Please have a chance.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131060_0131406 And that way I think I was specifically watching me eating some healths over the time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131406_0131880 Because I'm sure they don't want to have the extra loading time. Either they can avoid it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0131880_0132180 So yeah, where they can check mark, thinking it's the ones they want to check.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0132988_0133108 Well, I think they were in the text room.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0133108_0133838 We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of be BDB, you know, just do it. There is a... Yeah, in one of the...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134088_0134278 Sıcağız
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134278_0134441 Да, это очень.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134441_0134649 Like the work that it's part of.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0134767_0134902 I'm probably just gonna use that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135309_0135394 Heh!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0135999_0136107 See if it's accurate.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0138712_0139019 Do you actually need the frequencies?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139480_0139554 Oh, right, that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0139574_0139634 Okay, okay.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140160_0140436 The whole thing is if it's being done... If somebody's done the key, so...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0140755_0141096 There's a class she's trying to get to work on Friday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141096_0141729 They did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0141729_0142205 But it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff, but it, at the last I heard it wasn't working.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142205_0142825 So she's going to look at a more straightforward sort of thing that really just fills what we need it to do.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0142825_0143125 But if we need the... if we do need the frequencies...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143368_0143467 다음 다음
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0143784_0144054 Well, it would have been like a lot of stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0144389_0144452 What's the sample?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147353_0147533 cork or still data.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147533_0147825 Yeah, probably a channel, please.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0147825_0148187 Absolutely. Plus a stop list so you remove stuff that doesn't.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0149632_0149922 What's the eye hint to your idea? In this book.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0150668_0150690 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158468_0158525 Sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158525_0158712 Yeah, that's why I'm thinking to. Do we need to?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0158712_0159014 I mean, we're just like, oh, for your stuff I am.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0159014_0159111 No, that's not what this is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0161982_0162591 Non ti voglio dare il no al documento. No, lo vedo. Sai, va, è da niente.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162649_0162718 感谢
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0162718_0162746 Hmm.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0163504_0163648 やっぱりすきなマリガだ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0164960_0165013 I don't know
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165013_0165350 Actually, because this is your top one and this is your bottom. Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165350_0165897 But the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they're looking for a particular term or something.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0165897_0166317 They just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and I want to see it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0167571_0168186 If it's like a two word term, does it TFIDF?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168186_0168529 It's not a compound now, it's just two words together. Bull-a-wup.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168529_0168814 음.. 이 놈은.. 다르다
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168814_0168924 방투노
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0168924_0169280 This is something like a language and a university.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169446_0169675 笑
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169675_0169803 サニーベージ
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0169803_0169843 Não.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0170922_0171222 It's not making my company.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171385_0171739 Because the thing is, the way we were doing it, we were just looking for the words
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0171739_0172055 period each word in the index.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172055_0172193 Well that's way worth it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172193_0172508 And then it's just saying, were these two words in any of these documents?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0172508_0173238 And if it wasn't, we'd go closer and do the next research. Yeah. Look for the exact term or the regular expression.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0175914_0176170 Are we choosing the list of meetings we wanted to search to do?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176170_0176242 I feel that's...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176617_0176931 I just wonder if it's going to give us something cool, then yeah, absolutely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0176931_0177652 But if it's sort of like, if the next keys are just still gotta be run to find these terms or these groups. Yeah, without
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0177957_0178333 or also like do wild cards work for something like that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178333_0178889 So if you're looking for a wireless wired wire, blah blah blah, you can do wire with this.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0178889_0179192 I actually think that's a problem for me too.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179192_0179324 So, it's a work of art.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179324_0179364 BOOM!
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0179683_0179870 The only idea is that gives you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180329_0180467 Let's try it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180467_0180583 Okay, almost, yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0180583_0180653 The world.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181036_0181057 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181454_0181530 Actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0181880_0182342 Yeah, I've got some somewhere.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182591_0182876 I'm just a figures
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0182876_0183163 Do the PDF, switch it to PostScript, switch it back to PDF.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183580_0183640 Huh.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0183640_0183894 Thanks for your time.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0184522_0184819 Nou, oké.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0186835_0186923 Prove it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0187258_0187797 We're all but for the most part, I mean there'll be a set of people that do announce that they're getting a new comment.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188405_0188759 search for stuff or start working. Yeah, I guess I
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0188759_0189152 Yeah, I guess that's good. Brows. Okay, like search, browse.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189349_0189594 Like if you're looking for something specific, like is that what you're thinking?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0189594_0190013 Like if they know exactly where they want to go, they want to go to that meeting on December 3rd.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0190013_0190401 They just can't go there and see stuff then they can really go and browse.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0191972_0192304 Brows by meeting, browse by vlog, browse by speaker.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192304_0192679 Like, no, I'm just thinking of different ways we can do that, like different buttons on the top.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0192679_0193086 like if they're looking for a particular person, a particular working group, particular whatever.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193086_0193671 And we just, uh, we could break things down like that to that level of detail every month.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0193671_0193905 Were we good? Keep it for channel?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195177_0195627 Yeah, but I'm just thinking like initially when they load up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195627_0195904 What are the range of things that they'd want to do?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0195904_0196265 Like if they're part of X Working Group, the one getting there.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196265_0196481 Do we want to save preferences?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0196786_0197287 Well, if they're part of BDB working group, they're going to want to look at the BDB ones and some default to that.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197287_0197384 Hmm
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0197610_0198058 based on what they did last time. They can have the safe references.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199005_0199280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0199424_0199910 It's probably the best and find your favourite one. Yeah, it's not enough in relation.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200239_0200457 Wat een heleboel.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200457_0200585 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200585_0200849 I forget.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0200922_0201065 Okay
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201065_0201541 Well, no, I'm just getting back to the sort of what could be on the startup screen.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201541_0201912 Like there's just a range of things we could do. We could have search options, browse options.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0201912_0202445 and just, I don't know, just playing around with my ideas.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0202445_0203527 And then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say, well, if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203527_0203630 and then do this blow off.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203630_0203968 So we can sort of guide them.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0203968_0204271 And it's just like, hey, my task is to do this, and there's a button.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204271_0204383 Perfect.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204383_0204496 HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204496_0204529 Huh?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0204529_0204737 I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205682_0205884 No, no to znowu ramy w cudzowie śniec.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0205884_0206558 I was just saying, these are just a lot of programs, all kind of lame programs, that's where they first come in.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0206558_0207407 just because they don't want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly use tasks or just exit and just let me use the program.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207407_0207598 So, good luck.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0207992_0208211 Probably worse search or something. Yeah, what's that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209137_0209471 I just instantly got possessed like a fine specific meeting.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0209471_0209691 Tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak,
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0210971_0211077 such as well down things
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217577_0217753 Well, we don't actually have usernames to use.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0217753_0218050 You know, I thought these codes was...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218519_0218657 In a case like that, we do want drop down.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0218657_0218789 We don't want them to type from doing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219359_0219525 and allow multiple
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0219563_0219865 Okay, you're just looking for one specific.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0221052_0221142 Amazing one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0224492_0224581 Until then.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0227069_0227251 Yeah, that's a thing, that's a thing.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230548_0230731 You go over there. Then that doesn't get any better.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0230731_0230930 Не, мы не должны быть садены.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234609_0234815 I'll check the model while I see.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0234815_0235146 But I think in that case it's the right corpus.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235146_0235208 No.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0235208_0235417 Yeah, it is your right, it's the right covers.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0236358_0236513 Yeah, next one.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0239953_0240051 There it is.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240638_0240914 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0240914_0240980 Definitely.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0241644_0241921 Well, I'm really just gonna keep on going.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0242621_0243025 Might be useful, wouldn't it? Yeah. Like Friday afternoons?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0243877_0244106 and we won't have to have a meeting with Steve on Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244106_0244159 for real.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244241_0244628 So do we want to arrange this, get this one earlier?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0244628_0244888 Three. Hmm?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245098_0245167 Damn that's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0245587_0245678 Okay, yeah, sure.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246596_0246706 Possibly, I don't know.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246706_0246996 Usually by the end of the day.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0246996_0247596 Although, well, I don't know, because it's the live-off and trying to get some work done for the vlogger stuff.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248060_0248216 Okay, right
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248216_0248298 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248688_0248940 3 o'clock?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0248940_0249187 I think so, I heard you wanted to help.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249187_0249353 Ah il m'a regardé comme non, chaud.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249353_0249436 Ah, de classe que é, não?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249767_0249998 Because I think she's got a class at 11.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0249998_0250371 Live on the current one three, what's up? Class 12.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250371_0250565 さようなら
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250776_0250894 I hope you could try it.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0250894_0251001 We could try short and out.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251001_0251148 One year.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251148_0251339 Well, it wouldn't be long enough.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251339_0251379 for you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251379_0251707 Would you want that? No, I'll call you.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0251707_0251921 If one's bad for you then we won't come.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252235_0252278 you
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0252855_0252933 the blogging sites.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259469_0259873 There's just sort of the basic implementations that I was wondering about.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0259873_0260094 Partant, au téléphone.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260094_0260376 Ну, профессион.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260376_0260692 Did we decide whether to do ranked?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0260798_0260979 Oh well, basically
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0261426_0262136 Nice at the end. Kind of thinking we'd complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262136_0262837 just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document it's not really getting them together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0262837_0263091 like if someone's working for a particular town.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263091_0263526 I don't know, just don't know if it brings us that much.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0263668_0263708 Calça.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264093_0264561 If they're looking for, like I say, Sunday and...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264561_0264931 Yeah, Sunny shows up in this document, Day shows up with the nut together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0264931_0265179 um more if they're
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0265179_0265811 It just doesn't... You're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up, it shows up.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0268462_0268812 That's for single tabs, it would be very useful.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0269500_0269766 It's just gonna be simple.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270757_0270985 you can just spot a way to do the search
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0270985_0271210 Just still do the next T-shirt trend, huh?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271210_0271367 y ahí te dian exceso
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271367_0271506 together either just
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271599_0271853 waiting against it. So how many pairs you can get?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0271853_0272207 wouldn't show up on the search results if it didn't exist.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0272813_0273225 We'll have to talk to Pernella about this. Yeah, because they're on COG.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0273225_0273883 if we are using that I mean it does make sense for that but actually
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274305_0274557 something you're going to get a lot of results
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0274879_0275247 I think it's also... I mean, if it's...
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275247_0275434 Yeah, okay, search me.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275434_0275852 I think we could actually put that on the list of meetings that get returned.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0275852_0276514 If there are 15 meetings with languages in, then it's going to show you those and rank them as two which is the highest.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0276514_0276625 So you're okay, you see that?
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278040_0278313 The things, I mean, that'll be exactly how we're doing it now.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278313_0278617 Like we're just looking for the two words separately and see if the existence in document
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278617_0278907 if they do, then there's possibility that they occur together.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0278907_0279111 And then we do the inaccessibility on that document.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0279318_0279373 I'm at Soviet Union.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280821_0280998 Um, but right now it's not doing anything.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0280998_0281269 I don't know what to say.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281269_0281344 Praczę.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281344_0281597 Mais c'est pas le cas, mais c'est le 17e.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0281597_0281750 Wow.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0282891_0282954 That's true.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0283224_0283732 Δεν θα πειτε τα μάα.
AMI_EN2002c_SDM_MEE073_0287628_0287707 Yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0002063_0002511 It's okay every time. You're doing so good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0004128_0004707 Oh, this looks good. It's spicy. Oh, it's really...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0006734_0007677 Can I have one? Drop them? Yeah, I'm not gonna say that. Too slippery.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0007677_0008425 It may be very fascinating feeling this band.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0008425_0008509 Padej o nie.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0011420_0012024 Was that as a... No, that was just summer. No. No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012024_0012207 But, what?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0012207_0012328 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019391_0019703 I think I like this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0019703_0020121 You've got fished here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0021504_0021700 Aber ich finde...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0024953_0025451 They live there but there's
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0026983_0027218 Should we run the other way? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0028081_0028133 I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0033434_0033643 Va a tener males.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0035739_0035785 unique
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0039504_0039938 But that took me so long.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0042040_0042072 Have a nice day.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0052524_0052865 And her.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0068919_0069261 I'm just so interested in this guy because he sees me funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0069261_0070287 Yeah, I'm gonna say it. It's taking the next joke. Have a good one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0084666_0084871 Yeah, in the top left.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087192_0087460 We have a big yellow one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0087460_0088218 What if I skimmed that before? It would be super exciting. Super exciting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0088236_0089082 Yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0089082_0089224 어? 어?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0095446_0096325 We have to remember to include that in our evaluation. How did the... improved your browsing experience.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0099902_0100259 I guess that's why we have separate speech lines.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0100305_0100661 Блэба
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0101446_0102253 I'm running some troubles with the indexing but I found another package instead of writing it from the scratch.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0102253_0102750 because it's a little bit, I don't know, just know that I haven't put it on it much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0103034_0103425 We'll see what happens in the next few days.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0104085_0104232 What is many?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0105967_0106108 I just want you to know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108083_0108360 We can expect this cross to be somewhat tough.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0108360_0109058 Yeah, that's right. Feels like it's a job. It's a job of course. I'm in the L.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0109058_0109200 Practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0114513_0115039 I thought we said... Yeah, I thought we changed it to the 10th or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0115201_0115311 So...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120108_0120189 It's so much
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120308_0120594 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0120594_0120764 That would give us the idea.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0122211_0122354 Change. Yeah, I think so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0122354_0122457 I mean we could
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0122613_0122772 Showing my rap Monday
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0123208_0123252 to Steve.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0127211_0128210 The thing is, you know, because we're going to get an email on our MSC. We're looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0129220_0129630 Well, they're gonna you know, they're gonna scratch
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0129630_0130067 So they should set up the perception projects and things like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0130067_0130510 It's not going to take long, it's only going to be hot now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0130510_0130868 We need to use each other.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0131225_0131608 Have more of a break. So then, if you need to get him...

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0149671_0149979 after this Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0149979_0150056 Nicht geht's auf mich.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0150568_0150621 Nah

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0152281_0152785 You have a timeline, we're a bit into 25th and that's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0152986_0153581 That's why I'm trying to find this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154016_0154252 I have to have a party on the 24th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0154557_0154768 Kind of lectures.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0155606_0155728 Oh, it's actually 24.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160131_0160714 Did he say anything about what he expects of the final report and stuff?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0160714_0160855 Like, no. I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162302_0162513 All the way to the next one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0162725_0162808 Oui.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0163258_0164252 Because this is, I mean, we have interim reports of seven pages and that's we can say, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164252_0164518 We could probably just expand that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0164660_0164909 I mean, a lot of it is going to be the same thing.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0165915_0166112 I don't think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166261_0166473 It is going to be.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0166682_0166722 네

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0198555_0199395 It should be very simple to just get the topics and summaries from using that text extractor. Any wrong cry?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0199631_0199794 Again, it's just good topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO070_0200307_0200435 Thank you.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0002312_0002562 Oh dear, it's a filter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0002952_0003133 But dream, dream right?

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013694_0013806 いや、そうだ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0013999_0014535 No, when you said it at the beginning I thought, must check the rewrite in the next one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0017326_0017558 Je suis là.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0018698_0018894 I'm here to get my work done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0019388_0019671 Seems I like this.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020309_0020675 There is a file in the directory called disful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0020863_0020953 I... was...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022810_0022869 Bye guys.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0022869_0023008 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023380_0023460 Have a good day.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0023621_0024047 Yeah, that was... That was just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025012_0025312 Was ist das?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0025312_0025661 I don't know where he lived there, but there's all that even more stuff there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0026400_0026858 What? Actually, I don't know how to explain that. Okay. So we probably won up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0027366_0027487 Реально.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028244_0028456 Has anyone had time to play with it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0028841_0028914 Werde ich am Ende?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0030210_0030251 What?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031013_0031119 Mais und so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031119_0031314 It was really dirty.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031314_0031602 The thing is that yeah, there is, as I said, a while ago
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0031602_0032314 there is still this one error which is bugging in NXT and that always generates these
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032314_0032693 I think when you left click or right click or something, I can't remember now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0032835_0033593 But if it's a real error then it stops so it can't be fixed. Yeah, I didn't scam any of those yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035556_0035682 Yeah, we good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0035682_0036229 Is there any comments you have about just like wording or some sort of minor things?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0036931_0037073 I'm on this job as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037073_0037439 At the moment as well the whole winners at Pulp Up are not pretty tall.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0037439_0038026 but I would make them a bit nicer to have more time at the moment and just look like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0038026_0038251 No, it's not, it's not, it's not here. I'm at the top.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0039715_0040133 But that took me so long to do this blow start.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040229_0040610 So I'm quite glad that it looks, you know, nice on one road or this kind of thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0040826_0040967 No, this is just, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043111_0043280 Oh god.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0043872_0044186 wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0044186_0045922 I've done some like a couple of things to me. Really sweet of you. Try that a few times. Yeah, I started using your... I don't know if you've seen that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046694_0046770 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046770_0046985 But it's good, your sound is really good. Good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0046985_0047241 He's got a good interface then. Easy to use.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0047241_0047277 Nice.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050087_0050345 So I'll go to that and then
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0050983_0051183 So eine Säge, aha, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051521_0051791 No, that's very interesting. Kind of boring. Exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0051791_0051870 It's very
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0052391_0052733 They're asleep, I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0053528_0054020 So which, you know, suggests, maybe you can suggest a few that which would be interesting to list.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054020_0054141 Like, signals.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0054999_0055042 3
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059149_0059684 I mean do we care if you know I don't know what doesn't really matter I think you know it'd be difficult
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0059782_0060580 But it would be difficult if in the speaker characterization window we had a heading in a top five dialogue act.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0060580_0061211 And then the little brackets, but they're not actually the top five, but top five minus the most common ones which are, you know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0062130_0062233 For the speaker.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063316_0063513 No, I wouldn't. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0063921_0064001 So, thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064597_0064749 We'll top five this meeting and then the rest is...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0064997_0065404 Yeah, just do top five, both local and global, and then have another.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0065511_0066137 But then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0067354_0067828 E fala a mim o sábado.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068535_0068751 Yeah, so that's what speaking capitalization is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0068933_0068999 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0070291_0071373 So is this percentage then? If you say like joke for the speaker is percentage.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0071373_0072234 I don't know, 20. What percentage of his speech is a joke? What percentage of the dialogue is?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0072390_0072533 謝謝
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0076024_0076748 I will expect that too. Yeah, I mean, just keep it simple.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079148_0079241 You will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0079655_0079701 So
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0080298_0080635 Yeah, I was thinking that. It sort of turned out that way, didn't it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081393_0081435 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081435_0081503 I'm still here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0081701_0081788 Oh!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0083604_0084156 I have one little question that I reckon we should have a little icon from.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084458_0084804 Wel, nid.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0084804_0085504 The other man they've got on X which is, you know, NXT and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that. Yeah, it was something else.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0085748_0086228 No, that's something original.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086228_0086606 I would have said Jack.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0086606_0086931 Is there anything else I think I was in M? Yeah, I know, yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0087488_0088107 What have I skimmed that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089655_0089703 沒錯
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0089864_0090401 I mean it's tiny so we can't really put more than one character, really. One sort of simple...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0090996_0091065 Bir daha yedik.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092316_0092511 Well if you find anything then send it to me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0092623_0092786 Otherwise I'll make up some ends.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093222_0093399 I know, I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0093399_0093461 Bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094007_0094383 Yeah, I know how to put it there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094383_0094598 But I'll have to import it somehow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094598_0094669 Não é uma coachão
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0094912_0095078 Yeah, I know. I'm so into it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0096698_0096891 기립을
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0097278_0097652 Welcome to another meeting. Can we get sound on these machines? No, let's go.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0098936_0099810 If the sound card is registered to your name, which it usually is not, and you have to reboot, sometimes it does all that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0109184_0109734 It's an NXT package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110371_0110848 I mean sometimes I have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0110848_0111427 I think it was... Right, I'll try this then and see what it's made.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0114594_0114697 아이고, 막 하고 있었지!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116565_0116699 I continue.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0116932_0117417 Well that's the problem because Steve hasn't given us any details.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118045_0118119 Best of luck.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118486_0118681 I love you too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0118798_0118957 It's just brainstorming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119308_0119597 The thing is, yeah, we had the deadline last Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0119597_0120310 but we won't be able to do any evaluation during the weekend anyway. So I think we could set Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0120589_0120727 And that would give us the idea.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124504_0124539 진짜
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0124539_0124631 I think that's why
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125696_0125814 Push it up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0125814_0126195 But at the end we'll say, you never go to any Tesla, don't you?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126439_0126709 Well, sort of, that's how I end this. He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126709_0126933 He would make something up. But okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0126933_0127272 Yeah, find some people who did it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0127272_0127400 생일 지금 계속
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0128207_0129005 I think if we don't get anything from him then we should just do our friends by a third lane.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0129539_0129786 Well, they were screaming so they should have...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130084_0130181 It's not good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0130181_0130389 and you're gonna be hot now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0131849_0132005 like highly-
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132005_0132102 Nothing will be.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0132203_0132302 We'll have to be in.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0133368_0133554 I was thinking of like 10.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135493_0135700 I think a range of people, they have three.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0135848_0136057 That's it. What else do you...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137042_0137183 There should just have two.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0137207_0137686 Мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам, мадам,
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0138306_0139183 and other things. We have the presentation on like in one and a half weeks or something whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139183_0139283 Nearly two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139470_0139766 Oh, it's true. Yeah, it's two weeks then.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0139766_0140033 Do we have to have done the evaluation by then?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141001_0141075 Tu jakaś ta...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141075_0141211 24th
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141211_0141299 Yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0141791_0141925 Not Good Friday!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0142694_0142974 I'm sure on the website it says Thursday. Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0143656_0144109 Well, you know, the question is, do we need the evaluation for the presentation?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144673_0144807 We should definitely ask him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0144807_0144937 Because if not then...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0146055_0146174 Yeah, you're gonna be right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0147522_0147750 Because we need the right presentation as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148526_0148668 Exactly, Leigh.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0148668_0148771 It's like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0149119_0149585 Well, I'm not free after this Monday, but I'm free after the end of the week.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0150257_0150782 I mean I don't have anything after the act 2
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0151069_0151276 But that's inomiting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0152163_0152341 So, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0155338_0155536 I just prefer to eat right in my email.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0156342_0156473 Da, nie.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157162_0157354 But it's still important to me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157354_0157436 another part of the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157584_0157793 對嘛,對呀
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0157793_0158247 I mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation of the first place.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158247_0158353 And...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158660_0158735 What was the other one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0158872_0159599 Basically, how is it going with your evaluation?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0159599_0160018 We got people we had for us. What you thinking? When?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0161530_0161870 Do we know? Did you ever say how long it was supposed to be?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162181_0162365 Yes. Do you want to have a?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162784_0162869 But who can I love?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0162869_0163120 I mean, I can't really see everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0164008_0164164 Zajmij.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0165590_0165676 Yeah, well, let's go.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0166237_0166299 Actually
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167052_0167284 So, do you want to write me an email then? Sure.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167284_0167326 Let me get you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0167850_0168296 And when I go home today, which would be before...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0168622_0169192 Before I pass six I will make that file readable.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169318_0169404 Mm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169404_0169517 Well I will...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0169906_0170600 Well I will need your snippets of code or if it would be good if I had them by tomorrow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0170935_0171105 I was gonna ask...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171289_0171434 At the moment, you're search window.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0171565_0171657 How's it organized?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172507_0172809 But at the beginning, when you haven't searched yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0172809_0173357 Yn ymwneud yma, yna'r banynod yma i ddweud, ac y ddweud yma'r bwysig yn ymwneud? Yn ymwneud.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0173882_0174181 And then if you, I don't know, double click on one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0175887_0175963 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0176802_0177381 我不是愛過嗎?你也錯了
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0177559_0178451 Maybe you want to do one left click highlights the result in whatever you've got open.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178805_0178847 together.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0178969_0179185 various like, different topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0179185_0179812 Usually one life like it's highlights it, cross highlights everything. I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181008_0181185 Well, it's difficult because...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0181679_0181767 Wait for it, Chris.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182347_0182533 It's typical.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182533_0182797 because the transcription window does cross highlighting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0182924_0183290 in a very awkward way because he has to find the topic first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183290_0183584 That was okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0183744_0184682 and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0184682_0185363 And that works when you left double click on a topic, on a meeting, sorry, then it loads it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185470_0185530 So you can
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185645_0185769 You could take that for loading.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0185971_0186525 So if we have that the same on this one, at least that you if you double left click then it loads.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187847_0187994 Highlights, yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0187994_0188550 I mean obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here. Oh just that um. But also highlights um
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0188848_0188969 Actually it's difficult because...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0189484_0190231 Because you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be over. Well I suppose if you have a local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190231_0190333 then it could cross our nose.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0190932_0191506 Because you know, if you get back several different meetings here and you've only got one meeting open then you can't cross out anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0193267_0193395 Well just
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0194506_0194561 I don't know if I'm...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0195663_0195780 Pela válvula, se o emene.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0196279_0197295 Well, in any case, if you left click on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open, then it should cross highlight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0197295_0197410 If not, it can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200617_0200677 きにまいが
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0200781_0201493 Is it very difficult to make another gooey but only for a global search?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0201930_0202490 just take that away the local cake box.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202490_0202650 Because they're not friendly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0202772_0202979 Yeah, because in the start of the screen you can't have it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203231_0203342 Yeah, we'll do it right back.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203342_0203575 Love you. That's great.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203575_0203798 Everything else can just stay the same, you know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0203798_0204134 and five you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbox.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0204584_0204934 Ready about?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_FEO072_0216087_0216123 Are we done?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007053_0007312 See you guys!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0007312_0007390 I'm finished!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0011917_0012147 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0017470_0017772 Yeah, it's just... I think that's a little chaos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0019495_0019601 Seems a lot of things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0020970_0021307 I think I saw that and
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0022410_0023001 It doesn't have anything in it, it has about three lines of XML.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023214_0023273 What's that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0023775_0024183 They just seem to be occupied.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024183_0024302 Special right as well
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024302_0024419 됐어 됐어
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0024562_0025175 I had lots of stuff in there yesterday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025175_0025310 I know it's just dumb.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025310_0025643 I don't know if they lived there, but they all had even more stuff there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025643_0025952 I was unzipping all these crazy huge things that were in your...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0025952_0026083 I needed them, they were for this night.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0026083_0026667 It's alright, brother. I was recording on that one. What? Actually, you know how to do it now? Excuse me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027076_0027357 Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like eight gigs on it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027357_0027476 ¡Soy el CEN!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0027476_0027982 Das ist ein must-begetan-hole-Bauerheim, aber ich weiß es nicht.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028614_0028945 Schreibt es euch in die Kommentare.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0028945_0029123 Now he's getting really
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029123_0029191 예, 알았지
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0029599_0030007 They generate a lot of exceptions in the background.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0030007_0030205 But they didn't cause any problems, but it just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033280_0033537 Yeah, I didn't discover any of those yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033537_0033821 No tiene malesca.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0033821_0034404 I fronted it to see if it didn't write too. I didn't like that long then. It seemed alright really.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034404_0034674 And the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0034674_0034783 스페인
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036267_0036363 No, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036363_0036835 The only thing is the start-up is not too pretty.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0036835_0037111 But this is my father's job as a scholar.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038021_0038352 No, it's not, it's not, it's not the top priority.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038566_0038773 I think it'll look better on Windows as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0038773_0039024 Cysyllt y jaw i'r ysgol yw'r ysgol yn ymdweud, yn ffordd.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0039343_0039428 Actually, can we?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0040098_0040140 Today!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0041480_0041897 Well, they have... They have... Speak characterizations, please.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042029_0042437 I haven't updated all those objects fast yet though because it takes ages on the computers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042437_0042884 It's faster for some bizarre reason if I log in at home and then run the code.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0042884_0043116 It runs it much faster than it would here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043276_0043666 Wait, that's... I just can't look to sit in 11-way health and have a word with you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0043889_0044535 I've done some play-doh before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0044535_0044929 You're really speeded up!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045839_0045916 That's the line.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0045916_0046646 So that it tells you what speakers are in which meeting and then you can see which topics. Which topics? Yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0046646_0046715 そういう
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047380_0047894 The dialogue acts are all done and they're quite amusing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0047894_0048815 But some of the things that I wanted to talk about with our little guys was there are some that occur all the time and I don't know how interesting there are.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0048815_0049448 So the first one statement is that it will, I removed it because it was like everything is prefixed by statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0049448_0050088 every single dialogue act starts with a statement. So everybody stops the dialogue act statement.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050088_0050129 So that's it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050245_0050314 So I'll go into that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050314_0050682 and then everybody, the next one seems to mostly be back jump.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050682_0050792 I don't know what that means.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0050792_0050952 See you guys over there, back to channel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051210_0051277 Is that what that means?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051277_0051370 I will keep it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051370_0051605 And then the other side.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051884_0051947 3人ぼだんだ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0051947_0052095 There are some people who don't do that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052095_0052411 So yeah, you can see that they don't do anything. And it's the bottom of their list.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052523_0052876 And I...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0052876_0053288 Some people have an acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time. Yes, no questions.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0053288_0053572 So which one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054120_0054797 That's the thing I thought I wanted to know whether or not we could, because at the moment you can get, there's a method that will just give you the top five or the top X.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0054797_0055107 So you give it any number, it will give you the total number for each person.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0055107_0056001 And then each meeting knows about all the different dialogs for each person in the meeting and then mount that that occurred.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056001_0056677 and we'll give you that in top order as well or you can just search for each specific dialogette.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0056677_0057267 .. but you have to search on in decent cases rather than real words
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057267_0057447 I can sense that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057447_0057616 So I don't know what we want to display.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0057616_0057967 That's what I'm asking you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0058705_0058934 All the love, all's like 25.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0059098_0059276 I think the way to make him
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061270_0061732 I think we should have the global top 5 because each speaker has a top whatever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0061732_0062279 So just say one of the boxes just explains that this is my top 5 dark obex for the speaker
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0062279_0062926 And then in the meeting you have what you can either have the most commonly occurring ones or you can have a list of each speaker's top 30x.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063063_0063146 either of those would they use
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063146_0063342 But they would start thinking about the space in the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063541_0063654 お行きだすないだ、ねぇだ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063654_0063991 Because it's a speaker window, the speaker character when it comes up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0063991_0064404 So you've got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0064404_0064962 And then the top five in that in global top five this meeting and then the rest is yeah obvious
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066048_0066086 對

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0066714_0067023 Well they do sometimes but they're not that common.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067023_0067170 One guy has top 5 ch-
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067170_0067229 one of his talk
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067229_0067328 Die sind an den Kopf.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067328_0067396 That's funny.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0067426_0068442 You fall out of this one. This is good for browsing though. It's perfect for that story. In fact, it was fun to do it with the beat.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0068558_0068633 See you next time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069233_0069679 It's taking me to the next joke.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0069860_0070409 That would be quite good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0072044_0072846 Yn ymwneud y dylaiwyr yng Nghymru, mae'n gweithio'r dylaiwyr yn y gweithio yn y gweithio yn y gweithio'r dylaiwyr, mae'n gweithio'r dylaiwyr.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073056_0073347 I think most things are coded with a dialog X.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073347_0073526 The law of the McCulloch was zero, which means no labels.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073526_0073733 Você vai ser engordado?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073733_0073790 Accessory.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0073946_0074059 and statement which is boring.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074059_0074781 And also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something, so if I quote a joke to you, they separate that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0074781_0075165 So they put the dialogue acts and they put the dialogue on the outside.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075165_0075639 just ignore any quite immaterial because it's been out of the way with... Yeah, it's not a real job anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075639_0075772 Ya, seseorang yang lain saja.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0075772_0076025 So you have to be original about your material.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0076025_0076404 Oh, that's that crap.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077423_0077500 Ja, das wird dann...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077500_0077559 Wow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0077673_0078155 Ja, das finde ich immer ein bisschen bräuchig.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078155_0078195 and some of it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078195_0078339 But I think it's pretty much complete now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078339_0078429 So I'll do that tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078429_0078493 just putting out there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0078493_0078683 I think it's not easy now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0080941_0081261 No, I just got meeting and speaker.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081261_0081362 我還可以下去嗎
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0081863_0082071 You can put it in a package.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082181_0082258 Thank you very much.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082410_0082679 Well, it doesn't seem to make any difference. I've never used driving packages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082679_0082941 It doesn't even make any difference.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0082941_0083101 is that it's in the same directory it works.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0083101_0083343 Sorry!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0084289_0084638 You can double click on it. Well, no.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085342_0085510 Yeah, it was just a big one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0085510_0085735 Just borrow a little Microsoft GIF like that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087174_0087240 We have it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0087458_0087887 What have I seen that before?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0089751_0089873 엠핑이 아침부터
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0090954_0091434 Eu tive que me dar um canito para a macia, se eu não for macia, isso é muito difícil.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0091434_0092082 I don't know what's that.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093351_0093450 It's really easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0093450_0094076 You do it in one of the, whatever the main window is, you do set gear force and set picture or something.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094076_0094130 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0094723_0094995 I think you just keep it a far away and it knows.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095198_0095345 Yeah, yeah, just, just, in Christmastime.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0095345_0095469 네, 네.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0096862_0097042 He can even have some sound that comes on him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097042_0097588 So the meeting gets out on these machines
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097588_0097750 No, that's perfect.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0097750_0097841 はっせーでー
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0098317_0098701 No, but I think if you put headphones in it'll just play, just normal.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0099842_0099951 from time to time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0106575_0107074 I still can't make it from TNT from Jolte. Seriously? Maybe I'll try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107074_0107140 Eu ia eita
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0107140_0107443 Heb je hem wel zacht?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0108805_0109267 It's a job. It's a job. Practical job.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0109598_0109694 Cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0110835_0110927 Yeah, I think it was like
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111060_0111155 Свои дать!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0111299_0112231 It was plainly generated by going to generate a Java doc and just went, it's not doing well and they never thought it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112554_0112756 It's good to know what methods are there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112756_0112904 without having to look at the source code.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0112904_0112944 Yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0113268_0113370 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114442_0114592 次回は今度ね
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0114592_0114681 아 이 바깥고 있어
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124630_0124769 We didn't have the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0124769_0124899 Nu e bine si ce stii d-ai tu?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125011_0125070 Sainte-Malime
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0125070_0125180 I hope you will do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126155_0126235 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0126563_0126708 He said he would try.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0132751_0132990 Haben wir ein Gehirn, die wir hier entscheiden.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133265_0133358 Ready?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133528_0133914 No, it was fake forever and then it got analysed as a result.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0133914_0134088 Like the Queen...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0135705_0136941 Yeah, one computer says this. One dude of the smoothies. One dude of the smoothies. One of the smoothies. One of the smoothies. One of the smoothies.

AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0137100_0137490 I'm just up two. My bad.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139417_0139544 To which. Always true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0139544_0139677 Yeah, it is two weeks now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140616_0140712 Ben sana nefret ediyorum.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0140712_0140962 25th. 25th. Oh right, it says that's the 30th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141119_0141248 24th
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0141940_0142114 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145149_0145491 We should have it, we should try and have it done by then anyway, I think.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0145491_0145868 otherwise it was thought of them getting... yeah that's probably tight otherwise
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146247_0146629 We should aim to be finished by Monday, this Monday coming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146629_0146885 Well, basically for Tuesday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0146885_0147214 Stop the evaluation pretty much straight away and then get
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147364_0147545 Yeah, and then get um
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147696_0147872 We're still writing the report and everything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0147872_0147950 Cheers, bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150022_0150518 That's easy compared to what you did.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0150813_0151225 and you must have your research prepared. That's in all meaning.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151225_0151432 Is that in on me actually?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0151652_0152009 아, 지효 씨.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199496_0199655 Yeah, US Star again.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0199655_0200097 Just good topics. So you have to get the topics out instead of the segments.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0200097_0200142 Here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0204919_0205171 You're going to be able to do a global search for topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205569_0205767 Is that my video? Yeah, but make a...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0205965_0206035 매일
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206073_0206264 E eu já tenho que ir para o Vida do Leão aqui.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206264_0206444 ¿Pue? Te tengo que levantar, verdad.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206444_0206625 Well, it's kind of insane.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0206625_0206726 Yer et hacı olun
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0207919_0208441 Well, what's that? Do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it. But we're not gonna do it. At the very least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209642_0209821 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209821_0209934 Dargâh videoda.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0209934_0210340 Well, even if I haven't managed to make it, do some keywords.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210340_0210705 I don't think we can expect you to also come up with a search link as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210877_0210998 You're quitting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0210998_0211183 Wenn man das nicht macht, dann ist es ja.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211183_0211507 Yeah, I'm great at it, I'm fast, but I don't know what to do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211507_0211992 I did have a look at trying to create XML files.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0211992_0212200 انت لداخل رائعاً امشن لي
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212200_0212531 It's a straightforward writing in it so my old class
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212531_0212781 but it's organising the segment there to the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0212781_0213044 It just looks so complicated to get it from.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0213203_0214288 Yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ymwneud y ffordd, yn ym
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214288_0214589 Ich habe nur das, was ich mache.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214589_0214771 うん
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0214959_0215201 자, 그럼 이제..
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218105_0218169 Yeah, we did.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE071_0218169_0218366 We need another meeting this week.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0004201_0004336 Oh, it slicks me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0007493_0007587 Tick-Slipper
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0009133_0009200 끝
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011344_0011435 But
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011435_0011518 I'm gonna use that answer.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011518_0011696 No, that's just summary.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0011754_0011982 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012309_0012442 I'll write this one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012641_0012696 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0012988_0013625 I didn't. I was trying to, I did no privileges to get in to update Zero5.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0013625_0014060 I actually meant to send the email and then just continue.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014324_0014843 Yeah, I forget mine as well and it's just like every time I put something in there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0014843_0015002 See ya.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015002_0015254 That was the main thing so, as soon as I turn it will be ready.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015254_0015416 I was making a couple of little changes as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015416_0015672 So those will be able to play one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0015672_0016188 Still working on the, um, trying to get the topics in summary, search implemented as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016188_0016478 So that's where tonight...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016478_0016680 um yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016680_0016966 But no, it's okay. Come on.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0016966_0017340 I'm getting a better feel for all these night objects.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017545_0017761 It's just, it seems a little chaos.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0017761_0018272 Yeah, I know it's like if you're gonna use this stuff later on in your life
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018272_0018612 you spend the time to invest and learn all about them. But it's like wow.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018612_0018924 What's the minimum I can give you? I mean, yeah, I can give you what we need.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0018924_0019419 So it's like, I don't know, unless I want to do something with this in future.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019590_0019753 Happy Easter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0019753_0020065 Dear...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020065_0020117 응
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020117_0020297 que me son
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0020934_0020962 I
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021106_0021208 I think I got it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021208_0021506 I saw that and I'm just trying to remember if I did create it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0021506_0022321 I think I was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago. So that may be mine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022549_0022601 Oh really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022863_0022940 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0022940_0023032 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023032_0023273 Yeah, cause I saw it again today, I was just like...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023273_0023456 Yeah, I think you're asking me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0023456_0023857 Um, the gel, yeah, that was... That just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024270_0024714 I don't know if that's my idea. Giving false impressions of what's happened. It's not explained.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0024880_0025008 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025008_0025238 Yeah!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0025238_0025333 Please watch it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026232_0026377 That's where a quote on that was.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026377_0026667 What is it actually doing on the tree now?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026667_0026774 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0026774_0026982 So we probably won't have to worry about it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0027676_0027902 죄송합니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028023_0028142 Hello.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0028142_0028236 How's everything else going?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0029902_0029991 So, good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030189_0030281 Do you want to keep that?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030281_0030441 Like are we keeping that how that happens?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0030441_0031056 It just prints everything out in the in the shell as well because it does everything and just kind of I guess that's its default behavior.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031056_0031237 So it's just kind of doesn't really do anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0031237_0031329 好
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0032007_0032077 And that's
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0034811_0035151 I was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what I was doing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035151_0035394 So it didn't take it for a full test try again.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035394_0035525 Böpp zahn, ihr könnt ihr da
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0035525_0035715 Yeah, we good
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0036863_0037115 This is probably the strongest one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038183_0038603 I think it's
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038603_0038718 They look better on winnows as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038718_0038753 raus.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0038753_0038799 나
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0039372_0039778 Actually, can we run a company in this?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040120_0040237 We lost it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040589_0040879 Were you using like a GUI builder or just all from code?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0040968_0041094 Okay, and...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041310_0041492 Ciasnaście.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0041892_0041987 Oui.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043448_0043867 I'm well aware of that. Can you connect your home machine from here and then start from there?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043867_0043909 ヘヘ
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0043909_0044253 I'm trying to...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0044253_0044625 I've done some playtime before. Stay damp. To see you. Yeah, really, speed up.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0050822_0050856 Is that what was it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0051559_0051733 That's very, it's kind of boring, man.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0054913_0054979 forever.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057759_0057819 I'm asking.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0057819_0058348 You ready for it? I don't know if we have a choice so they can filter those out. The top most common.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0058348_0058783 Just say, okay, show all or show only the love.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059359_0059504 I don't know. It doesn't really matter.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0059504_0059733 I'm just unmoving filter these out.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0061216_0061303 I'm going. I think
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067906_0067986 喜恨
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0067986_0068106 This is good for browsing though.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068106_0068152 Bye!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068152_0068407 I mean that's sorry. It was fun.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068407_0068548 Yeah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0068837_0068890 Duh
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0069493_0069749 sticking to the next joke
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075358_0075462 Let's do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0075513_0075642 What's matter, Elchok anyways?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077116_0077494 Okay, that's not true. So that's sort of implemented now or is that the right one?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0077764_0077829 いや、それは…
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0078649_0079199 I'm going to have to, you know, just recompile the browsers and then just get that. You will.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079280_0079699 Also it uses my part as well. My damn search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0079699_0080103 Actually, do we have naming convention for our source files?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080103_0080384 Just pick a couple of them and then... Yeah, I was saying...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080690_0080798 Yeah, that's what we're gonna do.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0080798_0081025 Like for your stuff do you have?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081163_0081249 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081369_0081562 That doesn't matter at this point.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081562_0081701 No, I just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0081701_0081885 Oh, think about Future Stop maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082092_0082165 Yeah, that's true too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082282_0082406 Ja, das ist mein Leben.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0082770_0082939 Yeah, good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0084966_0085049 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0085720_0085881 No.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086848_0086949 Yeah, I know, yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0086949_0086988 うん
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0087619_0087884 I've been asking that before.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088088_0088254 Super-sized kneading browser.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088254_0088280 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0088280_0088700 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089258_0089791 Just probably basic text font and something nice, something solid maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0089791_0089834 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090132_0090202 Me and Zach.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090375_0090402 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0090402_0090808 Anybody have any artistic talent?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091249_0091487 Páscoa, só...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091487_0091840 Das ist ein Barsch.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0091917_0092258 We'll check see if I can find him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0092806_0093153 How do you add that to the Java program?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093153_0093342 This is just basic.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0093342_0093493 It's really easy, you do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094287_0094388 I'll just put it down.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094440_0094501 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0094688_0094729 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095016_0095251 Oh so it'll do the automatic scrunching down if it's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0095251_0095320 って
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0096153_0096712 Yes, it is. They know it's a distinctive experience again.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097105_0097311 What?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097451_0097610 Get sound on these machines.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0097654_0098357 Have you ever managed, oh yeah, you must have. Plain and sword music on the dice machines?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098357_0098436 I'm thinking.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098676_0098758 Not really great.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0098758_0098971 If. Definitely on the front too. If.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0099427_0099484 Oui.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100612_0100744 O que não era varia?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0100972_0101247 Okay, well this looks good.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103314_0103778 Are we gonna be trying to get the output from that? I don't know, still haven't found out if it's so.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0103900_0104113 feasible to open up more than one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104113_0104744 As many non-objects as we can for each meeting to do, like we were going to figure that the ranking did make sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0104744_0105104 like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105104_0105252 So we are going to look through only five notes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0105252_0105882 just pick the top five to do the searching. Since that's probably what we're looking for anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106821_0106975 Are you serious?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0106975_0107255 Maybe I'll try. Yeah, you try. Everything might get wet now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0107377_0107864 Well, it's up. Yeah, it'll be a surprise because I'm not a channel.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0108383_0108461 Не, я не хочу.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109005_0109126 Eu não sei, é a voz do cês
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109126_0109300 Practical job. That's it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0109808_0110031 How do you guys find the documentation for an X-Men?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110161_0110304 Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0110304_0110440 This one. I mean sometimes I...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112103_0112218 네, 감사합니다.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112218_0112577 Well, let's still. I think that's research platform. Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0112911_0113066 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113122_0113211 I just curious.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0113883_0114458 Did we have a date for when we actually want the system done?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0114458_0115163 何言わない?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115163_0115809 Because the things I mean we can keep working on little things, you know, I wish it was sweet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0115809_0115932 지금
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0116104_0116933 So I don't do we want to set an actual hard deadline or like when exactly where we're going to start the valuation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117358_0117427 Okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117427_0117920 Well, yeah, I guess we can still come up with test cases or whatever for the people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0117920_0118139 to come up with scenarios. That sort of thing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118139_0118504 I mean that's fairly straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118504_0118703 Thanks for watching.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118703_0118805 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0118805_0119034 Just brainstorming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120063_0120141 Yeah, that's true.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0120773_0120899 to recognize this one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121052_0121445 I've got my DNLG presentation on hand.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0121445_0121759 Do you need a paper? They match now!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0122268_0122340 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123133_0123383 Well, probably if they talked to Steve at some point of time, I guess.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123383_0123515 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123676_0123949 I'll probably just have a regular Tuesday meeting with him.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0123949_0124267 Like we could send him an email but I don't know if he's around either.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124267_0124755 She's out of line this week, isn't she? I think that's why we didn't have the meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0124939_0125003 Hmm.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125180_0125261 Yes, sir.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125261_0125430 Although, do we really want the answer?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0125430_0125786 So if we don't ask, we can push it out of there.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127258_0127312 Yeah, that's...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127630_0127793 Right there!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0127793_0127917 We're looking for volunteers.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129036_0129224 Yeah, if you have time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129224_0129346 ... corresponding people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0129674_0129833 Yeah, I know.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130060_0130210 Yeah, that's what we're saying.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130210_0130370 Yeah, that's true. And you're gonna be hot now.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0130898_0131310 Actually some other friends of mine in different programs might be more willing.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131310_0131482 Have more of a break.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131482_0131772 So then I get a range of types of people as well.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0131772_0132330 Like not highly computer-like not, you know, Lennox literate too.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132330_0132565 Ich glaube, das wäre gut.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132565_0132750 So the wider range of people?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0132950_0133165 I'm just thinking like three or four maybe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133165_0133775 That would be a good... Really? I was thinking of like 10. No, it would have taken quite an hour.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133872_0133975 どうすんの?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0133975_0134636 I mean, the thing that did an HCI course a while ago, and it's just, that's what they, there's three people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134718_0134790 That was fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0134790_0135144 then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people. Really?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135305_0135407 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135407_0135572 We don't want to.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0135862_0136947 One dude on the street. And then one supposed to be the man. And then one...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137425_0137628 Good boy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137628_0137769 Mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137769_0137988 But if he finds them, then that's cool.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0137988_0138094 If it wants people.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138094_0138215 Okay. Bye.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0138516_0138578 We
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0139203_0139271 two weeks.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140242_0140610 I thought evaluation maybe for the report.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140610_0140752 Das ist der Nächste und der 25.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140752_0140882 25th of July.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140882_0140970 I think that's better.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0140970_0141080 Hattest du heimstang?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141247_0141500 I thought you said 20 for Bill.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0141500_0141952 Even though it's a good Friday. It's not a good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142066_0142163 Oh yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142163_0142403 Wow, it's not a good Friday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142418_0142656 No! What was it, Doris?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0142656_0143082 I'm sure on the website it says Thursday. Yeah, okay.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143247_0143567 So that gives us two days to do the... evaluation.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143567_0143766 No evaluations.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0143766_0143830 你懶得
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144144_0144408 I didn't think so necessarily.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144408_0144537 Je vous interçois.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0144537_0144643 But we shall ask them.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145641_0145965 Yeah, that's probably tight otherwise. Too good? Target.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0145965_0146120 Dzięki
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147092_0147205 Just try what you can get.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0147902_0148058 Cheers for a photo.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148058_0148276 It's just funny that I haven't finished my money.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148276_0148594 Because after Monday I'm pretty much free for about a week or so. Exactly!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0148594_0149073 It's like if we hadn't, yeah, bit more time.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149456_0149558 Από την επόμενη...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149558_0149960 See, I'm free after this Monday.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0149960_0150359 That's easy compared to what you did.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150359_0150594 I mean, I'm a reason. I don't have anything.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150724_0150827 You're a kiss.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0150827_0150890 なんでいません
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151378_0151464 真是
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151464_0151692 Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151692_0151764 아, 지효 씨
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0151929_0152096 Hehehe
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0152773_0153143 If that was us, then not him. Yeah, just that's fine.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153143_0153293 I love this song.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0153647_0153757 Yeah Thursday 24th.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154007_0154164 Is that mine for submission?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0154502_0154676 Oh no you can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155209_0155380 That's all for now, so you please...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0155884_0156315 Just to ask whether we need to have the valuation done for the demonstration.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156649_0156753 Uciechamy tam i...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0156753_0156839 Okay, yes.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157128_0157274 But it's still important.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0157274_0157747 Is that a part of the demonstration that they want that information? Yeah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0159586_0159628 over.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160781_0160938 answer a few little things.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0160938_0161185 just made some comments the last meeting.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161185_0161535 Just generally how it all integrates blah blah blah.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161535_0161657 Do we know?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0161997_0162216 I'd expect some more 10 to 15 pages.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162406_0162725 Although it's 50% of the mark I think is it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0162725_0162768 I'm sorry.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163174_0163343 Hope you have a bit of time to give me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0163473_0163524 It's not me.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0164978_0165201 Just to fine tune into detail.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165315_0165359 Bye!
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0165717_0166013 Yeah, that could be, that could usually be like, never subscribe.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169046_0169143 Okay, I'll be right back.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169143_0169262 Yeah, no big rush.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169501_0169604 Although just together, otherwise.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0169604_0169952 So, don't try to remember to do that tonight.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0171732_0172201 Just basic, pretty much like the intro. Do you want to have the intros then?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0172201_0172565 Just sort of like Google, actually, and just...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0173517_0173764 Eu não sei se que é uma coisa, mas é só...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174233_0174429 It doesn't do anything yet.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174429_0174744 That's like that's the other big part.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0174744_0175073 I mean how to get that communication between the two different kinds of windows.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175461_0175946 Because of things, if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0175946_0176441 That was why I'm sort of deciding to get the three pains in there instead of just the one.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0176699_0177347 Yeah, so there's a couple of those little things. Yeah, I can hear you. Beautiful.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0177347_0177529 Yeah, and makes more sense.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178574_0178779 Is that how it works in the ovens?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0178779_0179183 And like the other windows, like various like, different topics.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0179927_0180420 If you have a particular window that you want me to mimic, it's behavior.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180420_0180825 Then we'll just find it in the program and just say, okay, just have this one, does it?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0180825_0181051 So if it's like the topic window or...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0181663_0182241 So I can sort of trace back and figure out what objects they're bringing to you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0187581_0187863 So one left click just highlights.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188300_0188413 I would just let him...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0188570_0188695 the transcript or whatever it is.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0189392_0189561 İzikülü
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0190694_0190785 I should be close.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191221_0191242 you
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191550_0191944 Although, yeah, this wheel, this is actually different from how we printed up here.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0191944_0192057 like if we're doing global search
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192057_0192623 then we are going to do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192623_0192899 and then we'll either multi-select or...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0192899_0193337 Choose the one we want to actually do this. I think multi-slapped would make more sense. What?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193337_0193727 Well just um if there's like three of the top meetings like we said before
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0193727_0194086 language, looking for the word language and get the highest rated ones.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194086_0194615 Actually, look for the terms we're not flowing it out of all 76.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0194615_0195308 So the results from that will, you know, narrow down what we're going to use for the local search.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195308_0195571 Then we'll just do the local circumference ones that are chosen.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195571_0195821 Are you preaching? Well, I see what you mean.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0195821_0196372 So it will be a bit different from how that is right now. When we did the research at least.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197254_0197407 Yes. If not, you can't.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0197407_0197508 いざい
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0201665_0201959 So then we search to the...
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0202422_0202634 That's perfect. Fairly.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203017_0203143 Yeah, local anyways.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203143_0203227 Well, that's easy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203227_0203393 OK 回到目的地 再見
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0203393_0203597 That's crazy.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206489_0206636 Well, it's a good set.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206636_0206734 8000円
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0206901_0207310 Are we bothering with our topic stuff still?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207310_0207511 Or is that sort of like our own topic segment?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207511_0207760 Like since we can't do the labeling and all the rest.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207760_0207915 We are still doing our topic segment.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0207915_0208053 Well, what's that? You are. Do it.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0208316_0209096 But we're not going to be released. We won't be doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they don't have labels.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209233_0209491 All the label ones?
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209491_0209673 Yeah, I'm a level 2.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0209673_0209740 I'm coming.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210577_0210642 Thank you.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210642_0210701 Так.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210701_0210871 Well, no, it would be kind of straightforward.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0210871_0211092 If you're quitting, it's over.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218435_0218498 Probably not.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218498_0218791 I mean, just get work done.
AMI_EN2002d_SDM_MEE073_0218791_0218984 I think that's what I've got to do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001099_0001453 Are we? No. We're not allowed to get in lights so who can see it? I think this guy's...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0001887_0002029 question of the because of
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002237_0002381 Am I supposed to be standing up there?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0002986_0003229 Bien sûr.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008190_0008382 Hello everybody!
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0008382_0009196 I'm Sarah, the project manager and this is our first thing to surprising me in a
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009196_0009474 Okay, this is our agenda.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0009568_0010193 We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better, feel more comfortable with each other.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010193_0010814 Then we'll go do chill training, talk about the project plan.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0010814_0011589 discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got 25 minutes to do that as far as I can understand.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0011762_0012154 Now we're developing remote control, which you probably already know.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012154_0012699 We wanted to be original, something that people hadn't thought of.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0012699_0013201 it's not out in the shops. Trendy, appealing to a wide market.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0013201_0014283 but you know, not a hunk of metal. And user friendly, granny's to kids, maybe even pooches, should be able to use it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014283_0014958 Okay, first is the functional design. This is where we all go off and do our individual work.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0014958_0015940 ychydig yn ymdweud y bydd y bydd y bydd, y bydd y bydd y bydd y bydd, ac y bydd y bydd y bydd yn ymdweud.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0015940_0016094 and conceptual design.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0016231_0016780 what we're thinking, how it's going to go, and then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017038_0017203 Okay, right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0017203_0018410 We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard at the first. And so what's the characteristics of that animal?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0018883_0019207 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024322_0024433 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0024789_0025060 And I'm gonna ask these guests if they're gonna tell you that, so let's retire you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025453_0025724 And I see that as just it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0025989_0026225 and in it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0027231_0027542 No, like to come next.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028757_0028966 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0028966_0029010 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0035001_0035109 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0037384_0037686 Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today is there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039399_0039492 Keep it for that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0039631_0039980 He's gonna die. Why? He's gonna be alright.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0042011_0042095 太適合了
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0043985_0044177 Good luck.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0046109_0046216 Tentacle health.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0048966_0049134 I'm shaking.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0050119_0050466 Right, not a seagull.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0055448_0055515 Sim, sim.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056312_0056546 That was fun. Right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0056546_0057464 Finance wise we've got a selling price at 25 euros which I don't actually know what that is in pounds at all.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0057464_0057532 Any ideas?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058385_0058512 Yeah, that's right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0058638_0058798 Okay, das ist sensibel.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0059098_0059592 I think so, I think so. I'd be able to pull it up or I could put it in shared folders. Having said that...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0060813_0060929 So supposedly it depends.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061351_0061782 Yeah, production costs at 12.50, so...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0061913_0062426 Half of the selling crisis is taken out by building it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0062426_0062944 and profit aim is 50 million euros, which is that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0063129_0063642 Yeah, yes. I'm... yeah. I presume so.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0064913_0065029 than everyone using it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0065357_0066222 target group. Yes, yes. I don't think we have to, I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0066222_0066970 Making that key point, just that it's going to be an international market like Australia, America, things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067520_0067829 What are your experiences with film controls?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0067829_0068347 I mean, I've got, we got, we had three videos.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0068347_0069167 a TV and a sort of amp thing all set up. So we got one of the universal remote controls.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069167_0069939 that you program each of your things into but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to reprogram it every now and again.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0069939_0070270 I think it was quite cheap as well. So that might have had something to do with it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070270_0070483 but that was quite good, the fact that you could...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0070596_0070891 You didn't have six from a control sitting in front of you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073498_0073730 Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0073730_0075176 I mean, and you don't want to, I hate, I hate looking at control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the tele-text button or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0075743_0077073 When you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions when you can do sound or options kind of recording.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077073_0077283 things like that inside it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0077283_0077979 because it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at. It's obvious what you're doing.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081235_0081365 What about the older generation?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081365_0081509 Not bad granny and grandkids.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0081615_0082363 I have this little... My granddad can answer his mobile phone but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0082812_0083151 I don't think they teach me. Yeah. My grandad thought she better be.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0084120_0084324 Yeah. That's another.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0086430_0087174 I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that kind of got a windows based running system.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087295_0087683 I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the first
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0087683_0088287 I had not got a new one but my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0088438_0088517 That's just me.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0090577_0090750 with the text that that option was running.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091369_0091737 Oh, Warbank, kind of a dual function.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0091737_0092964 in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, program, things. And also, and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0092964_0093488 obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0094848_0095316 I think that's a cost thing. You don't know how much we're going to know about it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0095602_0095807 It's a little bit small.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0097097_0097935 Right, okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting so we're all going to go off and do our individual things.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0098120_0098951 I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back in days again and I get to do another fantastic part of my meditation.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102232_0102399 I break them, probably.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102504_0102689 I mean the sky remote controls and everything
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0102689_0103258 They're kind of moulded and look a bit different and the tail US remote controls are silver plastic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103258_0103865 The child looks a bit smarter so yeah I guess that's tougher than a belly.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0103865_0104156 Okay, so let's break out there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104313_0104416 So see you in half a year.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE013_0104776_0104904 We'll see you soon.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002515_0002683 I go back for these cookies now.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0002912_0003048 Yeah, good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0003130_0003339 Hmm.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0004975_0005318 The slice.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0030638_0030720 A kind of dog.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0035651_0036214 He's leaving me a face at the bottom of the top. Out of the top? She's standing on a chair.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0037680_0037894 Look at that, it's stundingly good.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0042144_0042234 Peace.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0044316_0044795 I'm very impressed with your artistic skill. Wonderful.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0044795_0045085 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0045400_0045694 Oh, there.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0045797_0046057 Oh dear.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0046538_0046851 Cut to the half tail, two handed fresh.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0046851_0047088 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0047441_0047935 I gathered it was off the chocolate mine, I was going to do a big gap too.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0048126_0048468 He doesn't want it to be.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0048877_0049141 I think...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049290_0049778 I'm in the body tonight.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049778_0049996 The dress of the one dear.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0049996_0050809 It's meant to be a seagull. Right, not a seagull. Who's been a seagull? How'd you go up with these?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0050809_0051149 There you go. Again, I'm thinking my feet. Goodness.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051149_0051612 You can also independent the development again.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0051612_0051866 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052028_0052492 Dependent. Do you think they could go? Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052492_0052624 Ego.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052691_0052920 아, 오케이.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0052920_0053660 I'll see the quite free suit, flying around everywhere.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054142_0054715 And first prayer, and do you be treacherous.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0054715_0054953 HMMMHMMMHMMMHMMM
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0055366_0055677 死亡
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058488_0058597 Something about
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058837_0058954 Should we be making notes of this?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0058954_0059174 Speaking to Shrevely to the side. I think so.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0059174_0059228 I think so.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0060809_0061392 So I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price or is it going to make our product look a cheapy cheapy option?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063037_0063120 in our first year.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0063810_0064823 You've got Market Range International and you did see earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups. We're not focusing on business markets.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0064823_0065111 any particular thing. It's an everyone, using it to everyone.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0065341_0065540 Big Target group. Yes.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071292_0071717 My experience has only been given the remote control with the object I buy.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0071717_0072244 not doing any tampering with it and programming, using it to program TV videos and things.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072244_0072768 but basically on or volume up and down, channel one to that basic function.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0072768_0073605 I don't think I could go any further with it than that. So I suppose I've got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Yeah, the main, that's...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0075081_0075529 Something like that, that you don't necessarily understand. Symbols are meant to understand.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0076852_0076898 questions.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0077978_0078326 Actually that just raises a point I wonder what our design people think.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078326_0078704 But you know on a mobile phone you can press the key and it gives you a menu.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0078704_0079448 I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be so you've got a little LCD display.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0080380_0080592 With menus. Yeah, with menus.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0082379_0082797 Can he program his remote controller? Is he basic with that too?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083464_0083927 So that's the problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0083927_0084464 That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation labs. And that's another issue I'm talking about.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0089871_0090564 Is it possible that for the older generation you could have an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0090564_0091178 Obviously it displays less on the screen, but as long as they can read it, that's the main thing.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094012_0094353 You can have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0094353_0094756 Your screen is, you can have a bigger screen and they flip over.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095678_0095860 Yeah, it's a poor project.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0095969_0096635 And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone. It can still be lightweight plastic.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0096635_0096916 something that's easily moulded and chews.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0096916_0097245 Sorry, I'm treading in your territory, God.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0100506_0100574 Sorry about that.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0100916_0101130 是哦
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101370_0101720 Like good, but yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be that
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101720_0101945 You know, that was my main point after using Meta
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0101945_0102210 I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper. I've seen it worth it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0102210_0102441 I break.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_FEE016_0104642_0104829 Do we go back to...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0031569_0031739 So yeah, it's the end of the year.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035348_0035555 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0035911_0036174 아오..
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0036174_0036765 अच्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छिएका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियका च्छियक
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037143_0037529 And also my drawing skill isn't that great. Well as you can see across the
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0037960_0038448 Okay, now I'm going to change what it was originally. That looks like a beak, I'll say.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039041_0039795 Crocodile?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0039795_0040627 Well it was an attempt at T-Rex and then it sort of changed into a Pelican but it can be correct.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0042120_0042597 Yeah, and I think I'm spot on for things that it is.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0042812_0043022 Uh... Scary.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0043248_0043437 uh strong
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0043874_0044199 Yes, I think it is.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0044523_0044668 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0049740_0049998 The truth of the world, yes.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0050176_0050322 Right, not a single...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0051987_0052095 They're gonna go.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0052430_0052863 Yeah. Ego. Oh, right. Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0057511_0057766 Thanks for watching.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0058085_0058757 Yeah, yeah, it's like, you know, so... Yeah, well, so... 15 pounds. Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0059419_0060321 Having said that, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market at the moment, they're about £20 anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0060321_0060809 So yeah, we have what I want.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0070110_0070188 Yeah
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0070518_0070672 You saw the one who didn't have to...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0071124_0071332 Yeah, c'est fini
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0082937_0083405 Yeah, my granddad thought she better than me at using tele-text, so...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0084373_0084958 Yeah, why it just needs to be as long as it's so self-intuitive and you can work out
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085098_0085279 Why everything's doing... Cause I mean...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0085279_0086194 menus on new phones now they talk all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0086443_0086588 I'm gonna add it.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0087018_0087069 Oh yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0088518_0089370 Yeah I don't know how for 25 or 12 Euros 50 how much of an excellent screen you should get
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0089370_0089931 You'd have to sort, keep it down to a black and white LCP thing anyway.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0097068_0097179 Bye.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0098880_0099666 Just a quick thing about the... What you're saying about the... Doesn't need to be fastable.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0099666_0100524 I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the we put the fashion into electronics.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEE014_0100524_0101484 So I think the whole design thing might be quite... Sure. I mean you don't... You can still have plastic in it, look quite good but...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0000037_0000176 You
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0006420_0006633 What the...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0008050_0008166 Okay.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028514_0028661 Business.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0028908_0029068 Bye, guys.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0029332_0029602 Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make.

AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0031914_0032186 Okay, I see it as one thing, it's very supporting.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032413_0032773 It's your best friend in you. You can talk to a dog. It can be a best friend.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0032773_0033136 And it doesn't discriminate because you're based on what you are.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0033136_0034096 Second is loyal and third is inclusion.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0034096_0035106 Tosca sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So basically these are the three unique features I think belong to you all. Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0035106_0035147 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0036433_0036784 अख़े ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये ये य
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0050178_0050267 Right.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057676_0057871 Let's buy a gift.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0057871_0058150 1.4 year old would make a lot of problems, wouldn't he? Yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0061754_0061959 이렇게 이렇게 이렇게 하시면
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0063639_0063710 you
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0069149_0069222 아, 네.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0070861_0071104 You want to decrypt everything into one place.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0075518_0075806 So, we should visit when they're...
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0078708_0078774 Really?
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079289_0079360 little bounce.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0079446_0080057 I was thinking of the same lines here instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080057_0080603 Maybe have a series display or something like that, like a mobile. With menus. With menus.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0080603_0081203 And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0081521_0081896 I have decided my granddad can answer his
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0094604_0094666 Okay.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095091_0095738 You know how much we're gonna know about... Might save up a bit of space and speed. Instead of looking bulkhead, might be small.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0095738_0095924 But you might have these cost implications.
AMI_ES2004a_SDM_MEO015_0104805_0104838 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000818_0000982 That's it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0000982_0001080 It's Gaze Black.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003704_0003883 All right, I'm good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0003883_0003972 Actually...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0005545_0005586 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0006681_0007420 Right, okay, um, just a second, meeting. And I might give it all over the place.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0007420_0007886 Right, our agenda for today. Do you want us to give you a second?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008127_0008353 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0008593_0008870 I'll go over what we decided last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0009263_0009912 We decide upon a universal control. One handset for all to be video.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0010181_0011216 that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0011216_0012023 We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, Rupert Flashin in electronics. You know, that kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0012023_0012947 Our budget would have to try not to reflect our budget that we might
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013141_0013633 I have a bit of... Oh, oh you can see it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0013633_0014340 dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014485_0014869 wanted to look uncluttered and daunting to look as to me.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0014869_0015936 We discussed a flip-open design, reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming, things like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016324_0016680 Three presentations I've got in here, so...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0016866_0017062 Shall we hear from marketing first?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017503_0017732 No, that's fine. That's fine. Okay, yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0017907_0017982 And parking.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019400_0019512 M.S.N.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0019596_0019726 Action, I vote.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0033828_0033873 喂
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0052766_0053017 They're very, very much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053017_0053235 Would you like to continue from there?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0053591_0053854 You can't really miss that chance.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0059477_0059630 Function at best.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0061274_0061355 No.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077551_0077886 I think we'll chat with you at the end.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0077886_0078435 Okay, so if anyone wants to write something down, they want to be in the end.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0078855_0079091 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0079260_0079339 Oh!
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080268_0080336 On va...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0080959_0081103 You just did it, that's it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084130_0084197 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0084490_0084543 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0103869_0104058 Right. And...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0104172_0104485 We had new project requirements.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0105110_0106034 We're not going to be using teletext. Part of the consumer is considered outdated with the internet now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106240_0106856 our control is only going to be for TV, it's not going to be combined control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0106856_0107844 which limits in all of the different things that it limits the cost for us but also makes it easier to understand for us.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0108057_0109180 Says for TV only, so looks like it's just... yeah. I think maybe Sky, things like that, might be incorporated into it, but...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109419_0109550 I don't know what do you think?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109550_0109781 It's just that for TV only.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0109781_0110213 That means general TV controls do do video as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0110444_0110888 I mean you also get combined TV and videos.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0112245_0112700 I think we assume that it's still got show and start functions and programming.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0118844_0119020 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120074_0120646 We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0120646_0121783 So I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing because it is something that it needs to be the thing that you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0121865_0122367 Used to find it needs to be something that you don't lose. So you're just me whistling.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122367_0122886 Maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0122886_0123385 you go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123385_0123711 something like that but that sounds a lot cheaper too.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0123800_0124766 The third thing was that we have to make sure the copper image is very much incorporated into the handset.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0124766_0125253 So we want logo, we want...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125490_0125856 fashionable, trendy, I mean what you were talking about with the marketing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0125931_0126371 and people paying more for it to look good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0126492_0126781 We need to focus on that as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132038_0132750 What about you were talking about the buttons? Yeah. The controls that are coming out now have kind of big
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0132750_0133469 rubber buttons, not tiny little big rubber buttons, but want it back. I mean, because we got to make it original.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133620_0133736 What about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0133869_0134201 We know with the touch screen computers.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0134432_0135394 So it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either. Not sure about that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135518_0135840 You don't have to press it, you just have to put it if you want it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0135840_0137075 I think that might appear, I'm thinking kind of Japan, thinking young office people, trendy.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137206_0137531 but quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0137531_0138564 easily labeled so that anyone can say, oh yeah, that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0140284_0140357 Não se esqueça
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0145256_0146158 I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146158_0146540 or they can make it bigger or they can change features slightly.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0146796_0147715 It's going to be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0151286_0151974 or a speech recognition which is extremely expensive. I think that's the only way that you can provide
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0152084_0152177 back in a way she
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0154752_0155002 We are talking about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155203_0155496 the type of company that we're working for as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0155496_0156520 that they want it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume, associate that with the older generations.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0156520_0157418 Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0157418_0157983 But I don't think we're focusing on that. I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0158124_0158361 business kind of class type people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160471_0160942 Okay, so the remote control functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0160942_0161612 We've got the TV, we've got the video. Now there's...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0161750_0162392 I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of program details. Video plus. Yes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0162580_0163755 We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that. I always found that really easy when I discovered it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0163884_0164486 because you've got your general record anyway so if there's a program on you want to put record on.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164486_0164979 That's fine, but if you do want to tape something in two days time, you're not sure if you're going to
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0164979_0165402 you put the number in and it's just a number. It's not a date, it's not time
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0165402_0165877 It's not channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that, it's just number.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166423_0166641 You've already got the numbers for tapping anyway.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0166940_0167575 is after if you look in the newspaper or TV guide or any TV guide there's a five
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0167575_0169104 six digit number afterwards and that's number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at 10 o'clock on the 17th things like that so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169104_0169455 And it has been around for a long time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0169712_0170288 No, it's not. I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0172221_0172299 오케이, 자.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0179443_0180041 The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your TV's not doing it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0180125_0180592 taking your TV and your controller and saying, look, this is what I'm doing. It's not working. What should I do?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181366_0181542 Pat, mais c'est après que...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181827_0181972 Instruction manuals.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0181972_0182307 But I mean there's customer service.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0182307_0183125 There will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0183125_0183634 Just no extra, the person has to walk to a shop on the high street.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0184469_0185430 But we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little variety and lots and lots of pages.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185430_0185816 It does. You just have to enjoy it until something goes wrong and then you try and search for it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0185816_0186123 So that should be something within that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186123_0186346 what other functions
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186346_0186957 We need, I'm not sure if we need a design decision now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0186957_0187714 But we should think about... because you've got the dilemma between old batteries, that's what I was thinking about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0187714_0187922 What about phone batteries? What kind of battery is that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0188854_0189772 Well they last quite a long time and if you had the thing that you get with their mobile house phones
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0189772_0190169 You sit it in its charger when you're not using it or at night or something
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190169_0190674 but it doesn't really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time once it is charged.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0190674_0191003 Something like that should reduce the space.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0191820_0192107 Yeah, it could be on that. Yeah, as well. Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0192773_0192946 rechargeable with the documentation.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193074_0193261 So the recharge voltage to be here
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0193952_0194291 Yes, which is cheaper in London as well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194291_0194770 the shape you've got trendy.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0194770_0195498 I don't want a big box with lots of things. You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0195498_0196249 because then you have got the repetitive strain engine, no matter how much you try and make it simple.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0196609_0196676 TATYPE
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0197718_0197875 Okay, so we've got a flip screen.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0201381_0201563 So you kind of look into your hands and...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0202640_0203026 Can you look into the company logo?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0203150_0204079 things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204079_0204130 I mean...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0204322_0205260 For example, if it was a sea or something like that, you could have it in a vague sea shape that opens up kind of like a shell.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0205260_0205875 or something, something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0206040_0206644 obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that's there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0208341_0208598 Well, we need to think about how it is going to look different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212165_0212769 Or you could do different, like you get with mobile phones, different flashes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0212769_0213100 You could have different kind of casings.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0213100_0213867 You could have psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0216498_0216776 Right, I think we have to round it up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0218236_0219067 That was in cutting down the number, that was kind of set, but that was cutting down the number of functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0219067_0219618 Making it simpler, instead of having lots of things, you want to impress the program.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0220670_0221444 What kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221444_0221589 doing it could be
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0221657_0222602 Yes, it could be an advertisement feature rather than design feature. You know, draw attention to that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0222671_0223557 and also paid lip service in the instruction manual because it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0224964_0225675 We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0226198_0226844 And we've talked about there being an alarm or something, a bee pain from being lost.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227005_0227308 Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0227308_0228085 There aren't going to be that many functions incorporated into it, so it should be fine. And I do instruction manual.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228085_0228384 I don't know if we deal with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228594_0228670 I think...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0228984_0229266 Yeah, and different from what's out there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0229266_0229414 Yeah, I think that's us.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230012_0230375 I think you might get guidance but...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230550_0230564 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0230717_0230976 instruction manuals because it tends to be a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0231160_0231851 Demonised thing, everyone's got a big pile of them but no one really uses them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0232414_0232555 Yes, right.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233087_0233150 It can...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233342_0233739 I think you can email me if there's any more questions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE013_0233929_0234196 I'll now be able to know answer them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0004768_0004918 Good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0008031_0008152 I don't know, that's okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0017101_0017584 Is it okay if I postpone that till later? I just want to get access to a little bit more information. No, that's fine.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0031970_0032302 Can I interject to ask the question? Yes, sure.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0032302_0032675 You think the display battery is a small, like other cats? Um, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0033595_0033876 those batteries in.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0034157_0034256 Well, just wondering
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0051715_0052358 That's a very important point. It came up in our market research findings too, so I can refer to that. Alright, okay. I'm going to be like a person.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060486_0060728 I think that doesn't come out of it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0060904_0061000 И текарство
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080309_0080569 Oh my God, it keeps us here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080569_0080653 count.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0080875_0081185 You have to meet the state.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081185_0081594 I'm gonna push it a bit more.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081594_0081740 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0081740_0082067 Yep. Yep. Yeah, this is my name.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083136_0083235 Is that okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0083679_0083990 Thank you. Can I just say a little bit?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084171_0084387 じゃあ、はい
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0084563_0085725 Okay, I'm going to look at the functional requirements from your marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0085725_0086149 So that's where we started. We used our usability lab.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086149_0086670 the company's usability love. We did our usual selection methods to get across sections of the general public.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0086670_0087219 male and female, all age groups from 15 upwards and we observe them in the lab.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087219_0087626 Just their general use of the remote control. You can see we had a hundred subjects there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0087633_0088097 Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarized some of them here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088097_0088814 The overall thing which I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0088814_0089076 that has obvious design implications there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089076_0089559 Mae'n 70% o'r pwysig o'r pwysig yn ymwysig o'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfrifio'r cyfr
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0089695_0090332 80% would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. We were quite surprised by that finding.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0090332_0091220 But that's quite a high proportion of our international target, that we are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091220_0091790 Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0091790_0092588 For example, you can see below there 75% of users zap a lot. So you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel bopping.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092588_0092783 So again, that's power implications there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0092792_0093454 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons so again a big design issue there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0093454_0094252 and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0094690_0095591 The biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier. Remote controls are often lost in the room.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0095591_0096272 mae'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0096272_0097238 34% of people take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the previous finding of people only using 10% of the buttons.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0097238_0097521 It just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0097607_0098356 Slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0098356_0098896 You know, the small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0098896_0099689 Mae'r ffaith yma yw 35 o'r unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unrhyw unr
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0099689_0100431 Felly, mae'n ddod i'r adeg yn ymwneud ymwneud yw'r cyfnod rhwng. Mae'r cyfnod ar gyfer y rhan.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100431_0100548 something we didn't put to the
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0100548_0101364 which I'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again until you find it or a blushing light.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101496_0101820 That trend reverses in the older age groups.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0101820_0102050 The 35s and undersea would like those two features.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102050_0102645 Mae'r cyfnod yn 35-45 a'r gweithio'r gweithio'r cyfnod yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0102724_0103167 I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you but I think I'll just keep it simple
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0103167_0103614 If there's any more information I can email you with extra details. Is that okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0107683_0108058 So can we not program a video with this remote control?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0108448_0108535 It's just
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0109768_0109931 without any general TV content.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0110866_0111006 就算是延安的去搞
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0113429_0114281 We didn't really look into that, but remember we found that finding that most people only use about 10% of the buttons.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114281_0114818 I think that those did tend to be the basic channel hopping things of them and offer the video fast forwarding.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0114818_0115453 and so on. And I think it's of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0115453_0115669 I don't know if that's something we need to...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0116582_0117240 In fact, I just called up that table there. We asked those two questions. The table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0117240_0117928 Would you prefer an LCD screen, that's a multifunction remote, and would you pay more for speech recognition and remote control?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0117928_0118404 So you can see how the yes and no sort of varies across the age group.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0118404_0118899 A substantial number of don't know in the older age group. I think that's just general fear of new technology.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0119631_0119703 Eh, well.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0123366_0123469 It's something like that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0126734_0127142 Wow. For other market researchers we needed to focus on what that is.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0127142_0127782 Mae'n ddweud yw'r 15-yrsio'r 60 oes, ac yn ymweld y Rhaenmiad Ynysgol.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0127782_0128591 What is attractive to a trending New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African from, I don't know, you get the idea.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0128591_0128772 it's going to vary around the world.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0128772_0129154 At the end of the day, the engineering design is one thing.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0129154_0129967 It's the user interface design that may, and the sort of fashionable aspect of it, we might have to change the different markets around the world.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0137001_0137251 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0138337_0138495 Generation.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0146528_0146951 The internal engineering design has got to remain the same. It's going to be the same.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0147756_0148224 I'm concerned when you raise the RSI issue again with positive strain injury.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148224_0148581 I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148581_0148982 I think that is still a kind of question or issue how we deal with that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0148982_0149485 RSI tends to be caused by a bit of small movements.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0149607_0150179 I really can't get my hair dry on this one this meeting. People spawn to a future meeting but it's something we should think about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0151052_0151322 I know, I'm the trans-beginner here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0152211_0152875 Do we have to initially, you know, looking at the findings here, focus on
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153020_0153426 yng Nghymru yn ymddiolol, ac yn ymddiolol yn ymddiolol yma.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0153426_0153757 Do we really have to go for everyone right away?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0154265_0154787 Mae'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'r idea, mae'n meddwl i'n meddwl i'r busnes, ymgyrch, ymgyrch, ymgyrch.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158340_0158878 I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too for when it does get to the broad-scale marketing stage.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0158878_0159335 If you want to not waste money, not be profligate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159538_0159772 in a focus on where the idea will be taken up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0159772_0160276 first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0166569_0167039 Again, anyway. And look across that function, it sounds wonderful. It is after it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0167960_0168027 ¡Ares!
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0171461_0171636 Excellent.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0172320_0172808 Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me? I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another.

AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0173473_0174307 That's kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with their design features. Chain companies like Carrefour Warehouse
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174307_0174740 Rwy'n cael ei fod yn ymwneud o'r ffun o'r ffordd yma, mae'r ffordd yn ymwneud o'r ffordd yn ymwneud, ac mae'n ddweud o'r ffordd yn ymwneud.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0174740_0175078 the company, you can use their telephones.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175078_0175985 Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0175985_0176511 If they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, which button is it I press for this?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0176511_0176914 Mae'r ddweud yma yn ymdweud yma, dwi'n meddwl yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdweud yn ymdwe
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180470_0180828 If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0180828_0181323 But I mean, if there were any more, or if we absolutely definite it's only going to be for TV and videos.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0181323_0181622 Ja, ich bin sehr aufgeregt. Bis das auch.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0184190_0184550 We should
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185334_0185586 That's people of reading them. It does. They just enjoy it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0185840_0186028 That should be something with them.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196261_0196662 And we don't want so many remote controls look absolutely identical, do we?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0196662_0197058 brown things with the same coloured buttons all crowned in on the surface.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0197058_0197764 We definitely, an obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles. We don't want that. Okay, so
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0200379_0200552 But then I'm actually kind of thinking, curved over here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0206780_0206923 that button.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0208703_0209017 I think that's... that sounds a really attractive idea.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209017_0209569 It's usually like that. Anything like that before, if it kind of, yeah, and that opens out into your flip top.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209569_0209833 Then it's nice to help you make it lightweight plastic.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0209833_0210338 nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210338_0210880 So that's going to take care of some of the padded strain injury, try and prevent a lot of it, I think.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0210880_0211441 I think it's a really nice idea. Yeah, we're the winners. Plus, you can get... Even though we're using plastic...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0211441_0212121 You can still, when you think of the design, you can get in plastic. You can do a nice conch shell or a scallop shell exterior.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213830_0213973 Let's chance of it being lost.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0213973_0215162 It's not like a chocolate brown lasagne that's going to go down the sofa. People might want to put it on their man-top, so whatever it looks attractive in on as a kind of warning, and they're not going to lose it so much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0215162_0215553 These are a bit nice to handle.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0216798_0217196 Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0217196_0218132 There's no teletext, it's only for TV and by implication video. Corporate image should be incorporated in their remote control and... ...something about video plus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219412_0219960 Thanks for watching, press the program and you can come up on the LCD reminder by using video plus.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0219960_0220091 that they will look at the guidance.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0220232_0220665 oedd yna ni i gyd o'r ymddiad o'r ymddiad?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0221346_0221738 that I'm doing a really good economic feature.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223519_0223739 and every chargeable battery.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0223739_0224192 Was there anything else there that the new project requirements?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225709_0225935 That's not the moment of requirement, it's something we're looking at.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0225935_0226310 Yeah, so we come round to market research at some point and we've talked about
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229455_0229731 What would you specifically like marketing to look up for the next meeting?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0229731_0230004 I shall not just so generally look at all the issues.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232273_0232423 Ups, kalsi nie, to...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_FEE016_0232530_0232698 See you next time!
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017650_0017791 Okay, I'll go fast.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0017791_0017931 Hello. Crap, see you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019155_0019224 Press
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019224_0019332 No, wiesz co?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0019684_0019789 Boom.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0020998_0021062 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021250_0021849 This is the working design presented by me, the industrial design room there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0021996_0022501 Okay, this is where I went a bit mad with Pathway inside.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022501_0022885 What the first thing question asked is what are we trying to design?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0022885_0023358 Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change the state of the device.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023358_0023844 whether that be the power or the channel or the volume.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0023844_0024692 Everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliances sending the signal to you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0024903_0025738 And so I decided I'd have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0025738_0026006 But although we will want to be taking...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0026148_0027208 ideas from other people, we want to make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that, well it wasn't really my area because...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027266_0027489 I'm dealing with the inside really.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0027489_0028055 Same. Yeah, I ran out of time so I can do this one. Fun is the last one.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0028055_0029482 And I found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because there's a cost issue of something like the same thing that can be used
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029482_0029852 Well, listen, you don't need to send very much information.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0029852_0030249 Most of them are powered by some form of battery.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030249_0030387 Now R1
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0030387_0032173 I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by AAA batteries but those can be quite bulky so I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032173_0032222 Yes, sir.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032558_0032617 All night night
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0032617_0033253 If you look at most remote controls, they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033253_0033769 They have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0033769_0034754 Yeah, you can get the circular round once, just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the detra cross.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0034754_0035461 which leads to one to the next point about being small and easy to carry around.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0035461_0036032 Now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if you could look at something a bit smaller.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036119_0036880 Mae'r bwysig ymlaen o'r cyfnodd yn ymddangos, ac yn ymddangos y bwysig yma, ond mae'r bwysig yn ymddangos.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0036880_0037334 As I said about the which batteries we were going to choose
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0037334_0039212 You can discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0039212_0040149 Now these have a wireless range of up to about 5 meters which is so suitable for anyone who's watching their TV unless they're in a cinema.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040149_0040724 But not most people do, so that's where I find the most audience that should be fine.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0040724_0041786 And then I just had a quick look at the X-SAML design but I left that mostly to the interface designer.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0041918_0042276 And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanted to do.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042276_0042828 It's not a proper circuit. I'm not sure if it will work or not.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0042828_0043307 I'm not even confident that that's the real way you fly it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0043307_0044180 I've just got the power going to the infrared bowl with the chip and the UI interface.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044335_0044440 which would basically
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0044440_0045351 When you've pressed anything, the chip would convert it into some form of IR data which could be decoded by the TV receiver.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045351_0045881 Which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0045992_0047240 Why the communication of TVs are already using and since that's another reason to use infrared because that's what all TVs use.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047240_0047388 And then finally...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0047388_0048772 We want it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are at a low cost so that should be good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0048772_0049534 It should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049534_0049953 we've talked about it before and also just something that I was thinking about.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0049953_0051225 Because they're small, they're also easy to lose. So if we could look into some there, I don't know, some anti going down inside the sofa. Thing that you could have.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051225_0051707 Mae'r ddweud yw'r ddweud yma.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0051707_0051903 A very important point that came up.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0052171_0052865 Alright, okay. And yeah, that's what I came up with there.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0059548_0059679 Function of that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0060745_0061098 My eyes are assist.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0078292_0078370 Черт!
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0082660_0082831 Okay
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0083072_0083098 you
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0084009_0084398 Dziękuję.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0109929_0110099 Charles. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110365_0110586 I just want to try to do it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0110905_0111510 If you've got a Skybox, one of these SkyPlus boxes then...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0111510_0112232 And you can record straight off the TV anywhere, say, onto the TV in our drive or something.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0115583_0116633 Just as an idea on the speech recognition thing, it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0116764_0116844 We are
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0117659_0117763 more for speech recognition.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0118863_0120080 But on that again I just thought because you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is. So I thought that could be better.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0130630_0131204 Like, yeah, you could have a number of different designs. I mean, inside they'd be essentially exactly the same.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0131327_0131716 Just if we just could be same in the body, but we look slightly different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0134069_0134462 Yeah, computers. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0135290_0135625 Share it while it's night, because you wouldn't have to eat that much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138496_0138917 but also ergonomics as we're saying of the different designs.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0138917_0140603 economics there's sort of physically different things because if you've ever seen the Xbox they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the control was physically too big because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0140693_0142376 They're cut just generally, Japanese people have smaller hands and they can go in the controller which is... So if you... I don't know what, because obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0150192_0151305 I was just thinking about how you could combat that because without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the challenge.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0151424_0151723 which is extremely expensive
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0154022_0154151 तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो तो
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0162240_0162351 Video class.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0163198_0163315 Yeah. Is that?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0164781_0164911 I think in two days time you're not sure.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165687_0165894 Anything like that is just a number.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0165894_0166237 And you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0166237_0166555 Yeah, well, because you've already got you've already got the numbers for
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0167185_0167280 newspaper or TV.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0169347_0169912 It's been around for a long time. It's just it's not very well advertised. No, it's not.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0170330_0171457 If you've built something like Sky anyway, you can just press the button on the program once and it will record that program. When it's on and you press it twice and it will record the whole series.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171608_0171863 So, yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0171863_0172203 but just have that function be really good.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0177063_0179451 But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you sign for a contract so the companies who you deal with have actually they've got an obligation to help you out and also I mean it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I'm not sure how much the cost would be Right
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181345_0181412 Yeah, thanks.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0181639_0182014 I mean, instruction books, that's it. Instruction manuals.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0182540_0182649 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0184229_0184510 It's a simple function.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0185403_0185487 你整個還在
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0187956_0188561 And they're specially made for the mobile things.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0188561_0188987 But they come with a charger, I mean you could, you could bundle a charger. Well they didn't like, they didn't like.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0190909_0191734 Yeah, and if you had one of those, just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting up the blooper in the room there, could...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0191928_0192056 Yes, yes.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0192552_0192970 Yeah, some sort of docking station now. We charge both with a docking station.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEE014_0193338_0193963 Yeah, yeah, that would be fine. And also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out and die in batches all the time.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0053624_0053899 Maybe we should start to do it.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059104_0059321 Okay.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0059321_0059379 See you later.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060255_0060416 Ммм, на сетях.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0060673_0060814 Let's cut my eyes open.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0061620_0062515 Actually some of my points might overlap with what Valium just mentioned. But basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0062515_0063547 This took up a valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think will take a feedback from the marketing because
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0063691_0064255 I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064255_0064919 So purpose as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make it as simple as possible.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0064919_0065298 And to summarize I would say it should be user friendly by being easy to use.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0065404_0066192 rather than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering driven maybe having 100 buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066315_0066622 like volume control or channel changing the channel over the
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0066741_0067462 But we have to make it unique so that people want to buy it. We'll punch in these two features together.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067462_0067737 So what the concept is to have a flip top model.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0067737_0069035 The main functions such as which are often used will be on the top and the complex functions which you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to program their favorite channels or whatever.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069035_0069351 Then we put in the middle part of the flip top.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0069351_0070654 So it's like it could be accessed by a wider range of audience and we can punch in new features such as added features such as shop proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0070826_0072814 Findings most people prefer user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote controller for say a year or something and they have not used maybe 30 to 40% of the buttons. So it's not of no use of punching in those trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse a user.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0072814_0073649 As we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economy of a higher production like 50 million we said. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0073649_0074378 With that I think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also. So we can add more features and make it less cost free.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0074762_0075212 That's so this is if you ask me personally I would make a
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0075447_0076762 So, talk with the trendy design and maybe we should look at also like the buttons whether they are like soft or little hard because the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0076762_0076903 So overall it's simple now.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077084_0077176 user friendly design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0077302_0077469 Any comments left?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080345_0080468 I'm going to keep this here.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080544_0080661 You can't.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0080727_0080950 You have to discontinue.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081300_0081424 I'm gonna push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0081928_0082028 감사합니다
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0083436_0083550 या तो तो लेटा वागा
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0103476_0103651 details is that okay?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0112627_0113386 Programming yeah anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0114090_0114129 10%
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0130021_0130539 So are we talking of a single model or maybe 5-6 designs?
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0131349_0131665 The features could be same in the body could look slightly different.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0142436_0143060 Maybe it was indicated the risk of repeated views.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143060_0143427 the injuries maybe your touch screen could be a better option for that.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0143672_0144196 So, you are dividing designs based on not only segment H2
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144196_0144633 your design dividing it according to the countries also the market
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0144633_0145286 Maybe for US and on you can have a slightly bigger remote and be in Japan and on you need to have small
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0153750_0153940 We could focus on the biggest market.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0154040_0154364 I have seen people between age 20 to 35.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0183560_0184036 I think I'm going to need too much of an effort for a person to, for a phone maybe he might drop down this train.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0184036_0184327 But for a remote, he will just report to the manager.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0192253_0192616 So are we talking about the concept of rechargeable stuff? Yes, I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198282_0198846 What I was thinking of design which Nokia came up with almost 607 years back.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0198846_0199279 Basically, we have a flat one. It looks like a box, like a chocolate.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199279_0199946 That's very strange because your thumb is slightly up. So they can move with something like this. Covered up. So here...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0199946_0200218 and you don't have to, you don't when you come too much.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200218_0200588 So it's like a, you can say a banana-flavored kind of thing curved up in the boat.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0200744_0201169 So what happens is you don't have to press it from too dumb like
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201249_0201901 So it's already curved up so you can't see it. So we can have a... like you know mold it according to your...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0201997_0202359 the way you hold off its kind of semi-circular in the bottoms
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0202482_0202746 I want to see exactly how this would look like.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0206728_0206856 We could look in that part.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207096_0207273 What we were talking is to make it more...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207410_0207989 See how the logo could become... See if it could put a logo in the corner of the model.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0207989_0208367 rather than you know trying to make it like a sea-shadow or whatever you can
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0209025_0209098 pour que je me reste...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0211055_0211171 Nie ma wychwyry, to to nie jest...
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215455_0215628 या वे वे वे कुड कमेट सम्से फाइ
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0215628_0216163 designs and then choose which are which are appeals like that could be the most common design
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0216283_0216461 We can think of five six reasons.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0226542_0226773 Thank you for being lost.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0229030_0229156 Un différent de moi.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232357_0232411 Снег!
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232559_0232680 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004b_SDM_MEO015_0232928_0232967 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0000002_0000202 I'll wait till you're all there. Do it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0005239_0005447 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008008_0008387 Welcome back everybody. Love you've had fun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0008544_0009352 Right, and this is our conceptual design meeting. I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0009477_0009969 from the last meeting. Yeah. I think, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0010104_0011160 This is where we talk about properties, materials, user interface and trend watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011269_0011501 So I think we've touched on a few things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0011664_0011891 to do that already but we'll just go over it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012298_0012602 The minutes from last time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0012602_0013372 We had a couple of changes in our plans in that community is teletext.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0013372_0014280 it wasn't going to be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0014472_0016044 We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition. We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016044_0016539 We were thinking a shell, but something along the sides, just a different shape from what's normal.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0016897_0017210 You are going to look into the rechargeable batteries.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017331_0017939 And we're going to think about the port and alarm for getting it lost, things like that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0017939_0018862 And our market is going to be young business kind of range.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0018862_0019193 Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0019193_0019284 Yes, if you think.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0024946_0025060 Cachinha, quem é esse?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0035729_0035965 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036149_0036391 Let's start from the inside and work our way out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0036755_0036949 Yeah, thanks.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0037104_0037309 Yes, thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0038856_0038972 I hate these little things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0039096_0039596 especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the lube courage on them to undo them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0049745_0049886 To be honest people want
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050012_0050260 This is the wind up radio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050494_0050799 How long can you get out of that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0050799_0051223 I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053146_0053294 When? When he's got two...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053378_0053790 What was that? It was Q, C.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0053961_0054086 Hey
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0055701_0055969 I pretty sure the sailor is from the sun.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056054_0056835 I don't think it counts. Electric lines, no. But I mean, that's not many... You don't want to limit your market.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0056835_0057300 I mean people who live in basement flats, there's not that many people. But there are people.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058059_0058272 But then it would be charging to the day
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0058272_0058872 I think the point is they charge you through the day and then you've got it charged. But I think, I think.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0059540_0059632 Yeah, I think.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064002_0064729 But then if you think about watch it's on your wrist, so it's on your body the whole time. Yeah. So you're walking around.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0064729_0065014 you're doing things it is moving a lot of time.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065014_0065289 If you switch the TV on, then you put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065289_0065588 then you pick it out to change it and then you put it on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0065588_0065718 Then again.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0068177_0068398 It's not the drone, is it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0069823_0069960 A plus !
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071616_0071774 expensive as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0071774_0072311 What price are we looking at for? I presume that normal batteries are the cheapest.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0074029_0074161 de son
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075002_0075156 I think, yeah, right.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0075916_0076308 They turn them. But don't care because they just have a battery in them. Yes they do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080189_0080629 Okay, can we add in an attachment to closing feature?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080799_0080978 Can we think about that?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0080978_0081433 Because if we're doing the kinetic thing, and it's...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0081629_0081912 Well, I didn't think about it, so I...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082370_0082509 Where am I?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0082509_0084553 If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape, the kinetic is something people don't do, kind of, we're doing something original and different, but if you wore it, if it's something you could just clip on your pocket, then you would have that less.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084553_0084817 you wouldn't lose it so much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0084951_0085271 But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0085412_0085659 the eternal battle for control of the earth.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0087163_0087235 Okay, right
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091816_0091988 What kind of things do we have to consider there?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0091988_0092807 Can we... what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size? Well... And we would have to fit the... ...qualsities.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0111147_0111276 for the flip side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117621 So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off with the rubber.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0117621_0118084 Like those pens that you get with a grip that you can build now.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0118872_0119263 Well that's been really popular with my headphones so I don't see why not.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0129140_0129293 Oh, you speak so much? Yes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131235_0131449 I think it would be good to have a contrast between
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0131449_0132237 If the whole thing is going to be this rubber thing, it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0132237_0132764 Now how would you distinguish if you had a bear? How would you distinguish where you had to press?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0134328_0134463 So you can't
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0135045_0135233 that we have to replace as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137437_0137923 Okay, we'll talk about that. So, should finish here, come back to that. Yeah, that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0137923_0138131 That's the end of the video.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144155_0144495 We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144866_0144989 Well, it's a rock and roll.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0144989_0145772 you're sick watching TV yeah are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0145952_0146152 Yeah, I think that's it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0148283_0148597 Very quick, I see you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0155824_0155938 Graphic
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0160946_0161428 Can we swap that round so that the ones that we use are timer on the bottom part?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161564_0161743 if you think about holding it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0161877_0162283 You would be using your thumbs to press? Just like a mobile phone?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0163533_0164442 That's what I was just saying. And then have the LCD at the top and then be able to touch that for the other key trends.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0164442_0165203 It has the volume and the program, things like that. On the lower side. Perfect.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0175745_0176007 I can't see that's that playing, stopping things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0176145_0176343 Is that volume and volume?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0179203_0179843 I'm not sure how long I've got left, but we need to make a decision about...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180107_0180200 I think we discussed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180270_0180650 So, we agree on...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0180781_0180899 Do we agree on the battery?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181306_0181831 That means that there's no function for the port.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0181831_0182425 you know that it sits in and press and button and having so we could incorporate voice recognition by finding it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182425_0182687 It's like a gadget.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0182807_0182892 set their points.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0184800_0184921 I think the only...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185031_0185833 I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost. That means we have to cut down somewhere else.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0185833_0186520 But I think pretty much we've used cheap, relatively cheap and simple things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0186520_0186655 And as it is not true.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0187652_0187765 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0188079_0188197 Then you don't really get it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0189165_0189312 Do you want like a backup?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191274_0191588 Okay, so I forgot the battery.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0191588_0192062 The inside components are pretty standardised across the board, isn't it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192189_0192592 So there's not really a decision to be made there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0192808_0193128 the buttons. What did you give us, Esso?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0193474_0193716 The bareboard, LCD... Yeah, damn.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0194471_0194948 On the top point, okay, you've got the touch. Yeah. Okay. And then...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0195625_0195847 Okay. Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0197336_0197415 Нёс!
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0198156_0198256 Put it inside
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0199200_0199392 I think so, I guess.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0200704_0201858 No, I think we don't want to be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway. The fact, the material that we would be using would be cheap.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0201858_0202008 So we could make it red.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202008_0202770 We could make it psychedelic. We could make it black and white zebra stripes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0202770_0203384 But that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the, you know... The theme. Yes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0203384_0203662 So we could just pick anything.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0205521_0206423 That's just different. It's different. It's just different from everything else. I mean, I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0206423_0207105 sort of beige and blanic. To you either want something that goes with that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207105_0207294 Which is what's on the market anyway.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0207294_0208360 Or you want something that contrasts as, you know, like, you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock. Because they're so interesting.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0209428_0210011 and you would just have so many different options that you could do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0210011_0210708 You could have a plain black one. You could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your lips.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0211630_0212456 And once the ones that have rubbery spikes, you know, you could just go so far over there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0212456_0213177 like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so I think that's quite a yeah flexible and finally the ball
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0215226_0215710 Okay, I've got five minutes. Um, well that might have been after all though.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0222133_0222216 I love you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0223557_0224476 Well they do but I think we can... Is it the one that is kind of on the market? Well it is, it is. I think you just address that with advertising.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0224476_0225035 you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225035_0225419 obviously it'll have a look on it just like everything but everything else has a look on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0225419_0226057 The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently, but I think it does without that, so I'm not worried about that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0226877_0227640 Depending on how... Yeah, depending on the expense of it. I mean, we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company is looking into, so...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0227763_0228698 That seems to make sense, but if it turns out that it's huge expensive, we'd have to cut that somewhere else. Then it's worth thinking about.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0228698_0229151 But I think we'll find out more about Ghost afterwards.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229151_0229325 Right, I'm going to record that thing.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0229632_0230258 And got an end meeting now with you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0230519_0231255 So I think we've probably got, it says closing, we have 40 minutes. So I think we've probably got about that time before we come back.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231436_0231523 Is either that or...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0231623_0232110 We only had 14 minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE013_0232570_0232677 Is everyone happy?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0001757_0001913 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019124_0019210 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0019333_0019451 Just connect them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0020110_0020144 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021791_0021898 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0021898_0022800 Okay, so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0022936_0023239 The methods we use to decide on
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023460_0023678 current trends and so on, market trends.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0023678_0024933 We did our usual market research study with our hundreds subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most, I'm sorry, slightly untied after a month
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0024933_0025119 カチン カチン カチン
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025119_0025656 We decided on the most important aspects required in a remote-controlled device and we'll come to that later.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025656_0025849 So that was one of the first things we did.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0025849_0026370 Also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0026370_0026908 We also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0027029_0028144 So the general findings from that was in market trends, the most important aspects for remote controls were, people want a fancy look and feel,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028144_0028599 rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0028599_0028955 They also want a remote-controlled and technologically innovative
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029089_0029420 And of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029420_0029974 Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0029974_0030639 is twice as important as the second technologically inhibitor, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0030783_0031218 So possibly the feature that we put first is actually third, it's still important.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031218_0031695 Third and order of preference then the subject of the look town.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0031695_0032413 The fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0032413_0033086 Mae'r cysylltu yn parodd yn mylion, mae'r cyd-fasio'r ffyrdd yn ymddi.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033086_0033505 Fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0033505_0033912 So she could be thinking of using something like that in a remote control design too.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034013_0034785 There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy field to materials, again in contrast to last year.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0034785_0035432 So a lot of interesting feedback there, both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris in Milan.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0035432_0035654 It would be interesting to see what our design people make of that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036543_0036742 I want to say one of the questions about that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0036742_0036901 Maria, too. Thanks.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0039387_0039590 Very childhood, indeed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053232_0053491 When he's got T-Ring.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053491_0053571 Nice.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0053916_0053999 Até o final.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056191_0056303 I like to fight.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0056527_0056624 That's not many.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0057116_0057532 But there are people who prefer to market internationally.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0068504_0069132 We're going back to solar charging. Is that compatible with standard batteries?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069132_0069148 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0069148_0069726 Could people put standard batteries in but they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charge? The two things are not compatible.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0071449_0071648 Thanks for your boo
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0076735_0076799 And the question is,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0079650_0080160 Which is the attractiveness of the whole feature film. Yeah, I think it would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0081231_0081853 Shouldn't we do some research on that first before we add it in because I will add it in to think about it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0085715_0086369 It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research. It's not a thing that people are looking for.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086484_0086645 and you still have to do the field.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0086804_0087020 I'm going to put it on the side to think about it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115209_0115444 It doesn't really matter if you let it fall.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115444_0115944 I've got mobile phone myself, which is to tie in with it. It does mark very easily. You can drop it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0115944_0116500 I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that's super... Rubber, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0116500_0116979 But it gives the sponge a feel. That also allows us to have different fangs. And you can peel them off.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0117431_0117601 I'll for the treatment right by us.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0118463_0118836 Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128514_0128876 I don't see why the curved thing is a problem.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0128876_0129431 If we, for example, had a show... Yeah. Oh, it was to be flat inside. You could have a flat screen inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0129595_0129708 But I'm just wondering where the-
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0132981_0133449 It's another idea, I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133449_0133915 Is it possible just as an option? When we open up, people can use their fingers to press the button.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0133915_0134516 Or we have inside like a small pointer thing. Yeah, you can have some sort of stylus that you can pull out, but...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0135041_0135232 that we can replace as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0136802_0137175 just thought they wouldn't actually need one in the cruise anything they've got couldn't
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0137175_0137398 I pencil a pen to beneath a pen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141328_0141902 Just to raise another point, that kind of applies to both our designers here, not sure how it would fit in.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0141902_0142008 If we think openly
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142008_0142721 Now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142721_0142795 ¿Qué signos?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0142893_0143138 and they kind of respond to the turn of your body.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0143138_0144102 Is it possible that when we open our flip top shell, it's a little compact mirror, and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display, the off-demand control display then?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144533_0144638 That's how they're famous, huh?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0144773_0144835 Just a thought.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145341_0145424 I will put you here
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0145424_0146099 Because I was using the idea to remove my phone to kind of split my phone in half without I think.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0146202_0146611 Rwy'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud y byddai'n ddweud yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn ymgyrch yn y
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0148117_0148530 I think I'll be forget about the Marylap which is very quite fancy.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0155760_0155881 I'm Sub-Chain.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162257_0162492 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162703_0162747 विन्दी
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162747_0162868 Any other idea?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0162868_0163243 If we just use the show as an example, you open that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0163243_0163660 You've got your LCD display there and you've got the buttons there. That's what I should do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0188370_0188958 We talked about kinetic charging, we seem to have decided on that. Did we decide on double or triple A batteries?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0189425_0190016 One of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double E or triple E batteries because they still got to be charged this way. No you can't.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190016_0190091 Stick ones come
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190507_0190607 Okay, go.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0190840_0191062 I want you on that one too.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0195977_0196170 So could you repeat that last one?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0196365_0196464 You've got the place.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0198820_0199377 So we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell. I think so.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0199597_0200180 And it is just always rubber nice and spongy. Apart from that, we're just going to go for a vegetable and fruit collage.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0200180_0200831 not going to try and make actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else for sure. No, I think I do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203180_0203228 the film.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0203764_0204429 This is not going to be the image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that, maybe about that size.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204429_0204917 made of plastic, fits into the power of the hand, rubberised cover that's spongy.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0204917_0205635 Is that really going to fit fancy looking feel which was the major thing that people wanted? That's just different.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208230_0208684 I'm just kind of pushing it like if you could come out with anything else, but I'm not totally agreed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0208684_0209080 We look to ocean woods and they are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0209080_0209463 This would definitely be different enough. I just want to really look and come up with something.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210551_0210871 What's the other reason for it to be so real, to be cheap to produce?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0210871_0211662 If in a huge time you get feedback from the design fears that something else is coming, it's so easy to produce that, it can be slept on.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0211662_0211788 Позвольте.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0215644_0216382 So can I just recap, Sarah Searle? For the decisions that we've made, can I take charging the watch type batteries?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216382_0216871 LCD ydy'r cyflwyno ar y gweithio y flipp.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0216871_0217586 rubberised buttons on the bottom side. I'm going to use food and vegetable colour to the rubber cover. The case itself is plastic.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0217586_0217853 That's how far we've got, Wales, do we have to add to our decisions here?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219094_0219334 So are you looking at voice recognition?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0219334_0219636 But it's a good idea, we just need to check on the cost. Or maybe later.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0221703_0221964 I'm incorporating the company logo.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0222656_0223061 Because I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223061_0223585 It's not just a case of having a little R&R fitness somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0223838_0224119 You can't say what is kind on the mark. Well it is, it is.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226150_0226432 Did we... I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0226432_0226842 I think that was you talked about a deeper location. Have we just rejected that in Peter and Alistair's recognition?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_FEE016_0230669_0230756 It says,
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0009601_0009826 Yeah, I was going to get a question.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0036429_0036582 या प्रट्रेज़् विश्टेट
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0038097_0038352 This is for you.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0041188_0042252 This is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042252_0042507 Okay, first, the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042623_0042742 into the method
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0042742_0043948 The main idea of the whole thing is just so you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0043948_0044473 Also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0044473_0045055 because some of the things that we looked at last time unfortunately are available.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045266_0045596 Findings, I've got my nice little picture there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0045596_0046596 This is the chip called the TA-11A35 which is what's used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0046596_0047486 based on your input and it's pretty much useful all TV remotes at the moment.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047486_0047853 And then we're looking into battery options.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0047986_0048454 There's, um, can't see no rechargeable option available.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0048454_0049370 So I saw the standard AA and AAA which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0049370_0050219 Dynamo charging, I thought that might be a bit silly to be honest. It's basically like wind up radio.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050219_0050626 So you've lined up your remote control for years now?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0050626_0050702 كنب هالي
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051215_0051688 Yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it for very long.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0051688_0052412 But I don't think it's really necessary when you think of the next two options.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0052412_0053316 like the silver charging because most people have the light on in the room anyway so it could get when you've got tees in.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053691_0053742 plaisir
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0053742_0053910 Alright.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055103_0055725 Yeah, it would. The dynamo would take more space because you actually need a physical hand to wind up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0055977_0056085 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0057514_0058039 Yeah, most people also watch TV in the night.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0058725_0059062 So I think the next one is the best anyway.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059062_0059834 the kinetic charging which is like you get it in you get it in wristwatches and you you don't even notice it
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0059834_0060386 I mean the amount, the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0060386_0060805 I don't think you'd ever need to have Cthibbock East start safely enough to make it work.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0061351_0062662 It charges into some form of a smaller cell which it charges into and the size of a watch battery.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062662_0062874 because I use them quite frequently.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0062874_0064041 And that would last for... Well, I'm not entirely sure how long it would last, but I've never seen one run out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0064990_0065140 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0065538_0066039 Yeah, but then again... I think it is because if you think about it then what?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0066039_0067333 although it's only a tiny amount, it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out overnight when you leave them on the side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067333_0067624 and for the same reason.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0067624_0068678 you're only using it for an incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it. So it's not the draw on it? No, no, I don't think the draw on it would be.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0069582_0070774 Mae'r ddweud yn ymddiadol. Mae'r ddweud. Mae'r ddweud. Mae'r ddweud. Mae'r ddweud. Mae'r ddweud. Mae'r ddweud. Mae'r ddweud. Mae'r ddweud. Mae'r ddweud.

AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0070774_0071499 If you, like, on a calculator, they're quite big and they all look identical.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0071725_0071915 They're expensive
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0072299_0073132 Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I presume then it would actually be the same of charging ones but the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073243_0073799 I think they're not very resistant to dropping.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0073799_0074827 Because if you've got stuff, yeah, if you have the size you'd need to charge a remote, it wouldn't be that big, but... I mean, if... ...remotes always get thrown around and stuff.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0074990_0075189 I think, yeah, practically.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0075365_0076057 I mean, it calculates as you don't really throw around a lot. Whereas remotes, you do.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0076239_0076697 Yes they do, they've got dual things but the batteries are smaller I think.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077618_0077833 So yeah, so it is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0077962_0078479 Yeah, if you had something using the standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078600_0078967 batteries and the solar charging.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0078967_0079783 I don't think you... I think that it would... Well, you know how long the standard double A's would last in or triple A's would last. It would just detach from your shirt.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0079932_0080195 Yeah, I think you would.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087220_0087329 Let's go, I'm gonna go
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0087485_0088899 My second part of my findings, the most current remote used this silicon PCB board which printed circuit board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0088899_0089550 which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0089550_0091768 it will connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this LED in a sequence of on and off bursts
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0092714_0093013 Well, the thing about it is...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0093157_0094354 that they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print a circuit board like that. It's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the size of the nine buttons in.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094354_0094603 If you see how thin the tracks are...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0094603_0095211 You could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0095211_0096216 if you wanted to. But there is an option to do it like that, or you could have some sort of
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096359_0096753 Array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit. So that...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0096908_0097666 And then to...uh, yeah, so to consider about you guys, the remote should be in a standby mode while I'm not being used.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0097666_0098463 Now what I was thinking about that was because sometimes when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0098463_0099218 So you can see all the buttons I like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than I do on a TV remote.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099218_0099999 But you could have lights behind the buttons and after like 5 or 10 seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0099999_0100304 if we decided to go for buttons that could light up.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0100491_0101417 The case material I've been sent what the factory can actually give us.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0101417_0102327 There's the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway. That's the main case housing.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0102459_0103250 The main problems with the... well you could go forward but I think it would be a bit impractical.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0103250_0104324 Titanium, very expensive, just the process which, to make it, is expensive and rather...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0104324_0105188 Well you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year so perhaps something made of rubber
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105188_0105650 But I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0105785_0106024 They've per-crossed.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106153_0106991 are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0106991_0107867 I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0107867_0108482 And the problem with the casing is that there's
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0108608_0109417 quite, there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109417_0109818 if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0109818_0110496 Whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more... They can do sort of curved shapes.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0110496_0110920 But whether or not, because we'd had it in two separate units.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0111136_0111242 for the flip side.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112321_0112383 Yeah, I t-
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0112823_0113240 Yeah, in Titanium I don't think it would be available at all really.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113240_0113765 the g- just it w- well you could make it available in the titanium
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0113765_0114170 It would be so expensive to buy a new case for it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0114170_0115100 because of the expense of how much titanium is. It's light and strong, but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115243_0115311 for my
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0115672_0115851 Yeah. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116388_0116511 rubber yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0116863_0117008 as you can peel them off, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0119373_0120482 Also, just going back to the interface size with the buttons, we were planning to do some sort of touch screen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0120482_0121957 Now what I was saying before about, instead of having, you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and say, just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122071_0122465 over if you had them close enough that would be one option.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122465_0122835 The second option, they offer rubber buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0122835_0123831 but I thought that an LCD type of screen, because one, they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0123831_0124958 Two, you can have them in a sort of a ring. You could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing. You could have them like a touch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125432_0125558 Uh, what?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0125910_0127015 Oh, on the LCD screen, you could fit it. The problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curved things with it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127015_0127827 But, um, you can, you wouldn't have, with the LCD, you'd have the wires coming off. You wouldn't have that with the...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0127940_0128210 With the LCD you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0128504_0128659 Oh, so it's a...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129264_0129906 You can have a flat screen inside. Yeah. But I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0129906_0130571 It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white. But there'd be touch, touch buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0130571_0131188 So you wouldn't be pressing down, or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-RSR.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0131618_0131678 It's gross.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0132839_0133139 Yeah, I hadn't really thought that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134130_0134192 Yai, il fait...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0134192_0135048 You could have some sort of stylist that you could pull out but I think they could get a bit easily lost. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0136768_0136855 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0137738_0138096 Yeah, that's the end of the video.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0138991_0139069 아, 이 팝핏
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139363_0139573 Yeah, yeah, that would be fairly simple.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0139573_0140740 I mean you'd actually have two separate circuit boards where they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0140740_0141112 Because in the actual flip, I bet you'd have some linking.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0146938_0147093 I mean you can't, you could do it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147093_0147921 you could have a... because if you just put the full charge through an LCD display or completely blank it out.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0147921_0148233 But I don't know if she could get any mirror effect on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0156418_0156912 If you have buttons that appear on the screen and this LCD screen.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0163508_0163805 That's what I'm just saying.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0174354_0174537 Well, yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182295_0182473 Yeah, I think it's...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0182707_0183573 Yeah, it is quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got these parts already in stock.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0183573_0184148 then it won't be cheap to remanipathing. It will be cheap, so to remanipathing.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184148_0184662 So do you reckon that's a good idea about where's the remote? I'm here, think.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0184662_0184793 I think that would be cool.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0186500_0187432 Yeah, the LCD's not cheap. Well, it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full color, because if it just got black and white one.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0187432_0187668 When they use them, can't you like this?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189054_0189228 But he went...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0189926_0190502 No, the kinetic ones come with this sort of battery that goes in the watch.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0190615_0190857 So it's a lot smaller than that so it's...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0193636_0194134 Yeah, boom. I think we're going for the LCD on the buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0194134_0194770 On the top one. On the top one, okay, you've got the touch. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0195004_0195515 On the bottom we're going to have the rubber ones, the anti RSR ones.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0196178_0197020 Okay, on the flip screen, the top one is going to be the LCD and the bottom one is going to be the rubberised butt.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0198019_0198162 Prasta.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0200605_0200649 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0212137_0212251 He could just go...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0214132_0215132 Yeah, yeah, with these rubber, these rubberised, not the actual plastic outside, it's just the rubber. Thank you guys for watching.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0220154_0220323 Oh yeah, yeah, it was so much.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0226986_0227165 Yeah, depending on the expense of it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0227609_0227779 They are going slow.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEE014_0229935_0229994 Good.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0008247_0008327 You're not paid for this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0036430_0036499 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054083_0054598 Regarding the sizes, which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration sizes also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0054598_0055216 So maybe it's standard triple A might take less space or dynamo might take more space.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0060854_0061353 And how this like what are the life of the kinetic battery like it transfer long time
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0064027_0064066 you
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0071528_0071765 Expensive as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0072058_0072205 I presume that a normal b-
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076724_0076992 And the question is like, sorry.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0076992_0077461 Which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be charging like a mobile phone every day.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0077596_0077934 or you got control like so yeah so it is look at the light
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111124_0111763 So the blitz right? Yeah, and second question is like mobile you can change the cover Yeah, put it on the skin or whatever
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0111763_0112363 So in this case if you are looking at like the customer can change the color like from green, bright green to chilly red or something like that.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0112363_0112923 Is that feature available in Titanium or is it only specific to plastic?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117608_0117718 Like those pens.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0117973_0118068 दक्र दियो दे या
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0118192_0118395 It would be comfortable to hold on to.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125060_0125310 So I guess we buy the last part in darkness.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0125566_0125997 just what you said adding with the meaning of it completely yes i know
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0134989_0135328 I feel like you had to replace as well.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0135328_0136485 And he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button like.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0136485_0136741 if you keep punching with a point over over
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138042_0138503 There's no small machine before like you're listening regarding the circuit since we are having a flip top
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0138503_0139147 Customize the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top complex buttons in the listening
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0139147_0139304 So we can divide this okay like this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148592_0148738 Okay.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0148998_0149237 We have to share something which I did here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149237_0149677 First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0149677_0150290 especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150290_0150802 Second is we check into competitors. The picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0150802_0151570 So you generally see there's not much of variety and marketing teams said people need trendy, they're bored of black and white.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0151570_0152116 So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152292_0152729 And second thing is there's too much of confusion here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0152729_0152905 no particular remote is standard
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153118_0153286 Like some people have a...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153441_0153591 Heal? You see this?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153591_0153741 This is on...
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0153858_0154292 I thought that the only common feature is the channel control and volume control.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154292_0154798 Rest other buttons, they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models and all.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0154928_0155214 Okay, and second as already discussed with William.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0155214_0156212 We are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the middle of the flip top and graphic user interface, basically which is what we do in computer.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156212_0156505 have icons or touchpad over them which is if yes
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0156891_0157538 like you have an icon or something, you have, is a good example of which are you traffic user in Truyaz.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0157634_0157921 So basically a person need not point or click on it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158012_0158431 Press any particular device, it just has to click on that particular icon.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0158431_0159281 And on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means user button.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159281_0159776 So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequency of
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0159878_0160312 So we are having a combination of both. So on this simpler board
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0160312_0160780 on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164344_0164499 the K-translucent.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0164949_0165076 and the logo is on the lower
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165076_0165165 No thanks.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165562_0165774 So the findings are too many cluttered buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0165863_0166384 The repetition of certain patterns which I have already explained, examples of volume and channel control buttons.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166384_0166613 All are confusing and inconsistent.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0166613_0166912 Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a male
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167049_0167557 which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0167557_0168273 We have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at low cost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0168273_0169125 But for like we had a response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169125_0169527 So it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers I am here. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0169527_0170446 some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170446_0170664 and technologically innovative also.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0170898_0171243 So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0171623_0172153 My personal preferences would be like as already I did with marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172153_0172555 They want something to do with fruit. So I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0172555_0173179 But yeah, we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors or red chili. Yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0173301_0174236 to matter right over and second thing is certain standard buttons we should have. For example if you see the previous slide
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0174609_0175151 I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0175151_0175720 So we will not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176016_0176429 This is the central one? The one? Oh, is that the volume and? Yeah, I'm blocking my channel.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0176429_0177106 So keep that standardized because that's the most common feature across all models. If you look at all the models, it's here.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0178082_0178157 двойственные.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0181014_0181081 God is
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0187746_0187925 Maybe we could start with the black and white.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0188073_0188307 Yeah
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197144_0197260 and for the
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0197709_0198266 For the body design I think plastic. Plastic. Yeah, I have tried to use the body.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0198266_0198782 For the inside, you have rubber as a padding or for the grip, something like to add to the design.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0199172_0199264 just right there.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0205544_0205727 It's just different.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0212288_0212491 So, how do you know?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213084_0213742 and finally the body should be detached from it, maybe you can change the body or the case kissing, the case of the body.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0213742_0214102 It should be molded with the design in such a way you can change it overnight.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0214919_0214966 There
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0218025_0218991 Fine, we are talking of voice recognition also because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate remote control if it is lost.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219083_0219306 So are you looking at voice with it?
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0219578_0219981 or maybe like a very misadjusting and last thing some devices you put on keychains
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220136_0220425 Oh yeah, yeah, the whistle, bro. The whistle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0220425_0220813 So we think if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0222260_0222540 So, I am matching the refilling, incorporating and the design.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0230257_0230355 Again a question now.
AMI_ES2004c_SDM_MEO015_0232171_0232396 I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0000368_0000686 If you leave them on, how time it gets looks like a noodle the whole time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0001995_0002074 자
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002393_0002526 and three, apparently.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0002738_0002856 Okay, I switched it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003272_0003390 You were good to go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003390_0003552 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0003664_0003952 minutes and we decided to use a kinetic charger.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004093_0004564 standard shirts and it can come in various different sizes so it wasn't
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004709_0004997 It's going to be a problem factor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0004997_0005194 We wanted a standby function.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005194_0005672 The case interior can be soft, rubbery, changeable.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0005672_0006122 buttons with a combination of LCD and rubber according to the design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006122_0006812 bright funky designs inspired by free keeping with the hip kind of feel
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0006812_0007631 and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0007631_0008203 and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-RSI.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0008858_0009029 prototype presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0009260_0009381 I think that would be you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010325_0010586 Do you wanna hold it like? Do you wanna hold it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010901_0010995 Yes, yes, you can.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0010995_0011086 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012537_0012988 Stefan asked things and nothing just take her out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0012988_0013135 you
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0014172_0014215 네.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0020953_0021050 and the buns
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0021493_0021601 Alright, I'll be right back.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0023326_0023877 So put it in the top section rather than the bottom section because it's the top.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027237_0027350 Wir sind ein Tierzimmer.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0027464_0027593 I like it too
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0032909_0032972 バイキー
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033289_0033662 Actually no, it would be your type of video. Yeah, only your front, your front side.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033662_0033840 Alright, yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0033980_0034152 So when you've actually got it open it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0034235_0034335 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0039904_0040303 but not interfering with that... No, not acting. ...and living with that product. No, not at home.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041343_0041510 Thank you very much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041653_0041912 Bracking it all up. Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0041912_0042199 I've now got evaluation criteria.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0042707_0043170 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0045226_0045415 It's quite similar to what it was before though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0058297_0058533 Just right, Molly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0060141_0060204 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0063692_0063765 I would agree.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0064951_0065004 That's it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0069602_0069659 I too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0072117_0072286 It's just 2.5 for that one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0075853_0076076 I would say too.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0076076_0076158 That's it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077244_0077443 1.7 the latest violence.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0077443_0077562 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0087136_0087889 Well the type of button that we're going to use in the bottom half, the material, the minimising x-ray science meant to.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088191_0088855 Maybe because it's slightly with the size that we've got. It's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0088855_0089231 So maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around to the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089313_0089572 Okay accurately the buttons in between.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0089572_0089900 It's quite obvious, just big buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0095822_0095902 and stand your step.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096148_0096209 It would be
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0096383_0096845 And if you didn't hear it in the room you were standing in and you realised it wasn't in that room, you go into another room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102140_0102218 I don't think so.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102431_0102558 I think we are here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0102558_0102627 a tips on
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0103784_0104040 Thank you so much. Apart from having a huge bake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105024_0105081 take this out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0105433_0105566 Okay, thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106383_0106722 Okay, I've got finance here now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0106722_0107058 I'm going to plug this in so you can all see it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111261_0111373 Now I presume...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111556_0111672 That scream of good night.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0111791_0111963 that um
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0112668_0113201 We just type numbers into this and we come out of the final bay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113201_0113484 So are we still on for kinetic?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113715_0113995 See, it would have been handy to have this at the beginning.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0113995_0114217 It might go into their choice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0114509_0114789 Right, what's happening with the electronics?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0115794_0115886 Zapomnę.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0116994_0117120 Oh right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117520_0117628 So it would be two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0117973_0118028 晚安
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119130_0119210 One depth of care.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0119730_0119868 So what's a single character?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0120288_0120438 So just one double
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0121644_0122034 We've got plastic and rubber, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0123290_0123329 present.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0124483_0124648 It would be like saying we're using.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125074_0125261 See, it says case material.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125385_0125843 So we're not actually using plastic in the case? No, no, that's...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0125843_0126008 It's including. It's including.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0127840_0128124 Okay, we'll just put it in, we'll put it in his half.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128357_0128636 Which just put it in as one because plastic zero anyway
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0128938_0129220 We don't stuff anything with tubes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129220_0129394 Okay, special color, do we need that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0129643_0129734 to coverage.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138235_0138315 웃음가가?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0138315_0138673 Oh no, it's 7.5, it's changed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0139863_0140057 That's not a calculate.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140280_0140355 Okay, there we go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0140434_0140639 And sliding? It's annoying.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0141642_0141956 We haven't been dealing with dollars there I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142112_0142400 Okay so the highest we've got is the electronics here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0142723_0142945 If we add the interface
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146296_0146349 Where's the-
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146444_0146567 Where's the voice recognition?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0146864_0146956 Right, I can't remember.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147212_0147361 Well the kinetic is three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0147361_0147641 If we change it to the batteries, that's minus 3.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148023_0148079 Alright.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148079_0148241 Keep seeing you soon.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0148868_0149309 We can do it some other way. We can do it. It doesn't have to be voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0149309_0150037 We could do the voice recognition for business class or something, like an upgraded version.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0150037_0150218 You could choose to have a lot.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0151326_0151659 So should we just change it as a misrecognition thing?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154493_0154605 Okay, we can...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0154748_0155625 make the price fit and then say if we had our budget we would have had this because it also sets apart because we've done all the background work
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0155625_0156026 They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156026_0156347 It's some complete different associated with your company.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0156347_0156467 Right, okay, so...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157505_0157721 Was it 12.25?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0157721_0157907 No, it's 12.25.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158190_0158482 Yeah well it's two, 12.25 times two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0158669_0158815 I'm sorry. I'm already going to
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0160463_0160841 The popular gender one was where the price was, wasn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162262_0162338 12.5.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0162645_0162720 You have some people?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163089_0163418 So, is that got us covered for the electronics then?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0163418_0163680 We don't need something else to take that place. No.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0165733_0165921 Great, so we've done that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166372_0166561 of perfect variation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166692_0166948 We've done room for creativity, haven't we?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0166948_0167513 Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we won't, didn't feel able to make.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0167748_0167997 I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168536_0168736 in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0168915_0169188 Did you feel like a teen?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0169188_0169806 Or did you feel like... I would say it's a team. I think it's a team.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173184_0173296 여기
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0173296_0173446 How did you find it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0176832_0177869 I like the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that there wasn't the best idea but no one felt like shopped down.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0177869_0178399 You know, it didn't matter saying what you thought because if it wasn't something that was that relevant.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178399_0178669 and it didn't matter because it was just another idea in the field.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0178669_0178828 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179060_0179486 while you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0179596_0180250 I know that was the best part of the program. I'm still not caught up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0180250_0180551 That's nothing to do with the teamwork, so...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181444_0181597 Yeah, that was quite fun.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0181597_0182055 And means, whiteboard, digital pens, etc. What does that mean?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0182055_0182133 T'es bien ?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0183562_0183667 had time to kind of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184151_0184614 Yeah, cause we could just sort of say, sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184614_0184842 other than having to email you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0184842_0184984 But it was nice having it there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0185103_0185350 like the whole picture of the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0189996_0190296 Yeah, I think it's the idea is more from other areas.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191575_0191709 And now,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0191709_0191888 Well they have to come from somewhere, go see.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192020_0192299 I don't have to ask what sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0192299_0193197 As was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, no one thought about it particularly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193197_0193678 I mean, they're slightly different, so someone's been shouting in the room and said, Maycar is a bit different from everyone else's.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0193678_0194216 because there's something we should think about but obviously no one's putting a great deal of thought into it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196176_0196984 But then when everything is really smart, and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0196984_0197713 I mean, if you could have something that's proper, funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0197713_0198494 I mean they could even go into, you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0198494_0199206 You'd pay a lot extra because it's individually being plastic with being made for you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199206_0199556 But people could never have anything that they wanted.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0199712_0199792 present
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0203973_0204308 Well, it's innovation for money to say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204308_0204544 that people have to keep forcing it onto people.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0204806_0205290 And you can get, you've got your hands at the works fine, but you can't get battery anymore for that type of phone.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205290_0205582 Because the phones had moved on, things like that. There wasn't a cover to fit it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0205778_0205904 Thanks, man.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206223_0206361 In closing...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206460_0206619 끝
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0206619_0207514 and our costs are below budget with recommendations that the budget be increased but I think I don't know what do you think
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0207514_0207752 Do you think that takes into account...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208156_0208471 like us being well paid kind of thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0208471_0208983 and the heating for the building to think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209312_0209994 So it looks like it's going to be 50% profit. You've still got all of your overheads to come out of that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0209994_0210623 So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price of the egg. So don't.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0210623_0210881 I think but you're saying that that's quite
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213317_0213646 She won't get me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213646_0213744 Really, the optimistic
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0213744_0213984 You have a deal, fellas.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214271_0214736 The project has been evaluated well and truly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0214736_0215214 And if you've got the meeting summary in question, then you'll find the clue.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215214_0215890 So we've got about 50 minutes to catch up to everything that I've felt behind me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0215890_0216450 So I'll be delegating it. I am the Royal Ads Project Supervisor. So good luck!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0216954_0217203 I think the celebration is the 25 pounds.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0217288_0217464 I probably will be dancing on the dance.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0218479_0218677 The air just lasts, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219181_0219500 I think I've got minutes for two of the meetings and...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0219619_0219703 Must be
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE013_0222167_0222225 И я скачу.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0001511_0001599 쏘라
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0026214_0026708 I'm done. Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0041713_0041806 Okay

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0045600_0046975 This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0046975_0047249 So this is the first stage of the evaluation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047249_0047547 Now the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0047547_0048158 ac yn ymwneud o'r cyfnodd ymwneud yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyfnodd yn y cyf
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048158_0048619 So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting. Are we actually meeting those trends and requirements?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0048836_0049116 Now the findings that we came up with just a recap are here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049116_0049991 The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy looking field, technological innovation, it should be easy to use,
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0049991_0050845 Mae'r cyfnodd yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol, ac mae'r ddweud y ddweud yma yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol, ac mae'r ffordd ymddiadol yn ymddiadol yn ymddiadol.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0050845_0051764 Mae'r ddweud yn ymddiadau'r RSI ac yn ymddiadau'r cyfnod ac mae'n rhaid i'r ddweud yn ymddiadau'r cyfnod o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud o'r ddweud

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052504_0052880 Okay, so we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0052880_0053466 I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053466_0053913 We're going to use a 7-point scale where 1 is true and 7 is false.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0053913_0054337 We'll look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll pull that slide back up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054337_0054894 and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054894_0054982 Does that seem clear?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0054982_0055080 Any questions there?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055241_0055377 So we're going to look at these.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0055519_0056226 Yes, we will discuss each one and we will come to our consensus region between 1 and 7.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056226_0056304 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056304_0056520 One is true, seven is false.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0056932_0057098 Don't move from the left, okay?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057098_0057436 It would just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A, B, C.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057436_0057767 A C D E F to give you the ability.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0057767_0058075 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0058075_0058416 For nothing to react to.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0059577_0060022 Actually it might be an idea if we each did give our own division rating because they have the end.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0065410_0065609 I'll follow. Okay?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0065609_0066132 As you know that we've got 6 and 5 11 divided by 4 is what?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0066132_0066551 Is anything good? I'm free.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0067192_0067463 She's quite seven-fives, there we go.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0067463_0067945 Felly, ychydig yw'r cyfnod, ychydig yw'r cyfnod.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0068080_0068370 I wouldn't give us a room.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0070532_0070718 I just thought it was a good idea.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071037_0071182 Is that what you're saying?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071496_0071665 So we're having a hard time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071665_0071800 It's very sluggish.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0071959_0072177 Okay, good boy.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0073734_0073991 I'm going to change the rhythm.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074155_0074366 Okay. Easy, easy.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074366_0074483 Easy to use.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0074599_0074946 Based on what you said there, I'm saying one. True.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0079543_0080152 So I'm just thinking, before you do the narrating, you were limiting the use of materials for your approach and type here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0080152_0080387 Is this actually got to the policy? No.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086309_0086708 You talk about a point which is very useful in our control. If you're someone who's that...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0086708_0087178 sitting with her and asking her, how do you minimize the anxiety?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0089981_0090294 I think I have to be in each room again.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0090814_0090958 好 再見

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0092947_0093561 Yeah, it was
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0093733_0094033 Voice recognition.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0098582_0099508 So we've got our own, we've got the highest rate of meeting specification, that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0103308_0103946 On the basis of current technology and our current capability, we can actually do much.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0104500_0104817 Is there anything you would like to ask me about it? Bye.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0107225_0107291 To jest.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0119481_0119693 Rwy'n gael y ffordd yn fwy o'r ffordd, ac mae'n gwybod.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0124069_0124247 What does it mean if you put 0.5 here?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0125948_0126093 I think we did.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0127172_0127484 There's nowhere else we can count for the rubber used in the casing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0127484_0127676 So do we not have to account for it in the course somewhere though?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0129433_0129934 We might do, for example, figure out if some of them were exotic or original and such like.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0137735_0138224 Does that not mean that if you click off that square now, it doesn't mean any difference?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0138224_0138383 分かるのかな?オーナーセンター

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0139563_0139785 That's not what you're doing, is it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0140346_0140507 I've got it done slightly.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0141636_0141773 We haven't been dealing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142747_0142880 If we had to enter.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0142988_0143645 If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just spent the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0145029_0145509 People are used to meeting people. If you take away the boys, I don't know what to say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0146166_0146338 Do we see what difference it made?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151180_0151459 But we're still working to... So should we just change it as a...?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151568_0151710 in our recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0151710_0152186 If we're working to head off the specifications, this is what this project team is working for.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152186_0152756 Mae'r rhaid i'r cyfnoddau ar y cyfnoddau a'r cyfnoddau sy'n gwybod i'r rhaglen.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0152756_0153037 But we need to work to that specification to start.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153037_0153309 I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153309_0153981 But our object is so distinctive that that in itself is going to make it easier to locate as if in a first instance.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0153981_0154491 Mae'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r cyfnod o'r

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0162791_0162873 So where are you going?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0169656_0170315 Oh we had a special thing with two of us. There was so much interaction, so much that we needed to and... find out. ...selfie each other.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0170315_0171238 And I certainly felt heard, listened to and that in relevant areas we've been able to give and take and adjust our remit if necessary.

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0182059_0182550 I hope to get to discuss which ones.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0182690_0182872 Could it have been better? Was it adequate?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0190085_0190483 It's bringing things from other areas.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0190483_0190922 I mean nothing is new. It's applying it to a different area.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0191831_0191944 I'm certainly at
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0196007_0196202 Yeah, but it's like, oh, did it, right?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0201108_0201817 I think this has been very market research based because just going back to mobile phones

AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0202851_0203137 There are innovations in that that people don't really want.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203137_0203687 I see people wanting a model of the phone they're really happy with and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0203687_0203961 And I think it's wonderful that our company is so R&D based.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204421_0204579 but forcing it onto people.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0204579_0204892 things that you know they might want to buy the thing they think you can't get
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205457_0205662 That isn't a cover to fit it, am I right?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0205906_0205983 M
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0208960_0209296 I think it was just the production.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0210855_0211119 I think in the agreement that they were given it was very specific.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211119_0211269 I think we've done what we're required to do.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211269_0211781 and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at those kind of things.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0211781_0212244 I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0212398_0213152 We've done very well to get within Butcher and they still make such an innovative item. Yeah. I think people are really good at what?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213477_0213648 Good work!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213648_0213692 Maybe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0213692_0214036 Alright, do you have a set deal?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0219792_0219958 Siento.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0220084_0220492 I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221077_0221151 I'm really...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_FEE016_0221151_0221379 But do we not sometimes evaluate these meetings?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009137_0009262 Is that for us?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0009949_0010093 Yeah, shall I show you?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010093_0010200 マッシュアイ
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010200_0010830 Oh, do you want to hold it? Do you want to hold it? Do you want to hold it? Yeah. I'll say the presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0010830_0010982 Can I just make? Yes, yes, you can.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0011655_0011774 That was very crazy of it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0012076_0012140 Aki !
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0013863_0014453 Okay, so this is our look and feel presentations on our final presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0014453_0015093 and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015277_0015894 It's gonna have a plastic body with a sort of standard color like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0015894_0016555 whether we're thinking something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0016555_0017582 This is underneath the rubberised outer casing, which there'd be a wide choice they would be attached.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017582_0017838 But we can come up with it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0017838_0018731 the wide choice of colours and patterns. So you've got a lot of customisation with it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0018731_0020259 It's obviously a sort of clamshell design. The top LCD screen you can see there would be sort of
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020371_0020670 The black and white touchscreen? Yeah, yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0020670_0021549 it would be sort of inset into the top and the bands at the bottom would just so fully close flat.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021549_0021771 Yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0021771_0022666 and working on the inside with already said decided on the kinetic batteries which actually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0022666_0023422 thinking about it now because you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get it in top.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0023993_0024362 We decided that the voice recognition system
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024362_0024997 did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get hold of.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0024997_0025272 So we presume that they'd also be quite cheap.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025272_0025780 So you have something like where you chat at, where is the remote and...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0025911_0026127 It was shout back. I'm here for something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026345_0026723 I'm saying yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026723_0026955 It wouldn't shout out on here or something.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0026955_0027532 It was just a chat, I didn't know. Also, I'm actually similar. I like the two guys.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0027532_0028157 Yeah, I hope it was getting back. Well, that could be something the next time. Maybe.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028157_0028476 You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0028476_0029174 And the standard transmission with the TV using all the standard chips that we talked about.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029174_0029767 It would have, obviously, because it's split over two different layers.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0029767_0030462 would need two separate PCBs that will be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0030462_0031657 And because obviously all TVs use this, the same infrared medium would just be using the same thing to transmit the data.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031657_0031836 and the infrared
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0031988_0032552 the sender would be on one of the bottom legs.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0032552_0032972 just at the front of the... we haven't done anything yet.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033080_0033210 Yeah, yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033420_0033651 Yeah, on your front, on your front side, that, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0033990_0034391 So when you've actually got an egg then it would be fascinating.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034391_0034801 And then finally, the interspace.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0034801_0035814 The top screen as we said would be an inset black and white LCD touch screen which would
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0035930_0037058 have all of the available functions for the remote on it, whereas the bottom screen would just contain the stand buttons.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0037058_0038061 like the volume up and down, channel up and down, you know how I run it off. And things to that perfect.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0038061_0039089 And now, we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some kind of some bezel.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0039240_0039783 logo on it or something in set or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040004_0040229 No, it's not an item.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040229_0040867 No, not interfering with the whole look of the product when it's not on the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0040867_0041709 And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics. Thank you very much. That's the company logo.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0042881_0043105 Came up.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0060100_0060169 Yeah, I said it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0063870_0064567 Yeah, I've probably put it... Two... Yeah, two or three.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0064567_0064642 Night 3.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066278_0066375 I'm afraid
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0066839_0066952 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0068639_0068737 I'm gonna one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0069005_0069175 No, no, not at all.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080119_0080264 Yeah. It's nice.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0080340_0081046 No, the base colour was white or light blue.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0081046_0082045 But the changeable facias would allow you to get any basically any one of the number of colours that you can form something that's on there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082154_0082482 Bien, bien, bien, à très-mâche.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0082589_0083208 No, no, that's the spongy feel would be in the runner, the butt rounded.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083208_0083491 that otherwise it's just sort of half plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0083801_0083950 Yeah, I'm a little bit of a monster.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0087592_0087662 minimize this
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0090559_0090965 Yeah, I'd go for a five at some point.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0093454_0093931 Yeah, it was a voice recognition.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0094276_0094535 Yeah, yeah, that's... Yeah, that's... Excuse me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095126_0095345 Um, I think dude...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0095602_0096244 I think it would probably be a... A standard. A standard. It would be a standard. It would be quite loud. It would be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0096244_0096449 So please... And if you did...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097153_0097308 Yeah
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0097680_0098250 I do realise that now people are unfairly biased with it isn't it?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0102290_0102604 Like they are like...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0114834_0115187 with regular check-in on print rounds.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0115809_0115964 Oh no, no, no, no, the yarn.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116133_0116678 Yeah, it's... you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells that should just be one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0116802_0117113 In the top, it's the number. Oh right, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0117466_0117955 So would there be two? Just one rake.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118064_0118366 Yeah, one of them had one sample sensor and sample speed.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0118818_0118949 No to już jest.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119293_0119443 too, because it's lovely to love you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0119850_0120257 Yeah I'd say, I'd say it's... It just feels flat bottomed with one curl, top with three dors. Yeah, I think it's...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120464_0120574 One double curl.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0120693_0121171 And one, no, because one, yeah, one's double-curved.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0121776_0121846 わっす
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0122318_0122413 Maybe a bit of a blank on it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0125714_0125931 No, no, that's... It's including it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0126045_0126679 So that shouldn't be actually on there because that's not incorporated in the customer remote.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0128633_0128764 Yeah, okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0130421_0130825 Yeah, the push buttons, one and LC display one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0131134_0131227 Best
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0138203_0138312 Let's go!
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139752_0139857 Come on girl
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0139938_0140207 Maybe you've got to click off the can case.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0140518_0141065 It's a mine text, dude. You might be assuming that that is in Euros.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141065_0141279 as it could be in dollars.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0141279_0141927 And then we'd be fine because the exchange rate wouldn't get better. We haven't been dealing with dollars though.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0143648_0144016 Yeah, the standard, we would make one difference.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144016_0144324 The biggest one would be taking away if you took away.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0144543_0144579 It is.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145099_0145444 If you take away the voice, I don't know what to say.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0145444_0145718 And if you take away the voice recognition then you've got it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146347_0146418 the end
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146418_0146869 Where is the voice recognition? It's Samfu's speech
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0146869_0147206 Right, okay. Trickway that, that'll make it 12.3 phone.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0147540_0148015 That's minus three. Yeah, but you minus three plus two.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150154_0150760 But they aren't. I mean, I don't see why we have to serve 25 years now.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0150760_0151132 because they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0152684_0152856 But we need to work to that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0153005_0153128 Yeah, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154713_0154772 Yeah, I-
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0154997_0155203 We had our breakfast.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0156794_0157060 down there
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157060_0157389 Tüm bir yavrum, bir kılsız var.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0157389_0157688 Was it 12.5? Two-fifth. Was it 12.5? Two-fifth.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0163776_0164224 Because that was just a bolt on x-ray you could just take it out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0164377_0164535 und wie schon ein...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0165505_0165598 とらすでに
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0169504_0169624 I'd say it's a T
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0170117_0170307 find out about the future.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173464_0173955 Yeah, now I thought it went really well and I... yeah...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0173955_0174893 I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0174893_0175366 Though we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0175366_0176275 I think it would have made it into the final product if it was action. If we had seen the marketing before, the initial specification was put out.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0176275_0176799 I think maybe it would have come out a little different.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0179518_0179601 自汗
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182025_0182333 I guess the grass would be hard for...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0182963_0183503 Yeah, I think we probably would have used the actual email system more happily actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0183706_0184183 had had more time and if we'd been separated more
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0193972_0194451 I don't think the companies are really concerned.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194451_0194929 They're just like, we've got a DVD player. Does anyone remember the rowing control?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0194929_0195222 Can't you get the one that we used for the last one?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195222_0195447 Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195447_0195953 They don't really think about it because normally the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0195953_0196277 They're trying to ship the DVDs like video, but then when it...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0209117_0209327 I think that was just the physical.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0210588_0211064 I think but you're saying that that's quite well. I think in the remodeling we're given this very
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0212327_0212444 Yeah, it was...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213821_0213994 That's my second weakness.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0213994_0214279 It is a conspiracy going on, hey?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0214279_0214376 Yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0216025_0216367 Hi, I'm the Rural Arts Project Supervisor.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0218350_0218423 Nie zadaj, ja.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0220460_0220881 Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your life?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221156_0221346 but do we not sometimes evaluate and lose me?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221346_0221542 Yeah, that's... yeah.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEE014_0221542_0221919 I think question seven was the one I did just before moving.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002299_0002344 Thank you.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0002906_0002963 Okay.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0009468_0009897 Me and William worked on a prototype and I think William is going to make a presentry fan.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010362_0010480 I can hold it like...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0010605_0010822 I'll show you the presentation.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0011596_0011657 Thanks.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0012565_0012623 Ha ha
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0013210_0013453 Oh, where are the hinges?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0015304_0015388 It's gonna have a...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0020479_0020798 the black and white touchscreen. Yeah, yeah, it would be so ins...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0027429_0027532 はないびちか
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033228_0033450 If I could be a superstar.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033450_0033533 the front view
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0033648_0034164 Oh right, yeah, okay. So whenever you cut, when it's open here, the second one is open. So when you actually cut it, it's never be.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0035666_0035739 I'm not sure if I'm making it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0039896_0039971 but not into
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0040482_0040557 うんうんうん
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0042426_0042675 Все здесь вставано.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0044834_0045037 I think this is not a good shape.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055079_0055182 I'm scared.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0055336_0055621 Is it everybody's going to evaluate or is it just the...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0060095_0060228 Yeah, we'll see you there.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0065308_0065495 How's your full form?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066323_0066378 I'm straight
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0066756_0066816 तिक्ये
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0069892_0070123 What does it say?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070123_0070298 The first one reading I'm sorry.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070298_0070429 Can you just make it two?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070543_0070603 You're first.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070603_0070757 Yeah, I just thought he did it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0070898_0070995 E-eh-eh.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0071117_0071242 Yeah, I just got...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072069_0072130 拜拜
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0072878_0073085 Ein riesiges Gefühl, das ist alles.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080695_0080800 with one goal.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0080800_0080861 Bye bye.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0082600_0082771 No, no, that's it. That's it.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0083007_0083114 In the wrong.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0093601_0093754 Возьми, качай.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0107878_0108004 I'm a middle-on, but that's...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0109655_0109698 はい
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0115001_0115080 to the print.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119093_0119208 sing one double cat
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0119371_0119432 Still be loathier.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120299_0120367 than just one.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0120773_0120865 Because one of the
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122178_0122445 Just tickle one and maybe a bit of a fine cover.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0122756_0123099 I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put 0.5.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123349_0123443 Yeah, cause they're all...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123549_0123800 I think I love the pump sound here.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0123800_0123894 You can use that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124252_0124459 Yes, we are not using a lot of rubble actually.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124459_0124535 It would be like...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0124679_0124956 A very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0130211_0130272 Push button.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137174_0137358 I think you could change the battery also.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0137358_0137594 That's how we're going to use a standard battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139161_0139263 and curve that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0139789_0139960 That's not calculating.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141567_0141760 We haven't been given
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0141989_0142114 I think it's in your room.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0143373_0143511 We'll do it again
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144422_0144689 What I feel is customers never said anything about the battery, no?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144689_0144939 It's going to turn on, nobody looks into the battery.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0144939_0145209 But she ain't got the same thing as me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0145866_0146022 with that special form.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0146133_0146305 Do we see what difference it made?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0151558_0151753 In a recognition because
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157223_0157350 या वेख्र तो जबच्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्च्�
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0157501_0157589 till 5.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0158800_0158933 請說翻譯
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160150_0160473 I don't know but it's 50% is the cost.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0160473_0160647 The popular one was...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0161295_0161388 I think that is a plus for me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0162472_0162610 I'm gonna be hard on the door, sir.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165317_0165375 Seems like
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0165580_0165807 Excerpt from the mission with me.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0169703_0169821 I think you're gonna hate
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171331_0171714 I think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0171714_0172027 It's not like people trying to cut each other.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172027_0172218 It is more of a cohesive teamwork.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172218_0172557 We came to a very pretty creative design.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172672_0172761 I don't know.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172892_0172964 Yeah, I think.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0172964_0173137 Then sir you coordinate to develop very well.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0179596_0179920 I think that was the best part of the film.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185416_0185717 ஏன் பிடிக்கு லைக்கு விருந்து வந்துவிடும்
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0185717_0186263 I think it's good like we spend times individually
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0189474_0189743 Anyone thought of a ring-mount control with a flip top?
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191020_0191204 That's mine.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0191664_0191739 Yes.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192004_0192079 我看就開始
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0192175_0192251 It's a good.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0199681_0200613 Surprisingly, people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones. Like every month you see a new launch or something like that.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0200613_0201118 And new television products coming up, but nobody giving much idea to this.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0201118_0201302 This is the thing.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0210559_0210707 Maybe if he was gonna...
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0213665_0213719 If the octopus
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0215140_0215234 This is a fine foot.
AMI_ES2004d_SDM_MEO015_0216751_0216948 Celebration you didn't talk about.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005586_0005769 Are you ready? I think so.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0005769_0006085 I think the first thing you do is introduce ourselves.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006200_0006547 and with name and what your function is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0006547_0006729 Só, maybe, está aqui, viu?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0008798_0008859 And your name is?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010788_0010851 Very good.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0010851_0011071 And as you know, I'm Betsy.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011071_0011307 I'm the Project Manager for today.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0011307_0011817 So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012134_0012611 Opening, Quentons, Tool Training, Waves.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0012611_0013238 The tools, I think we already, I guess the tool is really the computer as far as I can see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013287_0013804 Each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0013804_0014097 project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014097_0014616 I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0014944_0015168 Here is what this thing should be.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015168_0015754 The same year, the design is a new remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0015754_0016232 So people are original, trendy and of course he's a fan.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0016519_0016699 to make some notes of that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019638_0019744 All right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0019744_0020164 here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0020378_0021157 That is, it's going to be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what we have come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021157_0021820 The same goes for the conceptual design. There will be individual work and then discussion afterwards.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0021944_0022212 detail design. Same thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0024394_0024545 I can try this.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025468_0025736 아, 땅!
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0025736_0025774 Night.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026002_0026470 Then two training, triads, a whiteboard, but still control the favorite animal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026470_0026872 Does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0026872_0027252 so that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027468_0027612 You want to go high lean and...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0027758_0027986 without hanging yourself.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0028810_0029082 And remember you have to press so it works.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0030752_0031064 Oh, that's a fat cat.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032052_0032258 and you're frantic, right?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0032258_0032750 Would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033022_0033083 Do do.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033083_0033153 No na co ke?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0033357_0033549 I didn't get to that level.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0036725_0037272 It's a project finance which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037272_0037593 Selling price is supposed to be 25 euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0037725_0038609 Profit aim for the company is 50 million euro. The market range unlimited meaning international.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0038740_0039364 and production costs should not exceed, hopefully should be less than 12-15 euro.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0040381_0041267 So these are all things of course to remember with the budget and when you design to materials, cost etc.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0041916_0042758 Now, the discussion I guess is, does any of you have experience with remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0042895_0043324 We use them, right? Every day.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043324_0043499 and um
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0043656_0044399 Now, having used the remote control for years, does anybody already have an idea of things you didn't like with it?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0044399_0044923 Things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing, any first ideas.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0045037_0046058 Do you like it to be smaller, bigger? Yeah. Have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons, you know, things like that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0046515_0046621 12 right
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0048672_0049526 So it should be a multifunctional gadget that will control all your household machines basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051311_0051812 It should be something new. It should do something different than just what we have.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0051812_0052107 Now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052422_0052829 Like, trendy, you know, like, earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0052829_0053345 Maybe in different colors or materials or you know
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0053345_0053873 So yeah, shapes, right? You know, like kidney shaped, first, there in your hands or something, you know?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055123_0055827 That is true. They put the newspaper or they put it behind the plant or you know whatever.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0055827_0056564 And suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the TV off and say, what the hell is my remote control?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0056614_0057317 Or if it's really in a dark spot, that it keeps out a sound or a signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057471_0057593 The floss.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0057674_0058145 If lost signal, throw signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058567_0058790 Exactement, c'est juste...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0058790_0059260 I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beam or light or something
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060567_0060957 Okay, my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0060957_0061646 In other words, if it's like in a dark spot, meaning you know, the newspaper is on top.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0061646_0062032 sweater is on top or it's behind the plant.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062032_0062575 At that moment it's like what you call it, the light sensors.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0062575_0063003 In that moment it has a sensor. It gets a certain darkness.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063003_0063476 It has a sensor and it gives out a signal. Whether that be a light signal or a beep.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0063476_0063721 I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064129_0064224 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0064224_0065078 You have to have some kind of sensor. I think voice or clapping is not specific enough.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0065078_0065848 I know they are the lamps and stuff, you can clap on and off, but I think they only work to a certain degree.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066408_0066480 What?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0066770_0067159 Oh yeah, will. But then those can be done. We can't help everybody.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0067808_0068395 We have to move along. Yeah, we have to move along. But I think we have some good points to start with here.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068584_0068849 Okay, the next beating will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0068849_0069212 I think you all... Did you get the notices on your computer for this?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069212_0069545 Okay, so we'll use that to notice.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0069545_0070163 the working design I guess that's the function ID who is this
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070163_0070398 industrial designer. That's you.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0070746_0071113 So we're looking for a working design when we come back.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0071572_0072011 and then the technical function, you are the technical function, so you are the working design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072011_0072439 So you have a working design and then a functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0072439_0073430 And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in general.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073430_0073594 That would be your idea.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073594_0073824 And of course price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0073824_0074169 They did. They did. That the price is a good price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074169_0074465 I mean the price is given but that was...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074633_0074679 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0074944_0075008 That's right.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075138_0075610 and you will get specific instructions for that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0075610_0075784 I think that's the end of the show.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0076472_0077087 So we have a time to three minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077087_0077357 Any questions at this point?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077357_0077595 or suggestions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0077780_0078716 I think basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions, I guess you can...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0079796_0080194 Then we see you in about 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIE088_0080194_0080361 and see what we can come up with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009185_0009269 I'm Janabi.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0009269_0010740 My role as an industrial designer and my responsibilities are to deal with the technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0042869_0043119 Yeah, we use them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0048170_0048273 temperature inside
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0049278_0049524 Machines basically.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0051779_0051874 Now of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0052783_0053265 Maybe in different colors or materials also.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0053809_0053924 of saying you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0057201_0057472 or a signal or something like that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058148_0058588 Maybe it should have a light so that we can just recognize where it is.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058588_0058634 clear.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0058700_0058795 いいね!
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0059086_0059303 Before light or something.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0063430_0063763 I mean that we can discuss that later, you know.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066398_0066528 What we didn't
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0066611_0066715 Because you're silly because...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0068207_0068311 Good point, das ist ...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0069165_0069233 before this.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0070461_0070773 Yeah, it's functioning, yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071171_0071568 Working design, yeah, it's a meaningful functional design.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0071725_0071875 clinical functions.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079125_0079260 Dawać ci, piłko.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079260_0079395 Yeah, I have a good idea.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO084_0079652_0079781 I will see.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006739_0006909 My name is Francaina.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0006909_0007661 and I'm a user interface. My role is the main responsibility is user interface.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0007661_0008083 and my role is to design a television remote control.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032223_0032416 Yes, I'm pressing it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0032416_0032508 I ja myślę.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033158_0033336 네, 잘생겨요.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0033747_0033963 Te vejo!
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0034799_0034978 Like we're in the grocery.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0035586_0035895 I was like, ah, okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0045394_0045442 I
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046146_0046571 Yes, I feel that all the remote should be very compact. Small.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046571_0046979 Those which we get here nowadays it's very long.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0046979_0047276 and it should have multi-purpose.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047276_0047914 like the remote control which we use for TV, it should be used for some other purpose also.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0047914_0048673 like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating system.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0048848_0048946 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052105_0052326 Yeah, design should be different.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052326_0052544 Almost all the...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0052790_0052882 ¡Espera!
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0053067_0053246 material also are
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057312_0057325 you
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057704_0057778 Cheers!
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0057858_0058016 signal
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0063866_0063918 and so on.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO087_0066540_0066638 because
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0005725_0005770 I think so.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0006154_0006257 Yeah, that's a good thing.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008339_0008533 And I'm a marketing person.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008533_0008694 I want to figure out how to sell them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0008882_0008969 My name is Eileen.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022046_0022155 Sensei
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0022276_0022645 different types of design that we're going to be concerned with.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0023611_0023838 액션, 섹션
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024101_0024250 Mmm.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0024812_0025104 Maybe we should redesign it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0025279_0025469 After we finish the remote control, we'll get to that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027623_0027852 Okay, I'll see what I can do. Whether you're...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0027852_0027889 to
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0028008_0028551 See if I remember how to draw kitty cat or a rabbit or something.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029006_0029219 I'll go back to work.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0029219_0029775 Um... out... Um... to get involved...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0030798_0031573 That's a fact. I'm very happy.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0031573_0031812 And it like sit like that. Okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0032877_0033282 Am I supposed to wear a scarf? No, no. No, that's okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035732_0035806 Ah, okay.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0035999_0036482 I hope the kitty cat is hungry because I don't like snakes.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0039523_0039851 Can it keep everybody on their toes and challenged?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0040286_0040648 So these are all things of course
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0049614_0050276 Well, that's 12.50 euros per.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050378_0050675 Well, I don't know, so we get a really good sign. I mean, we can do that.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0050780_0051357 We certainly can try to agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0051736_0051776 This has
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0053853_0054232 Friendly shape. Yeah, that would help
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0054232_0055025 I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap. Because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0055025_0055113 and they can't find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0056602_0056712 well or yeah or
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0057264_0057676 This isn't right. So it should either be floss or light should blink.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0058039_0058091 ¡Os sé que no!
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0059225_0060571 I do think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or respond to your voice or it would respond... What should you have to do to make it beep or bling?
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0062554_0062623 in that
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0063909_0064125 So the light sensor would activate the signal.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0065819_0066177 But it could be some place really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066522_0066689 No, because you're silly.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066689_0066793 Because people are so...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0066866_0067777 And those can be on... We can't help by every book. Well, if we're like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0067777_0067999 You know, maybe we have to move along.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0074525_0074986 We have to justify that by having sufficient features to make itself that price.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0078758_0079163 Okay, I think I have enough to think about to our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079163_0079283 About two people.
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0079650_0079774 Alright, well, that's...
AMI_IS1009a_SDM_FIO089_0080380_0080453 Okay, we're good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0003732_0003865 Ok, salut, vous êtes prêts ?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0004717_0005869 I take it you all have received instructions as to what we were supposed to do. Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0006079_0006733 I think the marketing manager probably should call first, addressing the needs and desires.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0007843_0007903 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0009559_0009705 e a participem de falso.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010096_0010373 kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon kon
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0010629_0010753 Uh oh, okay.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034130_0034686 one other appliance or maybe a lamp. Can I at this point interject something?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0034686_0035355 We have received instructions from higher up that certain things should not be considered.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0035355_0036262 The one thing, for example, something to eliminate, maybe that's the teletext because that's outdated. Okay. The internet.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0036262_0037062 And according to higher management, it should only control the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0037062_0038107 Mostly because they feel that it's too complex a task to include other things and they're concerned with the time to market.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0038285_0039112 And the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039112_0039508 and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0039508_0040221 so that it's easy, that we easily identify as a product of the company.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040221_0040704 and that there is no mistake, but it could be somebody else who is bringing this up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0040704_0041353 So I just wanted to check this here so we're not getting too much off track here with the things we want to look at.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041353_0041995 These were instructions from higher ups so we have to eliminate these things. Only going to be TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0041995_0042510 But the one thing maybe that could be an innate satellite text idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0042638_0042729 Alright.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056303_0056460 and are
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0056599_0057157 Who would be next? I guess that would be you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0057229_0057449 You want me to get your smile, Josh?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058082_0058319 and you are number three, number two.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0058319_0058366 Now it's
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060454_0060526 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0060798_0060871 응?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0071692_0072250 That's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0083585_0084194 Well, it's possible. Yeah, well, that's been it. So that's a pretty good point.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0085700_0085744 네
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086748 It just built that room basically, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0086928_0087468 There's a budget we're looking at if you build one wall that's gonna make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088357_0088405 Οι άστοποι!
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0088531_0089146 I hope with the marketing. We'll have to look at the budget on that but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089146_0089183 Because we
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089549_0089661 Silly. Silly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0089733_0089875 I recommend our nation.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096671_0096935 A little elderly, a little arthritic hand, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0096935_0097875 And it's a small button and they don't press it exactly, you know something else happens Not their favorite channel comes up with something else and they're very frustrated
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0100099_0100191 I'll get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102284_0102486 Because the clock would be really fast.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0102808_0103154 Yeah, I love you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0108556_0108634 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0111613_0111738 shoulder.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0115161_0115274 Oh, you don't have to.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0117944_0117979 This one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0119741_0119918 and unpack.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120040_0120160 You are... Yes too.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0120306_0120341 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0121071_0121245 What do you want?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0127901_0128111 On the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0128111_0128168 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0130485_0130598 for a certain age.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0149375_0149515 فائمر گیا
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0150288_0150602 Okay, now...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0153384_0154275 On my slideshow, basically we have already done the agenda and on the closing, basically there will be lunch break and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0154275_0155070 However, the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155070_0155734 and what function, working design, how does it work?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0155734_0156064 So these are the two things we should come up with.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0156064_0156654 So, the first thing is maybe a little easier on who is our target group.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157093_0157263 I guess in many ways everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157448_0157621 everybody who has a team meeting.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0157798_0158314 Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158314_0158496 There are few but in general not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0158673_0159520 Now, talking about the target group, which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0159520_0160519 We have earlier, it was mentioned about elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160519_0160975 So I think that's one group that's certainly important.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0160975_0161845 Then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0161845_0162455 And I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0162455_0163223 I mean that's a question whether that's important that children can really use it or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163447_0163714 So these are just some thoughts I have on it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0163714_0165367 and I don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're going to design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we're talking about different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0165367_0166225 whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0167876_0168847 a lot of marketing pull. That has a lot of appeal but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0168847_0169322 I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0169322_0170178 You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent banana color or whatever. You know. We make a banana shaped one. Yeah, for example, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170178_0170467 But the question is really who is our target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170623_0170867 Do we look at one target group?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0170984_0172090 And with the 25 euros, you know, can we can we afford to have I'm asking the technical people here whether to look at
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0172297_0172966 sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group. How much would then throw us?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0173074_0173490 out of the cost we are supposed to respect.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0175538_0175628 with
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0176298_0176399 Well that's family.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0179785_0180380 The question to be addressed here is only who is a target group and how will it function?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0180380_0181272 And I think the how will it function is probably the question of sub-tons, you know, within the target group or sub-groups.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0181272_0182218 The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182218_0182431 I mean the basic design they understand will be the same.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0182431_0183428 But the question is how much will that set us back if let's say 40% we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons. For example.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0183533_0184353 So that remains to be seen, but Tarja Group as a whole is basically everybody with a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0185553_0185747 Yeah, well that's the question.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0186847_0187426 Well, maybe there's an idea. You know, the new, for example, new portable phones.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187426_0187816 They have like removable plastic cases.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0187816_0188477 So you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0188477_0190040 In each package you have, for example, you have, let's say, a fluorescent blue on it, but then you have another color or a stripe or whatever that already comes in the package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190040_0190371 And then if people really want more colors, they can buy separately.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190507_0190650 mobile phones with you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190927_0190982 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0190982_0191694 But like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped whatever they have as another one in the package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0191694_0192696 and they can go to the store for a few francs or euros, whatever, they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it, for example.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0194549_0196111 Well, I think the idea here is to design one remote and the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0196111_0197066 having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197287_0197556 I've been a sucker, I guess that's the old message.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197828_0197944 We're done.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0197944_0198241 Um...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0198892_0199452 But I think if we do some more research for you. I think to sum it up, the target group is basically everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0199452_0200023 If money permits, we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200145_0200247 I'm going to be 70.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0200474_0201028 Do we agree on that in principle? Like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201207_0201447 So now I understand it's lunch break.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201548_0201631 And um
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0201778_0201922 So that's what we're going to do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202220_0202324 So thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIE088_0202439_0202690 And we'll see you after lunch.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0011039_0011117 for free.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0026483_0026554 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0037439_0037582 to
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057119_0057188 Um
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057335_0057454 Evet, evet.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0057454_0057498 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0058247_0058379 नम्ब तु नमचु
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059092_0059158 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059376_0059594 Kein Gitarf ist ein Tuss.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0059841_0060125 No, that's your car, part of it. They have to...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060245_0060521 Przypijaj
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060521_0060592 털 털
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060771_0060994 Yeah, exactly.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0060994_0061373 I am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061373_0061644 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0061832_0062592 The method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0062592_0063941 It takes the power from a battery, say a battery, it can't be an electric supply. Like you have to like switch, connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0063941_0066293 it should be a battery because remote control should be like you should take it to wherever you want and then this integrated circuit it takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infrared bits and it sends it to the device
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066293_0066601 like a TV or air conditioner something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0066643_0067027 A remote controller is specifically designed to a single device.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0067027_0068629 If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency. Like the remote controller it sends some bits, some waves like with a particular frequency. The device should know what the frequency is.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0068629_0070147 it should recognize the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote controller will send a signal.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070147_0070757 and the TV it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0070757_0071600 change the volume control and so I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0071851_0071905 Management.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0072628_0073653 So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the message is like there should be a user user interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073653_0073867 So you can control whatever you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0073867_0076040 You want to change the channel, you want to control the volume, you want to mute the TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations. There should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can send the signals and TV can perform the actions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076111_0076315 So you can go to the next slide.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0076382_0077721 I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller. I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much of the investment also.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0077721_0079412 It's like the text out buttons which are there on the remote controller. Those we can make like fluorescent. They'll be like emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0079506_0081211 and there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that this is not a you know action
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081211_0081515 there can be no action taken to that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081515_0081690 and there should be a child lock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0081690_0083182 like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like if you have kids and all that they'll be playing with remote controller so you can lock the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0083182_0084080 If make it usable for more than one device, it's hard but it's possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084080_0084245 Yeah, good point, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0084245_0085364 and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and um so that's good
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0085488_0085806 Bu da çok havalı
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086009_0086577 No, no, no, I don't think it will be like you can have you know for if you want it just build that to be basic
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086627_0086683 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0086683_0086926 It's just as cheap so it doesn't matter.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088300_0088570 Yeah that is also possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0088713_0088792 Yeah, that aboutcha don't...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089120_0089205 E...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089635_0089884 for children like an answer
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0089884_0090028 That's fun.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090210_0090371 That's sweet.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0090440_0091106 and the buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091106_0091392 If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091392_0091748 If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0091748_0092561 So I think we need to make some buttons which are like intended for two or three operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0092561_0093299 like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press the other button in another mode it will change the color
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0093299_0093901 So if you want to have less burdens we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0094196_0094311 English user
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0095879_0096045 It's like you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0096256_0096337 time
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0097647_0097780 being else and they're very
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0098176_0098450 You don't feel the mood, say?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099002_0099208 Yeah, shapes are also different.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0099208_0099290 a triangle
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100079_0100646 But we'll get to that with you. Yeah, and also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguities. That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100706_0100788 That's a good part.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0100893_0102201 and display clock if you want more features then we can display a clock it I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit yeah that's a
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102313_0102440 Because the clock could be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0102753_0103119 You can see when you're coming here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0103811_0104056 Can you go do the next one?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104056_0104880 The main components may need for it have buttons and underneath that there should be switch.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0104880_0105030 and bulbs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105030_0105851 Like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on suppose.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0105851_0106265 then the remote controller should automatically have a live
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106384_0106796 then it will be like if you switch on your TV through another source.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0106796_0107456 not through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller. Maybe you can find with the light.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107456_0107578 Maybe we can have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0107578_0107880 Whenever the TV is on, remote controller will have a light.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108020_0108277 and then in flurid bugs.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108277_0108576 This is like a when it is dark
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0108668_0109143 and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109143_0109521 which is like a brain to the controller which does all the operations.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0109521_0110074 and vice connecting all chips which is lights every time so there should be wires
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110167_0110652 And of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things in.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0110652_0111183 you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0111509_0111579 Je suis là.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112017_0112192 from Arganin and Genska.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112286_0112464 Next time slowly please.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0112611_0113850 I have referred the website, the home page of the website from where I got few points.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0114021_0114147 That's it. That's it from me now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115275_0115370 It's not like that
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0115370_0116172 I have referred the page to get new ideas of what can be the working design to how it works in the office.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116450_0116514 if you want.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0116568_0116646 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0117636_0117926 It's actually there on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137491_0137642 I wód się
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0137642_0137890 If there is a crop and it can be a crop.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0149124_0149678 later and use it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0157482_0157685 Yeah, who has a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0158170_0158348 don't have a TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0175767_0176417 We can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0176666_0176809 and a bit less budget.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177578_0177728 Yeah, of course, that we can do
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0177728_0179020 But specifically if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a big remote controller. So maybe specifically you can design a remote controller for elderly and for children.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179020_0179123 What about the electronics?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179295_0179446 It doesn't come out so fast.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0179728_0179872 That's the question.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186614_0186661 There's the...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186661_0186947 I don't think no. Well, maybe they...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0186947_0187015 There's an idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0190462_0191133 I like mobile phones, we have different covers.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0194588_0194668 I think
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198668_0198931 Yeah, I made it here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0198931_0199144 I think we do some more research.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200029_0200753 Do we agree on that principle?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0200825_0200991 We will be able to do that on
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO084_0202280_0202326 Bucky!
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0026925_0026998 Somebody take
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0027570_0027685 C'est un saison
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0071586_0071643 That's perfect.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0085727_0085777 가능한..
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0086714_0086806 No. Just us.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0089813_0089969 I said don't run.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0097699_0097754 and they're
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0102334_0102375 Because
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111068_0111184 Merci beaucoup.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111410_0111519 Please hold him.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0111519_0111649 and hold it, remove it all.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0119903_0119972 I've spent two.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0120208_0120273 No, no, I'm three.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121036_0121146 You can look at your foot.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121146_0121371 Yes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0121442_0122422 As a user interface designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122422_0122697 Can you please go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0122697_0123822 So I found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far-off distance, at remote distance.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0123988_0124081 Now for that...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0124081_0125332 A remote controller should have a switch on or off button by which a user can set anywhere in the room in front of the TV and it can control the different functionalities of the TV.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0125332_0126793 There should be a signal, something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television. If the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume, he can change it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0126978_0127965 Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user choice.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128388_0128951 So if you want to view a particular program at say 9 o'clock, he can set the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0128951_0129389 and the TV will automatically switch on at that particular time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0129389_0130658 So he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular certain age.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0130658_0131316 then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0131316_0132153 And one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0132383_0133347 The remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV, television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0133347_0134209 and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T in alphabet for more compactability.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134353_0134816 and there is one more point which I noted it down.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0134816_0135989 like the material which is used for remote should be human friendly, it should not cause any skin disease or some kind of allergy to either children or to an adult person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0135989_0137124 and it can have an alarm clock. A person if somebody wants to get it but around 8pm and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137124_0137523 And I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0137830_0138232 Yes and as Janvi said the buttons can be
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0138232_0139184 We can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons. So different buttons will glow differently.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139184_0139773 So even in the dark, they use a can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0139914_0140886 and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with the remote
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0140886_0141138 He should not be harmed in any way.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0141528_0142412 and find things. I found out different sites that there are different remotes which can be used.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0142412_0143443 There are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities. There are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0143608_0144513 So you have different types of remotes with different light source which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of the television.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145325_0145407 Listen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0145632_0146151 These are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multi-purpose use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0146201_0147193 No, like it can be used as a TV control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing and it should have a child lock.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147193_0147988 And then to save electricity there should not be much more lots of circuits and all that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0147988_0148961 and if a person, if parents wants the television to be switched off by 10 o'clock then it should be switched off at 10 o'clock automatically.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0148961_0149228 so that nobody else comes later and uses it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0149547_0149771 Yeah, and then you can use a timer as well.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0150148_0150198 you
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0157657_0157792 TV television views.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0169295_0169374 You know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0173696_0175737 Generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from 10 to 40 and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people with who have nervous problems.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0176300_0177029 But in a family, there will be an aged person, children and a middle aged. But they cannot buy 3 different remotes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0177029_0177625 They would like to buy just one and just one which can be used by all the three.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0179221_0179323 As much as I need.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0192775_0194536 But I have a doubt like will it be cause twice effective if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0195575_0195659 Okay
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO087_0199939_0200079 Within that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0003972_0004279 I just put on my microphone here and it'll be alright with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007539_0007703 Okay, who are we to start right now?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0007998_0008644 Could you put my slides up because I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009682_0009830 I'm still a copy of the four I've only...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0009830_0009886 Guess.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010847_0010963 Yeah, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0010963_0011958 Okay, well, I think we've introduced ourselves so the functional requirements is part of my goal, but when I'm going to pass right to the second slide.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012069_0012334 That's where my discussion starts.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0012334_0013030 Alright, well, since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013030_0013619 I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0013619_0014672 And the reason I just put that there like that is that in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0014672_0015069 You can say anything you want in my house, silly attempt. You know, it should run your car.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0015069_0016531 it should heat up your motor, it should turn on your seat heater, whatever you like to do. And then as we go on, what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0016562_0017633 So I'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's going to be to add a feature or how expensive it's going to be or if you're time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0017633_0018011 It takes five years to develop this. It's just something we can't do.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018011_0018921 So in the beginning, you just have a big puddle of things that anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0018921_0019778 And then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer will try to then prioritize those.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0019778_0020047 So that was what I meant there.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020047_0020887 And as I said on the slide there, consulting the industrial engineer about that. And the other thing is time is really going to be as important as money.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0020887_0021322 because if we're going to sell this thing, I think the best time to sell this is Christmas present.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021364_0021801 25 euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0021801_0022222 We want somebody to see it and think it's... dude, I just gotta have that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022222_0022406 and take out their wallet and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022406_0022828 So it's going to be really attractive, but it's got to go to market by September.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0022828_0023485 because anything that you don't have already out there in September, showing it around, isn't going to sell for Christmas.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0023485_0026102 And then I'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color. And I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026131_0026563 that we're coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0026563_0027101 and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet, you know.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027101_0027851 What's going to really be what they call a sizzle? Because we've got to sell the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0027851_0029054 A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just going to take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029054_0029206 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0029486_0030625 I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the whole house idea really isn't going to be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0030625_0031175 So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we could suggest anything.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031175_0031708 I'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0031708_0032924 not something like, you know, whole house control. And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0032924_0033501 At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the TV, the VCR.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0033501_0034381 the stereo set, maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034381_0034459 I had to wind up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0034568_0034638 something
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038132_0038212 Of course.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0038308_0038440 Bye bye, so good to see you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0041820_0041895 Aonjikadu
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042700_0042838 Alright, thanks for that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0042838_0043738 Um, alright now, other things that I found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0043738_0044093 It's a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044093_0044900 And that was 34% and even more important, the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost some line of room.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0044900_0045388 So those are two things that we definitely do want to address.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0045388_0046099 We want to make it as simple as possible, we want to make it obvious and intuitive to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0046099_0047160 And then the things about finding it, we talked about the later-mitting thing as well as maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047160_0047734 And I think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047734_0047873 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0047965_0048737 Okay, so my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0048737_0049169 That is the selling point, the thing that's going to make it an impulse purchase.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049169_0049802 Because once there's no be back in sales, they always say, you know, be backs don't come back.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0049802_0050107 If somebody says, oh, I'll come back and get it next week, you're dead.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050107_0050250 They're never gonna come back and buy it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0050250_0050983 You've got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now, now, now. Now is a big word in my book for selling this thing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051054_0051832 And in order to make it really saleable, we've got to shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0051832_0052603 We have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion. So that's why I'm saying simplicity is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052603_0052895 Finding it's important obviously. You can't use it if you can't find it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0052895_0053566 So, we've got to concentrate on the features that help you find it. And I've already said this several times, but I put it down and writing here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053566_0053911 There should be an attractive impulse purchase at 25 Euros.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0053911_0054476 So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it, they say, uh, 25 euros, I'm not going to take that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054476_0054921 has to be so great that they're gonna say, ah, 25 euros isn't much.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0054921_0055696 And then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0055696_0055895 Okay, that's about it from me right now.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0071650_0072292 Yeah, that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0075399_0075459 The integrated...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0083710_0083926 That has been it. That has been it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085300_0085700 That's good for a marketing point of view, it will be a fun shape.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085700_0085982 You said that won't add too much to the budget.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0085982_0086172 No, no, no, I don't think it's...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0087557_0088267 Do you think there's any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088416_0088504 I'm not gonna mess.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0088504_0088682 Because I helped with the marketing.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0089144_0090328 Because we had something sort of sexy for adults, we could have something sort of silly for children, like a little elephant so they can remember where it is.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0093904_0094930 I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss with the user interface person because I think there's a lot of argument remade for one button for one feature.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0094930_0095705 So I think one of the things people were complaining about when I found out my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0095705_0096316 The changing modes with something... It's like you and I. I mean you and I, all four of us, we work with computers all the time.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096316_0096672 changing modes is nothing for us, but people who
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0096845_0096954 You know
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0097752_0098520 It's a kind of thing people learn by feel. You don't feel the mode change.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0098520_0099118 So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be helpful. Yeah, shapes also differ.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0099118_0100076 You know, like a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100076_0100251 But we'll get to that with you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100587_0100676 That's right, yeah.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0100676_0100766 Now that's a good one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0102143_0102905 Yeah, that's a good one. Because the clock could be really friendly. And one is your favorite show coming up.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103084_0103293 Yeah, and a lot of times it's not a clock on the screen.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103293_0103559 and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0103559_0103774 Yeah that's good, the coke is good.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0114715_0115075 So we should visit this site and have a look at whatsapp here.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116205_0116375 So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0116540_0116634 Okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0117284_0117607 Could you go back to that salon machine that does the side up bets and
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0118011_0118110 Yeah, okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0135833_0135885 但这
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0137802_0138030 Yes, and as John we see
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166276_0166737 Well, you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0166737_0168094 So if you design something that's very attractive to children, the mommy please mommy please, you know, we want it now we want to go to the store and see it. That has a lot of marketing pull.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169274_0169314 That's right.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0169762_0169980 I would make a bit of a shoot one.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179007_0179132 What about the electronics?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179132_0179323 that's not really going to change as much as it
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179406_0179688 That won't change much will it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0179808_0179911 To jest...
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0184362_0185216 That's right. And can we? Is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185216_0185658 Or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0185658_0186120 It's the same electronics and basically all that's going to be different is the plastic case.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186120_0186575 And in that case we could probably molded plastic isn't all that expensive is it?
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0186575_0186754 Here's an industrial person.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0188725_0188880 There's a real idea.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0191056_0191112 İstediğiniz için teşekkürler.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0192228_0192322 an alternate package.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0194615_0194841 I think the idea here is to do this.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0197756_0197905 We're gonna finish with that.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0198506_0198918 Well, we may have to come back to our next meeting.
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0200114_0200201 Can't wait to-
AMI_IS1009b_SDM_FIO089_0201029_0201159 Okay, it's...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004216_0004299 Hello everyone!
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004479_0004718 How are we doing?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0004927_0005625 First we're going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0005625_0006870 In the last meeting, the marketing manager had presented her method of working, meaning gathering suggestions
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0006997_0007904 from everyone to see how she best could market this product within the budget that was given.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008138_0008820 In general, the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0008975_0009457 It's also an item that people lose a lot.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009457_0009814 So, we should address that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0009814_0010097 And of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010196_0010416 That is very simple to use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0010556_0011343 In addition to that, to make it sell, of course, the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011343_0011676 or like she says, put some sizzle into it in one way or another.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0011777_0012321 so that the people are buying it now because in particular with smaller items
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0012321_0013004 That's a very important fact. Because if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013079_0013750 Also mentioned was it should have a very short learning curve.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0013868_0014315 and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0014486_0015156 Our technical manager has then said that he feels it should have a chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0015303_0016034 that has infrared bits and it has an interface controls the chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016141_0016636 Therefore messages will be controlled in the same manner.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0016636_0017055 There should be extra features like lid buttons, maybe a beep.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017055_0017265 If too many buttons are pressed
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0017385_0018387 child lock and maybe display clock so that people could
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018493_0018818 You could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0018818_0019144 Also mentioned was maybe different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0019338_0020355 So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infrared bulbs, battery, chips, wires, and maybe some kind of a holder.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0020468_0020854 for the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0021026_0022213 Franchino, who is our interface designer, has mentioned that the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0022213_0022856 of course you would have an on off button and also I have mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023009_0023561 particularly if it's maybe small children that they couldn't watch a channel that is undesirable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023561_0023683 It should be compact.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0023683_0024093 Her personal favorite was it should be T-shaped.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024093_0024326 and maybe having a long clock.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0024326_0024794 and the material should possibly be of non-allergic nature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025022_0025699 The different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0025804_0026480 maybe it should have electricity saving feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0026583_0027722 and even possibly a timer so that people can program their favorite program right from the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0027908_0028452 Are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Yes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0028659_0029094 Okay, then we I'm looking for three presentations
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0029094_0029975 And I don't know whether the order matters much. I don't think so. So whoever wants it. Like it's that. Yeah, okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0030610_0030733 Okay, please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0031419_0031552 Boom. That's all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0032145_0032361 And that's number two, right?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037338_0037392 9 or 10
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037392_0037633 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037796_0037911 9 channel switches
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0037911_0037995 Jest.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071148_0071367 Okay, thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0071367_0071681 Any comments on her presentation?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074229_0074411 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0074936_0075179 No, I think these are representations.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0075179_0076320 But as far as the decision making, we're getting back to that. But if I just wanted to know whether anybody had anything to add to her...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076418_0076442 Bye.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0076735_0076947 Who wants to go next?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077090_0077226 Okay, and you want this one?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0077711_0077778 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0078760_0078872 the compounds design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0098452_0098489 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130408_0130522 You have more pictures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0130522_0130739 We have five minutes to the end of the video.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134033_0134113 Okay, well thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0134248_0134577 Any particular comments by anybody?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0137498_0138269 We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her. Okay, we'll write my first
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0138383_0138486 Okay.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0151820_0152029 uh that
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152200_0152485 concludes the presentation of everyone.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0152485_0153203 And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0153362_0154015 And so what do we think on the concept?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0154112_0154194 Off to remote.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0156370_0156455 I think that could be our...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0158654_0158929 Well, you teach, you have to teach.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0161998_0162607 Okay, before we get too far off here, the components of the concept is the energy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0162607_0162897 What kind of energy do we foresee?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0163699_0163926 Okay, then chip on print.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164176_0164267 그리고 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회적 사회
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0164267_0164756 And I think we all agree on the case we want to have something maybe bright, colorful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0165479_0165739 Denny design compact and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166028_0166645 user interface concept interface type supplements
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0166960_0167250 I will be your area, I think.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0167951_0168227 Ja myślę, że to jest już w tym momencie
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0168722_0168921 I'm not sure what the advice supplements...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169317_0169382 I was like...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169701_0169802 I might be tricking you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0169802_0169923 Right, right, right.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171259_0171654 Our next meeting will be in 30 minutes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0171654_0172685 And the idea is to... this is the individual actions to be taken until then. To have to look and feel design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0172871_0173724 and the UID is supposed to come up with the user interface design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0173847_0174301 and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0174301_0175288 In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Frantin, have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay. It says here.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175288_0175809 You will receive specific instructions, will be sent to you by your coaches.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0175954_0177111 If you have any questions, you know, you can always contact me or your coach, I suppose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0177327_0178398 So I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in 30 minutes according to our time.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIE088_0178752_0178832 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0004829_0004877 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0040287_0040407 그는.. 에이..
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077014_0077070 Hmm?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077209_0077282 Discipline.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0077830_0078010 the next one serves.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0078010_0078122 It's just the old one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0079698_0080715 This time I am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0080715_0080945 Can you come over to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081013_0081722 I have just briefed down few components which we require for the remote control construction.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0081722_0082429 The first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit, battery, etc.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082452_0082974 It can be a hard plastic one so that it can be strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0082974_0083549 even if you just you know if you if it falls down then it doesn't break.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083549_0083753 So it should be strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0083753_0084199 and there are no harmful materials used in that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084199_0084349 and it should be recyclable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0084523_0085230 and also using of coloring compounds like if we want to have different colors
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085230_0085823 blue, red, green so we have to use some colouring components.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0085884_0086444 and the second important thing is integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0086444_0087057 We can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087057_0087957 If it is not efficient then everything is going to be less efficient. So we should have a highly sophisticated one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0087957_0088348 and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088348_0088688 Suppose FF is 38 degrees outside, 40 degrees outside.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0088688_0089579 It should be able to resist the temperature, high temperature and low temperature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0089579_0090048 and it should be equipped with a timer and alarm facility.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0090140_0092106 And the other component we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a I think it's like a battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092199_0092360 Can you go to the next slide please?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0092605_0093019 a diode, a transistor, a resonator
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093019_0093692 These are all the technical electronic components which we have to use in a remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0093692_0094109 Battery I would like to suggest one thing if we
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0094162_0095016 If we will be able to make a rechargeable battery then we need not go for a high performance battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095016_0095434 Even if it is a low performance battery, it can't charge much.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095434_0095628 it's not a high voltage battery.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0095628_0096094 then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096094_0096748 So in that way we can cut the cost but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable once
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0096832_0097215 and we have a circuit board in a remote control room.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097215_0097446 and go to the next slide please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097446_0097754 and how it works, how the remote controller works.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0097754_0097852 When you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098639_0098714 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098714_0098982 when you press a button, when you do that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0098982_0099792 You complete a specific connection. That means when you press a button there will be a small circuit underneath the button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0099792_0100604 and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0100604_0101397 Suppose you have pressed channel 1 button, number 1 you have pressed. Then the chip will know that the number 1 button was pressed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101397_0101770 It produces more score line signals specific to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0101828_0102181 Every button, every individual button has its own more scope.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0102181_0103151 Suppose the user has pressed button 1, then the circuit will generate a specific Morse code to that button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103151_0103896 and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the LED, which translates the signal into infrared light.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0103896_0104247 Like you have got a signal by pressing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104247_0104633 that Mohr's Court has been generated by the integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0104690_0105088 Now that signal that mosquit has to be amplified by the transistor
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105088_0105449 that is the use of transistor which we use in the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0105449_0106205 It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the LED and which translates the signal into an infrared bits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106205_0106914 The sensor in the TV can see the infrared light and seeing the signal, it reacts appropriately.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0106914_0107871 that when it sees the amplified Morse code signal then it will know what action it has to do.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0107871_0108100 then it will do the appropriate action.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108100_0108406 So this is how the remote controller works.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108608_0108739 and we'll go to the next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108818_0108950 Yeah, I have few pictures.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0108950_0109602 when you look at the remote controller, this is a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109602_0109775 and then explain it please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0109916_0110176 and we had a few buttons and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110176_0110781 And if you open the remote controller you have this circuit board and few electronic components.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0110781_0111206 Like you can see a chip there which is having 18 pins.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0111206_0112252 and also a capacitor, three resistors and also resonator and the diode transistor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0112409_0113165 All of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and diode, transistor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0113411_0114156 Yeah, you can see the TA-11835 labelled chip.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114274_0114940 You can also see the two green things are resistors.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0114940_0115695 and just beside that you can see a transistor and a cylinder shape that one is a capacitor.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0115695_0116236 And also there are resistors, sorry, there is a diode.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116236_0116386 Can you go on to dance?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116498_0116663 So this is the circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116663_0116861 The green one is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0116861_0117506 Actually building a circuit board is pretty easy and also it's inexpensive.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117506_0117850 It costs less than what you print on a paper.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0117850_0118489 Because when you are building some circuits and also wires,
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0118489_0119311 It's better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a bulk and it's just printing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119311_0119607 Nothing like you know you don't need to use wires and all
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119607_0119842 It's not exactly wires we are using.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0119842_0120132 It's just printing something on a board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120132_0120531 those prints will act as wires and circuits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120671_0120979 So that green thing is a circuit board.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0120979_0121709 and also you can see there are like access for buttons like when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0121709_0122749 The circuit under the button will be activated. It will get some signals from it and it will send the signals to the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122749_0122929 integrated circuit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0122929_0123067 ごちそうさまでした
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123124_0123528 So these are the circuits underneath the buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123528_0123781 Can you see the black round mask?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123781_0123904 They are the circuits.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0123998_0124113 exposed.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0124113_0125076 and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0125076_0126004 But a push button requires a simple chip underneath it but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126004_0126666 Like for school rules we have to go for a sophisticated and full complete shape.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0126666_0127306 And as energy source we offer a basic battery, more engineers, a hard dynamo.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127306_0127968 a kinetic provision of energy. Modern watch is that you shake casually to provide energy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0127968_0128534 So that also we can have in a battery or we can use solar cells.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0128993_0129358 The product can be delivered into different cases.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0129358_0130124 Usually the case is uncut flat that we see usually a normal remote controller.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0130672_0131029 Yeah, I have just one more slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131214_0131805 Like we can have materials such as plastic rubble wood titanium but titanium we can't use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0131805_0132583 And also for electronics we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the print.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132583_0132975 also in flow it includes infrared sender
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0132975_0133592 And for the movie just to develop a sample sensor speaker.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133716_0133830 ...jabcy.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0133922_0134042 So phone now and call
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135352_0135967 No, no, no, the scrolling was different. You can go for switches like buttons or scrolls.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0135967_0136326 which we used to do before, ten years before I think.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136326_0136783 Now nobody uses it because you need a sophisticated chip and all.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0136783_0137172 So I think it's better we go for an ordinary button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0137172_0137325 Yeah, he was with us.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0155951_0155980 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0156682_0157287 I agree with that. But I am very much doubtful how far it will work.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157287_0157809 Because speech recognizer has a small... Distance problem?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0157856_0158196 Yeah, it's not distance problem, it's recognizing a person's voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158196_0158744 like maybe different people will be having different voices so it will be like everything.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0158875_0159324 So I get a good recognizing system.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0160727_0160814 Damn it, I've used it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0164914_0165021 I'm back
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0165087_0165205 Friendly, disinstructions
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167428_0167885 like the switches like we use buttons for user interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0167992_0168050 Późnę z razu.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0169896_0169937 To był
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO084_0178831_0178919 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0021374_0021488 Interface to me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0029733_0029926 whoever likes it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0030545_0030674 No, my...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0032580_0032667 That's been 3.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0033756_0034196 As an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034196_0034711 how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0034904_0035003 next.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035170_0035689 Now the function of remote is to send messages to the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0035689_0036777 This message could be a switch on off message, a switch to next channel message, a swapping the channels, a switching on to a particular channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0036777_0037125 Like you can have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 up to 9.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037733_0037769 Pardon me?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0037914_0038091 Yes, 9 numbers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0038297_0039313 and then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0039580_0040685 Then you should have a next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0040685_0040793 Next slide please.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041040_0041593 Then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0041810_0042459 Then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on at elevation.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0042459_0043076 For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have subtitles in English.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0043076_0043969 then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044193_0044767 Then there should be some buttons which can control features like the color.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0044767_0045303 Color of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0045677_0045873 Now there should be a memory switch.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046272_0046472 There should be a mute button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0046472_0047301 Suddenly if a viewer gets a telephone call and if he doesn't want to switch off the TV
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0047301_0048236 But he can reduce the sound. He can bring the volume down and he can watch. While talking he can watch the TV.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0048236_0048884 Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049045_0049572 It's an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0049852_0050709 So remote can be designed which can have the voice recognizer. You can record your own voice.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051039_0051517 which can be recognized by a voice recognizer in the television.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0051517_0052189 If you want to see the ninth channel, if you say just say ninth channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052189_0052811 The remote will automatically switch to the ninth channel.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0052811_0053586 So the TV will have some recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0053586_0053930 So this is one of the very important features a remote control can have.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054117_0054527 So this is one of the interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0054720_0055229 a very simple interface which has all the important features.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055337_0055442 Please next side.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0055573_0056263 These are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056263_0056861 Sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0056861_0057360 So you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057360_0057596 Even a kid can use that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057596_0057810 So can you go on to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0057900_0058505 So this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0058505_0059282 And this has multi-purpose use. It can be used for TV, it can be used for cable satellites, it can be used for VCR DVDs and audio.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0059519_0059766 and this has inbuilt voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060165_0060335 Again, you're going to do the next line.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0060335_0061014 Yeah, now this is an interface for a child, for a remote which a child can use.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061014_0061664 This is use-friendly. It's very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0061664_0062022 And this comes with different colors, different shapes.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0062692_0063723 and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0063815_0064076 Attractive Child Interface
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064655_0064779 It's like this.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0064779_0065694 Now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace in its own way.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066114_0066729 This is a very big, you can have best plays at any time.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0066729_0067250 So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to misplace or lose.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067389_0067648 So this is one such interface which can be created.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0067837_0068986 And the personal preference would be to incorporate speech recognizers which will respond to user's voice for a particular function.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0069197_0069294 Thank you. That's it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0072873_0072896 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0075564_0075593 Be carefull.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0108382_0108416 you
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0113958_0114005 Uh
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0137241_0137310 We're in the
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0154766_0155184 Yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0155994_0156254 This could be a one feature which could be sellable.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159121_0159844 No, it's like you're recording a question already.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0159844_0160229 And then you are expecting an answer from, for example, you have a TV system.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160229_0160992 I am the user and my family members are the user. I will already record a question like...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0160992_0161438 Good morning like around 8 o'clock I want to see the news in the television
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161438_0161756 So I'll say just good morning and the TV will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0161756_0162029 It will recognize my voice and it will switch on.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0164881_0164970 from the past.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0165119_0165290 This is a strong compact
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0167885_0167954 C'est quoi ce patin ?
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0168978_0169657 It's a different type of features buttons. You can have mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO087_0178837_0178885 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0028468_0028599 개가...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065632_0065748 You don't know me.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0065748_0066286 I could lose that in a minute.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072037_0072494 Well, looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072494_0072892 What? I'm no suggestions bad.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0072892_0073178 but we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0073178_0074006 I don't think that we can get the T-Shapers good, the Child One is good, it's a too big to miss place, I think it's just funny.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074006_0074814 I don't think that's going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0074814_0075047 It's gonna be a little bit... No, I think it's really big.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075159_0075207 D'accord, merci.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0075476_0075617 and have to come back to that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0076254_0076643 No, I think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0084611_0084654 Good point.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0128530_0128654 Well, that's interesting.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0134648_0135275 On the scroll and the push button, you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0137109_0137442 We'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138188_0138348 We're right to my first and my next slide.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0138641_0139591 Alright, my method is I'm interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0139591_0140222 And so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140222_0140793 I spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0140793_0141346 And then when I'm out, in people's houses or meetings or anything like that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141346_0141886 I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it can be in the conversation I ask about it.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0141886_0142148 And I would encourage you all to do the same.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142148_0142685 And my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0142685_0143016 People like something that really fits in their hand.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143016_0143144 Simple is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143144_0143839 They don't want to have to squint at small print. They want buttons whose functions are obvious.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0143839_0144355 and they want as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144355_0144558 They want each button to do something.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144558_0144676 and eye catching is important.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144676_0144923 It's gotta look cute, it's gotta look appealing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0144923_0145145 Go ahead, I'm trying to finish fast for you.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145145_0145782 And our preferences as far as I'm concerned or we've got to get to the market before the competition
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0145782_0146250 ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146250_0146840 so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0146840_0147354 And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0147354_0148032 If we try to sell people that has too many great features, the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148032_0148872 So you've got to narrow our selection down to two things, I think, that we're going to say are really great about our new product.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0148872_0149481 And I've been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149481_0149939 And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0149939_0150324 And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150324_0150982 They're more back into soft feels, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0150982_0151470 So those are things we want to look at as far as the saleability of the item.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0154519_0154897 You want to try to come back to yours? Yes, I would like to...
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0155631_0155945 The speed recognition is most important as far as you're concerned.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156276_0156529 Yeah, that could be our star feature.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0156529_0156793 That might be really good. Yeah, I agree with that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0157714_0157817 distance problem
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163036_0163363 I think we all agreed on that.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0163363_0163659 That's going to be most cost effective and the best thing.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0164816_0165230 red, colorful, and also trendy, trendy, and strong.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0168945_0169070 So, we'll see you again.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169264_0169694 Yeah, like, or like her speech recognition, but also in your supplement.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0169694_0169928 I must be a true recognition. Bye.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0170012_0170726 Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible, pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
AMI_IS1009c_SDM_FIO089_0176912_0177406 Where were they hiding?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0003938_0004133 Well, hi everyone again.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0004324_0005440 Like before, I have to reduce the minutes from the last meeting. And so here we go.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0005591_0006464 It was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0006567_0007903 designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the TV
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0007903_0008979 It should have 9 channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, color contrast, sharpness etc.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009020_0009435 for different memories which mute button in case the telephone rings or something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0009435_0010653 Speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to see to be integrated in this new remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0011091_0012013 Should be a child friendly design with few buttons, colorful maybe with star shaped or other shaped buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0012013_0012926 She presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013217_0013332 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0013485_0014410 But her very personal favorite really, she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0014410_0015315 The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0015315_0016438 She would like a special paste made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials. Should be recyclable and should be colorful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0016564_0017116 should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0017284_0018010 She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated in
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0018010_0019144 Technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode, transistor, resonator and if possible rechargeable battery.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019263_0019471 and of course the circuit board
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019599_0019852 and how it would work. You press the button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0019852_0022001 The chip is a more code related, relays to the generator amplification. And the circuit board is very inexpensive to build. And so she thinks this is a great feature to consider.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022216_0022696 She would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0022804_0023264 Scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0023384_0023891 should be battery operated and of course should have the special cases.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0024040_0025146 The marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0025146_0026273 has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0026431_0026654 Easy to use and it should be eye catching.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0027036_0027745 From her point of view, of course, one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0028058_0029057 To do that, maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on, or in other words, on which our campaign could be built on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029213_0029697 too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0029697_0030149 So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really given home.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030288_0030916 It should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0030916_0031126 She feels that's really what people want today.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0031293_0032097 The decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0032218_0033189 The energy should be battery, should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong and should have buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0033325_0033798 And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes, from the last meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0034072_0034535 Now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0042922_0043023 Mm-hmm
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0046331_0046436 நீட்டி
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052178_0052253 What night of button?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0052399_0052600 A menu? A one? One?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064279_0064480 Yes, the buttons are all raised, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0064566_0064651 race and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0065317_0065522 or two hands to over it up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0067081_0067808 Yes and it sort of sticks up so that you really don't have to go like, oh yeah, here in Thailand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0069570_0069806 So if you left-handed or right-handed...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072255_0072883 I have one question. Will there be anything written on the buttons?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0072883_0073380 like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0073933_0074457 We'll have simple so that the user really knows it doesn't have to be a good point.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0074976_0075613 But anyway, it has to have some kind of symbols text or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075772_0075805 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0075924_0076155 Okay, I just want to make sure that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0076927_0077000 Let's meet
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079005_0079329 Now what are our special features for the marketing?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0079329_0079718 That's really the voice recognition. That's really unusual.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0080276_0080937 And then any other thing would basically be shape or practicality of use.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0081109_0081159 Well
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084293_0084575 Okay, now having said that, I'm
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0084864_0085297 No, now this was our evaluation criteria, which we just have done.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0085297_0085576 Now we're going to talk about financing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086184_0086437 Ibu sam tamo.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086437_0086485 Thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086604_0086809 But that's after it's financing. Oh, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0086872_0086929 많이 시청해 주셔서 감사합니다!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087539_0087996 Okay, we had Lux and Voice Reclamation.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0087996_0088686 Okay now on the financing we bring up the... there it is.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0088686_0089440 Okay, energy source we say that's battery, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0089637_0089762 Okay, ciao.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090085_0090281 So I guess we use one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0090983_0091358 If you sell a chart, you're trying to change the pool 30.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091358_0091446 Oh, that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091530_0091813 I told him I could just change it to another language.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0091913_0091984 再說
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092731_0092979 Oh, okay, yeah, okay, let's see.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0092979_0093328 Okay, one, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093328_0093443 I'm going.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093443_0093918 kinetic source. So that's in the energy source, that's all we need.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0093918_0094226 electronic simple chip on print.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094226_0094356 Is that what we're using?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094356_0094432 one of those
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094559_0094685 Come on.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094685_0094872 Okay, one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0094872_0095121 regular chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0095286_0095859 That's all we need. One case. Uncurved flat, single-perved, double-curved.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096704_0096864 Double curved.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0096864_0096935 one of those
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097223_0097444 Case material supplements.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097444_0097645 Plastic Resent, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0097826_0097962 would rapper
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098268_0098462 ale tak, jest
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0098722_0099264 That's just for the case materials. Okay, the special color, so we having that right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0099509_0099901 and then we have the interface push buttons
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100368_0100500 Scroll will know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0100500_0100770 Interpreters going LC display
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101319_0101533 buttons up them in special color
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0101770_0101856 Special form.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0102276_0102552 and special material rubber wood.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103051_0103417 Total 7.6 whatever that means
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0103665_0103782 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104079_0104235 8.2
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104683_0104824 That's fine.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0104967_0105054 8.2, right?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105236_0105427 So we looks like we are
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0105564_0105656 Well within budget.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0106093_0106272 I should say this is a policy.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0107999_0108108 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108661_0108807 I just like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108807_0108969 Night of Kim's Cockroaches
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0108969_0109144 I'm a shoes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0109683_0109836 Okay, fine.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110140_0110431 Okay, good. So that's the good news.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0110431_0110834 You gotta be popular.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111164_0111424 So that I think financing was pretty simple.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0111535_0112165 Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0114600_0114759 You want to go to the next slide? Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131419_0131783 I just realized one thing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0131783_0132180 In the financing there was no room for our voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0132429_0133181 And I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that. Well...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0133554_0133711 8.8.20, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134116_0134616 I mean, maximum we have another 4.3 girls, I mean 430.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0134767_0135522 But we have no way of presenting that to management as a finished...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0135522_0136083 as a finished product and saying okay, we see a voice recognizer that costs so much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136202_0136654 So we just have to be aware of that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0136654_0137085 I mean, and know whether the 430 will really cover that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0139488_0140779 I'm sorry to interrupt that but I just remembered that there was no room for any special features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0140907_0141086 So we'll be there with that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141086_0141328 You want to go to the next slide?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141540_0141654 I don't know.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0141654_0141780 I think that was my last thought.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0144286_0144428 by any time.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0145622_0145736 I think you can make it there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0148505_0148664 Yes, I think shape is one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0149756_0149886 You give the fool.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150247_0150389 Um, hello.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0150516_0150699 I think I would give it at least a 2.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152596_0152725 Call right
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0152988_0153157 I like the colors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0154776_0154971 I think I will give it a 2
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0156922_0157788 Well, it's also you can't really try it out. The other things you have more is are more tangible. So from that point of view, but
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0158088_0158204 I'll give it a 3.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0163765_0164417 Here is what we are looking at satisfaction on for example room for creativity.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0164981_0165391 Is there a moment for creativity or are we absolutely happy?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0171858_0172740 Yeah, obviously bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still, you know, we probably can't
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0172740_0173341 With this particular item we probably can't just add a whole lot of more things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0173341_0174395 We need to live space money-wise for the voice recognizer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0174986_0175438 So the question really is how do we feel with the project process?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0175438_0176658 Are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0176806_0177143 I think personally I think I'm pretty happy.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177258_0177401 어
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0177613_0178216 And then the next question is, are we happy with the leadership of this project?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0178586_0179168 I think teamwork I think was very very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179398_0179899 And I think we are happy with the means we use.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0179899_0180315 We used whiteboard, we didn't use digital pens against all these things.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180745_0180864 Yes, we could.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0180927_0182201 It's maybe not in the best position in the room. Sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody. And I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0182303_0183135 because it was better positioned. Yes, I think so. I think absolutely. And fortunately we all had to slide the presentation which made it a little easier.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183135_0183441 Did we find new ideas?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183441_0183527 So I think we did.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0183727_0184471 I think we did in more than one respect and so I think we did very well here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184719_0184848 Are the costs within budget?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184848_0184947 Yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0184947_0185232 i su pročeg te evaluatiti.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0185367_0185861 Then celebration!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186464_0186776 So I thank you all very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0186776_0187153 I think this was very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187272_0187669 I think we did come up with a new product that's feasible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0187669_0188086 Visible from the production point of view and visible from a marketing point of view.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0188280_0188412 So, okay, thank you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0189421_0189660 I always get it on her, I'm updating it all.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIE088_0190479_0190598 Oh yeah, we have time.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035625_0035939 So this is what we have made
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0035939_0036376 This is a model of the remote controller which we are going to be.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0036376_0038147 This is in a snail shape so it is attractive and it is blue in color bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons so it is look wise it is beautiful.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038147_0038429 and also compact in shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0038429_0039128 and also it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039300_0039665 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0039828_0041301 The material which we are going to use for the case is plastic which is strong and also for the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0041445_0042426 The material is plastic and for the buttons it is a soft rubber and oh that's good. Yeah, that's a separate
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0042426_0042999 Yeah, because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043039_0043332 and then for the lead.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0043332_0044239 For the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0044413_0044878 and the button button spot will be explained by fast enough
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0062030_0062128 Till next time.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0073522_0073605 these buttons will
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0074614_0074775 going into an international market
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075161_0075253 I have to have some.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0075541_0076079 That we can have on the case itself. That's right. We printed on the case. Okay. I just want to make sure
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0077042_0077318 This nail shell, it goes right back into his shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0078699_0078921 or something like that, you know?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0094238_0094352 Is that what we're using?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0096277_0096347 This is a
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0098501_0098936 I think that is for the case material.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103508_0103763 I think that's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0103915_0104042 I want you to do that too.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0108986_0109101 I wish it's...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133675_0133765 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0133822_0134090 It was so about four year olds to go, just bad.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138186_0138315 that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0138953_0139031 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0140240_0140346 included.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0148666_0148936 Okay, so then, yeah, she is.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151175_0151364 Even I can get this one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0151364_0151441 It's like smooth.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0153266_0153342 甜 酸

AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0165682_0166106 Yes, include some more buttons and features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166106_0166342 we can make the buttons few buttons smaller.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0166342_0167206 I think they are quite big. So I think we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0167206_0167460 if we want to have more features in that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0168404_0168517 Yeah, that's neat.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0169338_0169663 Yeah, that's not having too many buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0177249_0177331 Uh...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0178437_0178646 네
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0180636_0180757 We're all of you.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0183540_0183677 Yeah, we need room.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0188433_0188521 なきュエレマンス
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0189656_0189882 I think it still has some time left.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190111_0190291 You have no idea.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO084_0190908_0190969 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0034881_0035112 Just look alike the button part eyelash.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0044970_0045542 Now we decided upon including certain features and are remote.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0045542_0046564 Now these features includes the signal emitting signal, it's the LED or LED, the infrared.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0046564_0046958 Now we have included the switch on and off button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0047312_0047703 Now we have included another feature that is the mute button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048112_0048363 and the side of the model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048363_0048767 Then we have included 1 to 9 buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0048890_0049190 for controlling the programs, the different channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0049751_0050264 We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0050738_0051294 And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0051690_0052136 Now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052259_0052337 Menu Beta
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052416_0052502 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052613_0052695 at the center
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0052836_0053649 We have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color, sharpness, brightness.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0053896_0054005 of this and a picture
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054300_0054709 We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0054854_0055307 Now this is a special feature which we have included.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055307_0055379 Now this button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0055525_0056591 is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible. So if it is turned towards the right, it will take to the previous channel
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0056591_0056916 If it is turned towards the right, it will take to the next jump.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057045_0057353 it will take the usage to the previous and the next channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0057662_0057755 Swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0058428_0059316 Swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the 10th channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059316_0059420 Dispendent. Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0059919_0060901 And at the end, this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and then it will act accordingly.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061477_0061773 So this is a proposed model.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0061773_0061987 Now the marketing expert has to...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0062120_0062796 give her suggestion when it will be sellable or it will be cost effective.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0063532_0063628 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0067684_0067788 All in, yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0068745_0069236 No these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons on both sides
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069236_0069323 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069916_0069948 Allez, on va le faire.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0069986_0070147 This is the menu, yes, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0070404_0071261 These two are to increase or decrease the volumes and these two are to scroll the program channels.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0071408_0071569 and slowly up the scroll down the channel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0073384_0074001 Yes, it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols will have symbols
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0074001_0074203 So that the user really
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076128_0076730 And one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076730_0076808 A shell shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0076928_0077026 Right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0077093_0077224 He goes right to the next one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0078678_0078822 There is nothing like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0096360_0096459 Simple, cool.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0098878_0098991 Oh, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0101930_0102129 Yes, we do have special points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0103669_0103947 That's the price.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0104663_0104891 Nice points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0108498_0108598 in the test.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0123878_0124032 That's what people are gonna do.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0138250_0138356 Bye, guys.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0140728_0140766 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0147847_0147931 You are soaking.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0155305_0155381 A plus !
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165536_0165724 It can be very simple.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0165869_0165978 is featured.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0171906_0172054 will obviously be bearing in mind that
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0178402_0178668 Yes, yes, definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0180493_0180786 a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0185498_0185849 celebration
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0188429_0188486 아, 귀여워.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO087_0190292_0190402 This is 40 minutes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0013037_0013522 She was challenged on that point. That's right. But...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0039502_0040024 You used to have all the buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0042228_0042451 Oh, that's good. Yeah, that's nice and friendly.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0046289_0046397 or NET.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0052441_0052514 Thank you very much.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053828_0053902 of the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0053902_0053969 this up
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058041_0058417 the next channel in a numeric pattern or
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0058778_0058833 Yeah.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0059376_0059485 Okay, yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0062821_0062982 Okay, well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063112_0063579 What I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb. Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0063579_0064261 But you can really hold it in one hand. You don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0064511_0065246 The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand, you can even reach it over here. Right. So you don't have to turn it around.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065246_0065653 Turn it upside down. Move it up and down. I really like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0065653_0066194 You really did a good job on that. My little designer.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066194_0066948 And I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0066948_0067118 That's a really good, good...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067220_0067346 So, yeah, screw it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0067786_0068008 The color is very attractive.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068008_0068633 These buttons around here are the mute
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0068759_0069052 These the front buttons which are here are the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069159_0069314 Und Balscheitz mit?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069314_0069519 So you can push either one? Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069703_0069948 And this brings the menu up on the screen.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0069948_0070393 This brings the medio on this one. And the orange ones are...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071210_0071387 channel it's so op in
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071387_0071489 पर लो लापस को लग
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0071589_0071843 It looks like something I can sell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0072104_0072410 Okay, now I'm supposed to... I have one question.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0074373_0074971 We need the symbols because we're going into an international market. We can't have anything that's language dependent.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075356_0075447 symbol
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0075447_0075544 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076158_0076217 more features.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0076855_0077167 For the snail. Right. We have the snail shell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077167_0077358 He goes right back into his cell.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0077358_0078888 Well, you know, I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail was known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0078888_0079032 That would really work.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0079632_0080257 I think voice recognition is our big selling point. Nobody else seems to have that in this press range.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0080981_0081579 Yeah. And well, I think that everybody's going to say their remote control is practical.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0081579_0082128 I think we have to dwell on the appearance.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082128_0082331 you're really gonna have the best thing.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082445_0082708 cutest remote control on the block.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0082708_0083555 So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image, play with the visual and then the voice recognition.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083555_0083713 And I think those are the two things to push.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083713_0083762 The luck
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0083897_0084011 and the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084011_0084185 they're gonna be our two selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0084556_0084761 I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0085663_0086259 Ah. But in my instructions, I think it's how I was supposed to go to the board and do something.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086517_0086566 Yeah, that's me.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086744_0086822 아오 오케이
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0086822_0087076 Sorry!
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0087076_0087088 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0089556_0089598 That's right.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0092477_0092677 Can you just feel it in the yellow boxes?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0096533_0096673 I guess it's still occur.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0097975_0098164 rubber because we're gonna have the soft buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0098936_0099082 Oh, okay, then special
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0100797_0101105 No. I mean, it didn't put the clock in it after all.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0112217_0112448 Okay, I'll take my file down so you can make it up.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0113791_0113889 Keşbüye bulgenim.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114272_0114502 Okay, why don't you move just to the next library away?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114688_0114846 Yeah, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0114846_0115717 Okay, well, obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question, will it sell?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0115717_0116800 And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0116800_0117268 We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117268_0117552 and show the prototype to consumer research groups.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0117552_0118356 Do not want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118356_0118628 So we have to get some input from those people.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0118628_0119064 And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119064_0119388 We think it's good. We're going to get behind it and sell it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119388_0119535 Next slide please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0119781_0120514 Okay, now the things that I was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120514_0120928 I wanted the shape to be biomorphic. I didn't want anything with angles on all squares.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0120928_0121283 I wanted to be comfy and roundy so we got that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121283_0121644 Size is small, the color is bright and warm which is what we wanted.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0121644_0122239 We want in the field to be as soft as possible. We'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122239_0122686 even though it's going to be hard plastic, it feels good in your hand, so that's nice.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0122686_0123207 and functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0123207_0124124 So, paradoxically, the other features, in other words, the look, the feel, and the shape, that's what people are going to get in the store.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124124_0124344 They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124378_0124658 So they'll be our main selling points.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0124658_0125417 So, those have been fulfilled by your prototype. Go ahead to the next slide please.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0125417_0126043 Okay, so the shape I think is a one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126043_0126301 that's really, really excellent shape.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0126301_0127341 The size is small and these points are the importance for the marketing. These aren't in how I feel.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127341_0127967 I think that it's, I think that it's plenty small enough to sell, but I think we're sort of right, the scale is one to seven.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0127967_0128408 I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128456_0128620 And our color I think is great.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128620_0128975 The colors are bright and warm and really do a great job there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0128975_0129552 And given the constraints that we had, I think we got it as soft as possible.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0129552_0130090 And then functionality, I think you did a really good job on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0130090_0131014 Obviously we could have added different functions but then we disturbed something else. So I would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0131014_0131379 So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133143_0133582 Well, we had what, 8 euros 20 as our cost?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0133730_0134107 And so we've got four URLs to go to spend.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0134602_0134830 Well, um, that's it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137150_0137939 Well as we know in today's technological world you can do just about anything at any price. The problem is quality.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0137939_0138351 So we're just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0138351_0139103 and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0139103_0139488 As we've seen with so many of these kind of products.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141252_0141534 Well, isn't this my last one?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141607_0141656 Bye.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0141656_0141844 I think that was my last thought.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142274_0142365 치
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142596_0142934 And I'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0142934_0143589 And we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now. So if you put my last slide back up there.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0143817_0144241 I'm sorry, yeah, to that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0144660_0144894 Well, because I can't remember where I put on the...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145310_0145611 I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145761_0145853 Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0145937_0146050 you
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146050_0146395 So, now we're all supposed to say what we think.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0146395_0146789 Um, okay, so, um, shite.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147227_0147341 I gave it one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147480_0147945 with what would you rather, one being good and seven being the worst.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0147945_0148244 What do you think the shape is?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148244_0148497 one okay that's it
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0148683_0149060 Okay. Yeah, she is. Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149060_0149273 And how about on size?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149676_0149785 Onside
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0149863_0150178 I have it at four. I feel it's just average.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0151479_0152066 Oh, here's the cycle. Of course you want to give me one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152066_0152323 And then how about how we're getting on color?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152668_0152819 I gave it one.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0152819_0153059 I really like all those nice bright warm-ups.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153405_0153617 One, one, okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0153617_0153839 and how about the finger?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0154126_0154680 taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155051_0155410 Okay, I can't even three, two, three. I'll give three.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155687_0155789 Tchumul?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0155919_0156691 And the next is functionality, where I admit I was a little hard on our team here, but...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0158686_0158775 Two? Okay.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159432_0159557 Well, um...
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0159803_0160156 It looks like we've gotten ourselves a pretty good product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0160156_0161362 Functionality is the only place where we have to think about maybe having a career and having another meeting.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0161362_0161910 But, um, otherwise I think we're ready to go with this product.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0162068_0162501 Does anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate?
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0167642_0168775 Well then again if we're going to do the speech recognition thing, we're going to be adding some buttons for that. So we're recording the speech.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0168775_0169598 So that's where we're going to have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons. Yeah, that's so having two mute buttons.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0169598_0170293 and then maybe we can do something with the
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170425_0170535 the volume control.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170535_0170789 we can put that all on one button.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0170918_0171804 and a couple of other, maybe, the salad, some of the usage and see what we can do with that.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0177170_0177576 I'm pretty happy with it. That's something I think I can market.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178213_0178697 I think you've done a good job. Yes, yeah. Definitely.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0178981_0179274 I think we were both together as a team.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0180322_0180811 Maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182205_0182421 Then we used the slide because it was better positioned.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0182537_0182670 I think actually, and
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0183545_0183798 Yeah, we're very good.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185190_0185260 Yes.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0185896_0186554 Today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them we have champagne.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0188646_0188930 Watch out, I have my cord behind it.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0190501_0191179 Yeah, we have time. But we don't have to. We were told we could end the final meeting at any time. Whenever we felt we were going to. Yeah, we didn't have to.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0191856_0192197 I'm taking the rest of my microphone out of the money.
AMI_IS1009d_SDM_FIO089_0192517_0192575 ¡Adiós!
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447 I'm just gonna draw cat twos home.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812 Just try something out.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060 Different than Garfield
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246 Mijn is een beetje meer skin. Ja, ja, skin.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971 Well, it's supposed to be a cat.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118 I like to be friends with them.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106407_0106456 there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0107490_0107525 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0109049_0109083 Enjoy.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0126778_0126843 Yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256 They were all mentioned.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673 You want it? I need it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955 See you over brand-jong places.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125 Are you ever sitting on the right place?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629 깨서
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003264_0003336 Tch.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809 I just don't introduce myself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274 Everybody knows me. I'm very afraid.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415 네
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801 the start of the presentation.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834 First I'll tell you a little bit about the sitting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037 You can see the field cameras here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797 They'll record more actions and you'll have wires in the microphone, they'll record your voice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416 I also saw some microphones there, but you don't have to pay attention on those.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014 Because it will spare you. You don't have to tend to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424 So this is our project document folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919 There are some notepads already, I see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145 I'll start with the presentation kickoff.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968 We will have the ministry.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206 Okay?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375 I'll figure it out.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227 Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for real reaction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529 It's a company in Trawings.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476 Het fashion en electronics make it work. We love effort and design. We do it by itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865 I'm Marty Boulton, Project Manager. So I'll direct you through the project.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177 This is our agenda.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771 We are open with great install training and music plan discussion closing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902 Maybe I can sit down and I can take some notes or... let's see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442 Maybe you can take the man's? That's the man. Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136 I don't know, it's not a long word, but just... if you hear something, you might not just read that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525 Als je kunt zien is het de opening, kijk even naar de stilte.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917 Ja, ik weet niet of dit een point heeft, dan een beetje.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314 Have you all seen the corporate website already? Yep.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701 Have you seen any flaws?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949 I think I found one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019352_0019396 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753 See you at the Bronx Station.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054 どうぞ、ご視聴ありがとうございました。
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335 ¿Qué? Nada probó.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274 But on the corporate information side there was real remote instead of real reaction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934 Real remote is not really the company we are but... I don't know.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335 What are we going to do?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735 Our project aim is as you can see a new remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113 as the original trendy and user friendly.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811 So these are the points we also hired you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629 We've got a marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214 industrial designer that's also used differently in the original
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776 And we've got our user interface design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206 That's about the new remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089 Our project met, there are three phases we're going through.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568 First, it's functional and I designed it in a virtual work meeting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992 after the virtual design, then the conceptual design, then the detailed design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683 I had some low indications from here.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177 But I think you know it already, by yourself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124 De industriele designer werkt op de werkgezondheid, componenten en een beetje van de beeldgezondheid.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102 De user interface designer gaat door de technische functie design, user interface concept en user interface design.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0031102_0032189 and the marketing expert was doing a little bit of user requirements specification, trend watching and project product evaluations.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473 That's a bit what you're going to do.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816 Maar dat wil we allemaal werken, dat is allemaal geweldig.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524 Then we've got our first tool training.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263 We're going to work with a lot of high tech tools here. So it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870 As you can see we've got the smartboards here and here and the whiteboards.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579 In the whiteboard here is an old toolbar on this side.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682 Here are some functions
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790 as you can see.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251 These functions we don't have anything to do with. Only undo you can undo a little.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563 A piece of drawing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897 that blankly documents for each person.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144 Select pen razor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423 Catch you later if there's to do anything with.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867 Then cut our pen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005 This way.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928 It's really funny, you can draw with it in this way. In this form.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305 Je kunt ook de color en de lijn met selectie kunnen selecteren.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673 With that first you have to select the PEM function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011 We're going to work with it in a minute.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261 Drink.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873 It's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings in there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081 Then
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513 A short thing about documents.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935 Lícada da Archer as Folder, project design, tudo.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279 Wordt je docking ons? Zullen we? Of niet?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895 But you will find that already because there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697 En deze zijn ook op de smartboards. Dus als je een documenten van een show hebt, kan je het openen van de volgende.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097 Here's the sample tool bar.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751 So they just say print move back or forward one page
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947 Ik ga zwijtje meteen in de deftelklaar.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479 And then we're going to try out the whiteboard.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119 So as you can see, we're going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785 Just to get a bit familiar with it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932 No, it's business running away.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351 Is everybody saying my thing with enough?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721 We're going to draw an animal.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367 and just some of his favorite characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213 The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607 So I can start from there.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177 You can use this pen by holding it like a little child.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801 Because if you hold it like this, sensors will get blocked and the... I can...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366 Another thing is you have to be a bit slow.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895 Felly, mae'n ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud i'r ddweud
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0051895_0052898 Choose for us. They're in color. I think gray is broken.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052898_0052990 Then the knife.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502 Okay, so I'm going to be nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863 Nanti kita lihat pembentangan saya. Okey, kita lihat ini.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193 Зажарим?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579 Ah, here you have to do the real stuff.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800 Ah, trying to build a doll. I hope you notice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204 So yeah, it was a bit of a sweat.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330 Here's the camera.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775 Now we've got another function.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063 Are you going to be raising?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197 and I can do
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576 this easily.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878 That's it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429 and I feel through right now a few of his characteristics.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469 Ik kan nu een tekst doen.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677 This is typically a Vue action, I think. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107 Maybe I should hold it a bit.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408 That's the same thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073 I think that's it because if you want to understand this then go looking here, strike.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319 I don't know. Just wait.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182 It's not mine.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320 Haydi.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929 Thank you so much. I'll see you in another one.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0068929_0068980 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319 This is where I've been.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319 Back right fist and correct the wrist to the button door.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477 This way, sir.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194 So I'm gonna hand over Ben and give like she to you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407 Tu as vu ?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838 Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126 Because this is going a lot better than I did.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669 It's real ducky.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081 Rekendische, ja, dat is het.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551 Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0084551_0084628 Just...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666 Yes, thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351 Yeah, yeah, I was kidding.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283 Is it your cat or did you find him on the street?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495 Tch.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818 So, everybody knows how to work the whiteboard now?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508 If you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the line, just ask and go ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679 Send that, please.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677 We've been haunted. Hunted by a ghost.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990 Ik ben bedoeld in de reduction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506 Move on to the Project Finance.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430 As you can see, for a remote control, the selling price is 25 euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648 Arshad and Bryce.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946 Ik heb het EMS gehad met 15 miljoen euro's.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775 That's the least we have to get from our remote controls. So we have to work together to reach our names.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717 We can do it international, so we have to focus on different kinds of users, different kinds of cultures and different kinds of trends as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143 But that's all in the later stadium.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933 De production cost is van 1,5 euro.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883 So that's also a point we have to keep in mind. We want to make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060 Go on, work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394 So just try to remember these points.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393 The selling price is 25,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770 And production costs maximum self and all euros.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275 So this leads us to our little description.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783 We've got about 5 or 10 minutes left for description.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140 So I'm gonna sit down and think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442 Is it?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622 I've got a message.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120622_0120698 Fuck this.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118 Okay, so that's a good time. So just on the side note.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952 Maybe you have to say the magic word. Say it. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208 진짜
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553 Maybe if they just clap it down.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0122828_0122914 Back up again?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568 selection
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123733_0123799 itself.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948 Nice, pretty big on that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102 O teu game?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649 Ah, esto es leptos.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0124998_0126251 But, so, everybody has experiences with remote controls. And I mean, not the ordinary remote controls, but also a little bit different ones.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555 Like you can give us four other. No really.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0127905_0127958 BOOM
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777 Yeah, I've got one at home.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653 You can program, I think, eight different devices in it. You can use it for your television, anything else.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326 and it also operates on infrared so you have to go to the little device inside your room
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868 And then you can operate it from the third earth, second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716 So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs and you've got a link to your TV on the second floor. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893 So that's a pretty handy...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460 Wir brauchen...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401 I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133401_0133481 シアルです
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757 The scripts are in number.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250 Yeah, that's nice. I think it's your job.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482 So we want different functions.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420 and we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720 But I don't know if it will exceed the production cost.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021 So this is something we have to find out, I think.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893 and other functions for remote control.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329 You can make it...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0137725_0137806 Approved?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500 So these are a few things you can think of.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030 I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040 So you can see the rest of this.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726 대신 알겠죠
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142726_0142792 alrighties
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0142928_0142988 com o carinho.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680 Any questions about this presentation?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793 Cake of presentation
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790 Okay, then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048 and then it can all work.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405 Finish meeting now.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955 How do you see me all the work on our own projects?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455 Okay, then I will meet you in about a long time, I think. Okay.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639 Merci pour les vidéos, à bientôt !
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0076704_0076747 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595 Just gonna drive it ahead.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0089790_0089839 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352 Go at it, then.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097503_0097536 Oh
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097650_0097761 I got you, man.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0097848_0097894 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0098652_0098803 그..
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099099_0099154 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539 Umm... Who's the ref?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802 OK
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126436_0126474 Ну, вы...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0126779_0126875 いやいや
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580 Okay, yeah
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751 No, the second floor.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137604_0137671 Sure.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110 What a move for me.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494 Eh, she never left. Now who were they? I mean, she never...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD011UID_0141037_0141123 Okay, how much?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004079_0004149 Marseille.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0004810_0004844 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353 Wegen?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0018307_0018353 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267 Cancer, I've been much attention to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0021216_0021268 Oh yeah.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0046928_0047006 That was interesting.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892 Well, thank you, not a short fiction.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0071206_0071246 That's all there is to it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584 Okay, not much more like this, but here you go.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833 This is my, uh...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320 that your dog there was and sprayed on their butts.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084648_0084705 Yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0084935_0084977 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049 They're really slow, actually, right?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144 They're really animals.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316 And that's just...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191 So pass the pad to our guest.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667 Garfield
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700 you
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0110215_0110298 big
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120296 There you go, that's it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414 So just on the side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0123611_0123667 It's all fair.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159 Pô, é boa já, mano.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0124708_0124779 Oh, there we are.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126746_0126820 Bull. Yes.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508 kind of brought TV at home and the DVD player so they got like a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030 One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442 And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0130808_0130852 I'm sorry.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967 So I think you can take me in again.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0134155_0134240 since Gerald
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478 But that would be really good if we could do that.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534 I think I should be shockproof.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045 My remote control tends to... Waterproof.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381 Yeah, one other little thing.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763 thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0140875_0140940 So you can see
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213 How much has left the middle battery?
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994 but they'll also really drag up the production costs so yeah we'll have to see about that too
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437 But maybe just a little, um...
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0144083_0144179 I hope you're excited.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0145529_0145582 I'm listening.
AMI_TS3003a_SDM_MTD012ME_0147202_0147250 Oh
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232 Well, I think if we're gonna use a touch screen, we're gonna go way above the 12.5 Euros.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266 But so the it wouldn't be very robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531 It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777 Okay, I've got a presentation about the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003 the first about how it works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099 It's really simple, of course.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285 everybody knows how to remove worms.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468 You should press the button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999 The remote determines what button it is. Use the infrared to send a signal to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301 the TV switches to the frequency or function it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811 So we've got the plate
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206 Dat is conductieve disc voor alle botten.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983 When the user presses the button, the signal gets set, goes to the lab and transmits it to the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340 It's a very simple device that you can use.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614 Dit is een schermetische overvuur.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802 We've got the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017 The power source.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468 And when a button gets pressed it goes to the chip.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059 The chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324 When you press button you can actually see your pressed button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094 Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441 Keep the inner working simple so it's robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841 I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301 because if you're going to use high tech materials price it's going to go sky high.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105 You only have to design a remote once and if you use high-tech materials it comes back in every product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046 So in my idea it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250 That's it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073 I think that if we put our marketing right, we can sell this just like... I don't know if you've heard about it in the news.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281 De The Elderly Mobile Phone.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249 If we make a remote control, with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872 We hebben geen focus op de design dan, maar op de functie.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940 We just...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346 We change our focus on the project. Anything.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636 We can sell this.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330 That's a good idea.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275 And besides that, if we're going to focus on elderly people, they'll have to adapt.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548 They're not used to using scroll buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860 Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426 It should be possible, yes. Good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604 Het is niet te fijn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913 and if the remote stays rather small, it should be better.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902 so we're just going to focus on the extras.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548 Like with your keychain if you have so many guys, it makes us...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974 I think we'll have to choose between the docking station and the screen cause.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187119_0187191 So that's it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094 I don't think they have different television sets.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344 in every country.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002 Everybody, fun space again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370 Cheers.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777 Okay, so this is our second meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100 and still fading.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726 Now we're going into the functional design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0007726_0009245 The important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719 so that we can move on to the second phase.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959 the first in space
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273 Doeis een announcement.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705 There is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288 There's our ghost mouse again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018 Dat betekent dat je een beetje sterk bent over de aardconditionering, omdat het een...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339 That's him, Wayne C&E.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853 So I chill out for a couple of days.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438 It's going to be cold anyway so I don't think...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584 Then our agenda.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747 That's where it's the opening.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911 This time I will take the minutes.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375 You're going to have a presentation?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502 All of you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365 We've got 40 minutes for the whole press-blog.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769 So I suggest we take about 7 minutes per presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354 And then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which I can send to me.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291 and then the decision on the control functions which we want to include.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511 I've got 40 minutes for all of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947 So I suggest that start with the first presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134 Who wants to be first?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337 Maybe it's easy if you... Yeah, I think you will tell me your presentation as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787 switch function you have and what are you gonna talk about?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054004_0054103 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516 So, anybody have any questions? I feel none.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829 And that's for sure the coins.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054829_0054905 Okay, that's clear.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160 Yeah, I did a second.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571 Yeah, you can take it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860 Bir katı...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0058229_0058319 Good.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638 Well, that's all.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610 Many ask questions about the technical functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654 That's it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727 네
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130 Maybe you can first listen to your presentation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669 And then we'll have a little discussion about the requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351 I think it's going to last a time.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0102358_0102401 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926 Okay, now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we're doing right now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724 I'm the project manager, so I'm going to mess things up and play some new requirements.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739 That's... we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0106739_0107827 That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096 So it has to be simple.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600 Another point is we have to skip the data text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0108600_0109601 Because in the world of upcoming internet we think Taylor Tech is going to be a thing of the past.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069 And it's a function we don't need to know remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739 Internet is also mentioned, just go, in a function you can use.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063 En ook op televisieën dat het een pijnboog is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672 Another one is the customer is 40 plus.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578 That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257 This is a bit paid for the marketing expert.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682 want hij was eindelijk de jonge persoon.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200 We moeten een markt vinden die is over 40 plus, waarin we de...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648 remodels control and the other way around.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449 and we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026 So it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572 and we have to be very clear on this point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721 l
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215 Let's have a discussion on the control functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0117632_0118925 New Crunch requirements? We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091 against the no-dial text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559 É, e faz um É, é faze de vermelhoso e dexidê
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107 Step. Pretty.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383 I think we cannot
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238 I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970 If we put a lot of effort in those, we can make remote control with just two or three buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577 or just a remote which is suitable for the market you want to reach because it is 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305 And if you look in Holland, the whole generation of 40 plus
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992 50 plus it's the biggest share of the whole population now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668 But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456 The people think that's the device I've looked for although I didn't realize it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604 So, let's try it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136353_0136447 It's a big success.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731 make a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367 We don't have to focus.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011 I simply think...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830 that the new products we're gonna make specifically design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726 We are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0140860_0141918 And I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419 That's what you told. Channel selection is important.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809 Volume Selection Power and Theta Text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055 Nee, we hebben het niet opgevallen. Ik denk dat het tekst...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587 Then the function as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776 but only if it won't...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134 higher the cost
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705 Because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well, but I don't think that will be a problem.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019 Where is the text?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751 So I suggest...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374 Is anybody really against ThetaTax?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956 This is the... that you just keep the title text.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477 Dit school is wel speciaal voor de subtitles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786 Maybe we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123 Make that...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725 Another point of advantage in our remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587 We make a button next for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173 Voor de ouderen die kunnen denken dat ik een subtitel zou willen, dan push de button en dan krijg je de grote subtitles.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064 So I think that attacks can be very useful in our advantage.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617 Functionality should be few buttons, you said.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239 I think that's very important. We have a few lessons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701 Dus het is gewoon simpel.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318 I think you need to wait
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219 You don't need it. Do you need the buttons for long to cheer up?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339 Mais bien sûr, c'est un truc à l'inclut.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911 Ne bileyim?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797 Maybe you can implement the scroll button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154 or joystick, like.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450 There are other ways to.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649 Just look, if you look at telephones.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168 The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0163536_0163590 Yes sir.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236 This is the numbers there.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076 We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display and if it's too much we can reconsider it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328 But I think that one leaf very much better.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493 or they're done.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813 The number of moments.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082 I think it's very important in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763 It can make a very fancy design by putting the buttons in the right places.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041 If you have less pertincy you can do a lot more with it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339 Ich fühl mich auf die ...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393 So I can
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0172982_0173031 That's it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434 So you suggest we could better focus on, for example, the docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717 like other functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210 Instead of... ...of lesbians.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671 Do you think the docking station will...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115 is allowed in the budget we have.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504 It's not too...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153 Because I think that's...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456 That's a good advantage point as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363 if we have a warranty looking docking station or... So that's a nice requirement.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0179483_0179580 the installation.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0180046_0180112 I think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259 That's a good boy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868 You said they easily get lost as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939 So maybe we should implement the audio sign or something.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706 So we're going to wear this audio signal. It should be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126 I think it's not too expensive.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279 another
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692 or the LCD screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591 I don't know if that will cost too much.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291 Teu vinho, teu mente.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015 Just the LCD.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170 Just a normal screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190317_0190417 small screen
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679 to some extra info.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060 I think that's a good idea as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584 It's the smallest dream.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580 It's been better than before.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270 I think it should be possible as well.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639 Let's see what did we say.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233 to be fancy design, easy to learn.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469 few buttons, you talked about that
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768 Talking Station LCD
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087 um... general functions
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280 and default materials.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0196452_0197489 I think that's a good idea as well because all the people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688 So, it doesn't really matter.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944 So, thinking problems.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316 Let's specify the target group.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966 Are we talking about elderly people or people from 42 to 80?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687 Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above 60 maybe.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201043_0201135 Eu aguardo o mim, mano.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925 If we want to profilate us, for example, the telephone for elderly people, we can...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252 Target reveal, elderly people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905 So it's still available to you.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535 And you're talking about 16 to 80, for example?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642 en verschillende cultuur.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0205642_0205713 Parade
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008 We hebben 5 minuten geleden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0207008_0207094 and with
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360 in different languages.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085 Or you have to put a language that will be very necessary.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464 It's better to put it on different markets.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880 So that's the target.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323 There are a few small things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808 Okay.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226 We'll put the minutes in the project documents folder.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102 What we are going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432 Because the interface design is using interface concept and trend watching.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0212458_0213492 So just keep in mind things we've said about the target group and the requirements and the trends which we're going along.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955 and the specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385 So, thank you for this meeting.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656 And I think we have an interest right now.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936 It's a good thing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139 Okay
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775 Ja, ik ben ook een kijkje. Dat is een user interface of iets? Ja.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117 for the technical functions of it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658 Um... yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215 I think we must use the general functions remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0059215_0060963 Ik heb nog veel informatie over dit. Ik ben er in het feest.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113 I've been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844 So you've got a lot of devices like D3D, Derevation, Stereo.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948 Dus, eh...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317 but it must be used friendly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041 So you can put a lot of functions in one.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588 In 1 remote.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0064588_0064676 Ale...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479 Um... yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318 Ik heb de meeste functionen in één remote control, maar je kunt zien dat deze remote control een simpel remote control is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014 Veel bedden, maar deze remote control heeft veel bedden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502 So, yeah. People I don't like, it's so...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347 Well, I was thinking about keeping the general functions like a yard.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665 Het is een on-offer button.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974 Keep it like a red burden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596 en iedereen weet het, dus je moet het niet veranderen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183 That personal, our preferences, so...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706 Deze speciaal functies van de verschillende device gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070706_0070792 So, um...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491 What are you thinking about?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217 This is the remote controller. You got the general functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145 Zoals de on-off button, ik weet niet. Hier heb je een soort display.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438 This is a touch screen.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0074438_0075919 Dus je hebt de function van de device voor een DVD-player. Voor een reverse zz.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452 We hebben hier real buttons voor selectie aan de schrijf.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0076586_0078034 Zo, list balance of DVR. Voor every device je kan een apart display of a part buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621 Dus je kan nooit alle betons op één niveau.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045 So, this is my idea about it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323 Um... yeah, and...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809 Yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945 So that's great.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395 En de reale buttons we hebben gehouden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994 We gebruiken de grote bedden.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294 everybody has to use it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664 Wel, of even, of old people, young people.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268 We moeten de betonsen gewoon simpel en groot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577 Merci beaucoup.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0082833_0082896 Yeah
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237 Dat was mijn car.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427 Yeah, I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751 Je hebt een hele zee schrijven.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069 Het is niet een color of iets.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648 Het is gewoon...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683 Ik heb er ook iets aan de internet, niet vandaag, veel gevoel.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961 Because, yeah, quite.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685 Kind of Dutch Green.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287 20 euro, sorry.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515 So, it's possible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0089662_0089761 Yes, really?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395 Deze mensen moeten de deel tekenen voor een subterre.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506 So it's a
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0150585_0150660 for LL.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617 I don't mean for TV
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713 But we can't skip this place so we don't need it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000 Das ist der letzte, was du hast.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0018276_0018355 I think I'll go first.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813 Mein Name ist Frank Schamper.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965 I'm Andy Mark, next room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091 よられるんだ
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426 I've done some research.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302 We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556 We'll let them sell out of questionnaire.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822 We had 100 of these tests done.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220 In addition we did some market research.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526 see what the market consists of.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664 what ages are involved.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460 Well, these are three quite astonishing results I thought.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753 Remote being considered ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963 75% of the
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633 People questioned, indicated that they thought they were a murderer. It was ugly.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285 And an additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733 In addition, remote run up is very functional.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332 50% of the people indicated they only use about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939 And 50% of the people indicated that the remote tends to get lost in their room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028233_0028307 some things.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894 Then we did some research to do most relevant functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664 Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867 The power button color 9.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117 and 10 effects go to the 6th and a half
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222 So these are the most
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700 most important functions of remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927 Then there is some Montreuse Ocean.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087 That's what I'd like to call it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550 There are audio settings, video settings and channel settings buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074 which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702 Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943 168 times per hour.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502 Then these are the, this is the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874 The main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical under remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285 They like to use new functions.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438 But they also are very critical.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637 They won't spend their money very easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423 The users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731 They are not really very interesting features.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997 But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811 Well, I think this indicates where...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336 I think we should make a remote for the future.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480 And this means we will...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984 I have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938 This also makes up most of the big part of the market so that will also be where our main profit will be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342 This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614 The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned, thought that the remote control caused errors high.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217 This is certainly something to take into account.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate new control. We want control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379 So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672 Besides of course the remote must look very nice.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933 functionality
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727 As a lot of people indicated they only use about 10% of the buttons. I think we should make very few buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175 This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670 I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162 especially the channel selection of audio and selection buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539 because they are used most and so they should be robust.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695 They shouldn't break down easily.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851 Then as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, it might be
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678 When I say white be because it would certainly boost the production cost a lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985 But it might be a good idea to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629 En dit zou kunnen een boter kunnen krijgen, waarin we de signal naar de remote zou senden, die dan een beep zou.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890 so you know where it is in the room.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392 And in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0050571_0051711 Then, surprisingly, a great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826 This was...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436 Mostly people in the age of 16 to 25.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805 but up till 45 it remains feasible.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574 This would also greatly increase the production cost, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0053859_0053925 That was real.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0054420_0054490 Crystal.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050 Heerst met de toppingin.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058050_0058150 Switcher
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0058150_0058187 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837 Well, we certainly make a fancy design.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089544_0089606 Let us dream.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819 Yeah, we can do that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796 So is there any discussion possible about any project requirements?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896 Yeah, because you're saying that Telethax is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197 En nieuwe tv's hebben internet access.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863 But I think if you're targeting people of 40+, the chance that they will have a DV with internet access
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278 Within the next like 20 years is very slim.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133 In addition, people indicated that Teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543 So I think it's pretty dumb to put no Dill attacks feature on it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840 I'm pretty much against it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878 Besides that, I think the market for 40 plus is like...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0123983_0124063 Pretty small.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873 But if I say this, I think we're just gonna go for another...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439 saying we cannot enough diff...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0125565_0125638 I think we can do it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298 Yes, but it's not the biggest part of the...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973 Besides that, they're not very critical, so... I mean, they don't really care.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315 What the remote control is like?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688 They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961 I think there will be a case in the...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414 16 to 45 Hs category.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077 Because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605 People are 40 plus. I mean, they want it to work, but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976 As soon as it works, it's okay with them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610 maybe if we make a remix
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275 But obviously the board tends to disagree.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146351_0146443 So...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971 I was thinking I definitely would see a bad idea, not to include it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038 I don't think that's really an issue anymore, cause...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154163_0154263 might be.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858 I mean, it's only for TV, you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329 We need that 1 to 0 button in the next channel, previous channel.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821 up, fullium down and some Taylor-Tex buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360 I think we need to show you again.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508 Thank you very much.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740 I think many people like to use a navy
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506 If you want to switch from channel 1 to like 35 you don't want to push the next channel button 35 times
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525 That is true but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089 I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238 And so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899 The TV would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220 I don't know if many channels...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162420_0162508 Do you have that?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612 Pretty views on that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063 But I don't think if you're gonna make remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497 Heving een paar botten zijn spas voor je.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313 Because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV, which already only have the minimum number of buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540 I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001 That is true but I think there is not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only to operate only the TV.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897 Because if you have a remote control only to operate a TV, there's simply not a lot of buttons required.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553 There's not a lot of functions required, so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184 So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602 En dat kost een... een grote markt.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173040_0173099 which was
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663 one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market the lot.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845 Yeah, I think, I mean, we obviously needed a good way to position all the buttons and...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153 But I don't think we should spend pretty much time in that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428 Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research, too.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733 what other people like to have in them.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039 like that X-training remote control.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443 Yes, well 50% of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188 Yeah, that was my last suggestion.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919 You have it on P-Chain if you want it so it goes. You have some phones too. You have a docking station.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252 and you just press a button in the front, it goes ringing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0184328_0184403 So that way it is.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701 I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn,
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355 And we're focusing on elderly people here, which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928 It might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which will explain a button if you press it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068 which would tell you what it does.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747 And it wouldn't have to be touch screen or very expensive screen but...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469 Just a small screen of it too.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307 ¡Adiós!
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635 I was too into that.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437 I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0201108_0201183 Nothing.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807 I think it would be... if we should do something like that, it would be...
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198 I think it will be really good for the image of the company.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681 And I think there will be good market for it.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211 they were able to really bring an innovative product.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648 Yeah, really?
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196 I have to look into that a little more.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517 and with the little screen in it which explains the buttons.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794 I think it would be a lot easier too.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113 adapted to different cultures.
AMI_TS3003b_SDM_MTD012ME_0214713_0214775 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673 Een muipje van bonersdesign.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321 For the energy source we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829 The kinetic energy, like in a watch, which you just shake and it produces energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360 but if we choose for that option the talking station could become obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601 So I don't think it's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583 For the casing, the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing, single or double curved casing,
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859 And it's really up to the design that we're gonna use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347 Dat is een bepaalde technische restricitie.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153 As a case supplement we could have added a rubber belt like an anti-slip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677 For the book buttons we can use a plastic or rubber.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326 And the chipset, it says simple here but it should be advanced because we're using an LCD here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026 And as the trend watcher presentation shows, people like wood.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725 but it raises price and doesn't really fit the image unless we would start two product lines.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913 4x4, that's not shit, I've got it wrong.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554 Well, the kinetic energy short is rather fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817 But it depends on what we want.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047 I think we should discuss that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706 For the case, the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523 and the chipset really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0091523_0091576 Das ist
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992 Yeah, that's it. There are four options.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273 You can use the basic neural battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436 A hand dynamo.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719 But I don't think that's really an option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113 You don't wanna swing before you can watch television? Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261 de solar cells
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667 but not every room is very light so it's not a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0099667_0099767 or the kinetic energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754 You basically shake your remote and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0101742_0101816 It's true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402 I don't have any informational pricing
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632 Så jeg har haft at have sted i mannefaktioner de brød.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810 Dat zou ook voor de LCD-screen gaan.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165 It's a bit higher percentage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714 And that's the best choice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947 Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100 So it's gotta be advanced.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061 I don't know if you did that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305 I'll have to... I'll have to take a shower.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060 Well, the general, like most older remotes are flat, just straight.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699 En de verkeerde departement kan ook een single curved of double curved kase.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622 It would just only affect the form for a fire sign.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003 So it's really just up to the design department what we're gonna use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236 It doesn't really matter for the price or the function.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537 Big one. Do what I can do.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534 I think we should start by choosing a case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785 Because that's the basis of building them.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445 Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151 Got the slag guys.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358 from the side so it's running normal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993 They're the single perv so they're not really sure what they're gonna do but I think it's something like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632 So this type should be better for you or better should prevent. Better the straight injury a bit.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274 And the dog looks something like this I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600 Look, those are the three options we have.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185 It's more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it's always a ball phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030 Maybe you should just start on a blank page.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425 Sehr gut, als Nimm.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837 This is for the meeting already.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093 I hope you enjoyed your lunch.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346 That is in anyway.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602 Um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309 One, two, three.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844 Okay, this is the second phase we're going to discuss today.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162 Dit is de Conceptual Design Meeting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095 And a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409 ...van de Conceptual Specification of Design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622 and also trend board change.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580 These are hopefully the points you'll address in your presentations. You're going to show me in a few minutes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215 First, I'll show you the agenda.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404 First the opening.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621 There we have three presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142 After that we had to come to a decision on the remote control concert.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383 Are you going to make it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600 And then we're closing.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800 We hebben dat 40 minuten.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221 So, yes, let's get started.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747 Did someone encounter any problems during the operation?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182 That's a fine.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011182_0011256 Tschüss.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177 Then maybe the last thing about the last meeting
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469 These are the points with Grego.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758 new finance and the target market.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0012758_0013769 Our requirements are 10-text docking station, audio signal, small screen, and some extra button information.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987 And we're going to use default materials.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661 Does somebody have any comments on these requirements?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611 These are just things we thought of, so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else, just let me know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755 Maybe you can now work it out.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334 And we're going to target the 60 to 80 year old customers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402 So everybody knows what we're doing. And I suggest let's get started with the presentations.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012 So you keep the same line up as last time.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452 Good luck.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495 S'il te plaît.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736 Any questions? But the trends?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365 Okay, you can finish.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0091739_0091784 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432 So that brings us to the discussion about the concept.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825 So these are the points we have to discuss.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318 Um... first...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021 I think we can talk about the energy source since that's...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908 has a pretty big influence on production price and image.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011 So...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927 I think first of all we have to say it is possible to introduce kinetic energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077 Well, I think it's true. Elderly people just like to have everything in place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773 And I don't think they like remote just being everywhere in their rooms.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157 So maybe a docking station will help them give the room out of place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369 And also what you said.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186 You can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964 but I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441 So you have a button on your docking station that you can push and then it starts beeping.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214 And then we can still use the force recognition, but maybe then for only the channels.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396 I'm learning
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198 It's a great fight.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438 Ja, goedemiddag, vrouw.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477 Good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791 easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961 No, that's the thing, it's a good place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054 I personally think the LCD screen we want to use with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507 It's just some extra information, it's easy to ignore as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757 But if you don't want to use it, you just don't use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889 And yeah, I think maybe we have to discard the voice recognition.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431 because it will increase cost significantly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946 And I don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372 So that brings us back to the energy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126 If you don't have force recognition, it won't use a lot of energy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356 So in that case we could use kinetic energy. But I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466 That much cheaper as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353 Okay, let me just choose for the battery.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484 That brings us to the chip.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847 We're using the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465 Okay, that's first chip
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455 And then we get to the point of the case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119 which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652 If you want to choose for wood or the black and grey
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732 One dollar?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723 As we saw, it's a little more expensive to produce.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033 But I think it will attract other people when I have something exclusive which they can show off to their grandkids.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275 Okay, I've got the new remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399 That's right.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850 But wood color was a lot more expensive.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038 Деда.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515 I think it's really because, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064 It's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896 So, that's the case.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413 In the cell, the case, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794 I think that's a very good option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768 Because they can advertise as well with give your grandfather a new page for his remote control or whatever.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796 Because it's something extra, it's something other remotes don't have. Which we can get a greater advantage.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959 So then you can make him with color
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145 Black and grey, what they call us as well.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770 So you suggest we should design two different telephones?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830 Of je kunt een remote control gebruiken of je kunt gebruiken van verschillende koffers. Nou, ik denk dat het niet zo goed is.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767 So everybody is okay with the changing covers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059 Saying it's a good time, it's option.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555 Change in case, go ahead.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318 But the forum has to be with us too.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677 It has to be possible to stand up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912 or just I need to know just a little bit
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416 And the cover of the docking station is also...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749 On to był w tej telewizji innej.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158749_0158792 Allons !
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180 Then you can click it in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369 That's okay.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722 De interface...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048 What type of interface do we want to use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709 Maybe you can make a little drawing of it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144 on the boy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381 Somebody have ideas for a forum where...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252 Is het een fuse? Ja, is een fuse wel weer... Dat is wel mooi. Het is gekoond.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349 But you have extra buildings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495 So people can get confused.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086 especially if they have the same writings on it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234 Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173340_0173417 the same
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789 functions as the normal one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194 Данья Тайев

AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292 And then you're good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482 There's the... let's use green.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107 What's the thing?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553 Plus, I mean...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069 No, it's not very handy, I think.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520 Because the pleasant mean will be opposite.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813 Not at the same finger.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100 I guess.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349 Maybe it's...yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117 But is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262 I think the functions are...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981 That basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing channels.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589 Z tym z sobą.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961 I think we can just leave the normal shape.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365 But maybe we have to...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783 Nij kan het een beetje meer fancy.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988 in one another way.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404 Like, yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709 I suggest a single curve. Because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514 so that elderly people can use their remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759 because it's a bit of an angle.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0197954_0198030 I think so.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198497_0198586 Good night.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153 Do you have an app side down or? Mm-hmm. Do you have a... Sad... Well, let's do it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581 So get your nose.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961 That's a good move.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386 But I think it's better to put the screen on top.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339 So just flip it 180 degrees around. And the display that's right here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592 If you can have this one and turn it like this.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761 Yemin ediyorum, ne videosu yapacağım?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490 Because maybe your hand is in the way of you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0207860_0207900 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208151_0208188 old
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288 Start on a blank bay. Yeah. Right, then we get...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838 This girl.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509 En hier is het bij de boombutton.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175 and we can add a little bit of hair here maybe
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421 Just that score lesson in my senses.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958 and then the rest of the business here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498 Yes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344 a bit more friendly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0215951_0216031 지금
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423 you
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512 We've got a general idea of the concepts and materials we're going to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081 So now for the next meeting we'll have to look at the look and feel design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575 It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819 Check uit de Korpbe website.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286 The user interface design is the same, sorry.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527 and product evaluation.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198 So the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771 But you're going to get your instructions, I think, send the body coach.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642 So, I will put these minutes in the folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0221860_0223007 And then we're going to try to finish our project and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394 있어라 아..치
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233 I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or... I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361 And then you'll get a message.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778 ¡Salud, salud! ¡Ves quieto!
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026 Nee, niet eens wel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240 I think safety is one of them.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0225592_0225685 Buddhist group
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653 Alright, let's get started.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788 Smart boy, there it is.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235 Het is over daar in de purchase folder.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764 And then I guess we'll start in 30 minutes again.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD009PM_0227926_0228011 Thank you, good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943 Mm-hmm.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820 Um, yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237 There is some research about the designing of the interface.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969 The last meeting earlier about using a few buttons.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534 So that's what I want to...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088 ...toedoe in de oude design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675 Het is een attractief manier om de remote te controleren.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406 Ik heb een paar dingen gevonden over de voetbouwrecognitie.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725 so maybe we can use that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241 and using a little display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263 Just focus on the primary functions.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0052279_0053386 So only a bit for sound, for on-off shifting up channel or down shifting down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794 Let's see.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0054053_0055076 We need some new attractive functions which attract people for using it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904 Ik vind het een speciaal regeling en een speciale boterking voor de selectie van de subtitles.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247 just as we mentioned last meeting.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736 And yeah, overall, you're so friendly.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079 Dus gebruik je grote bitten.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127 Het is mogelijk om een scherpe systeem voor een voedselwakker.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078 Je kunt het denken over als je de remote control vervalt, je kunt het dan proberen en het geest een schik signaal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315 Zo, ja.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0059355_0060394 and for shifting up a channel or for putting out the sound or something
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972 you can just give a sign, say, sound off or...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248 and uh... yeah
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666 Dele The television put the sound off
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0061979_0062017 지
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062017_0062107 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754 Ik dacht over het speciaal beton voor subtijden. Gewoon één beton. Om het te houden van het sample.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187 Op de boter kan je een klein stukje uitdelen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204 Double push, double click, you get the big subtitles for people
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965 of we een klein bedoel kunnen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167 Собо.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977 We moeten in een generelle beddening houden, dus de beddening die we moeten gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608 De onacht, de zand, de onacht, de zand, de huiër, de lower en de namers 0 tot 9.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499 The general button, more one button for shifting down the jam.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0067499_0068547 We willen ook een klein display gebruiken voor de functies van de beddening.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546 We kunnen een function maken waarin we de tv's gaan.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161 So, there are pictures of a
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219 Nie, nie.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824 Just you can put on a button over here in this corner.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571 Ik heb al de remote-controls op de plekken gegeven.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271 En dat is de manier waarop we de manier kunnen zien.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416 C'est bon.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043 Display of het is een smal display.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312 We kunnen het op de top afleggen.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615 ... het is de meest...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199 Plezier people, mocht wel van looks.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041 So, a special button for shifting down a channel.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585 om te lezen dat het allemaal op de...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038 So you can easily shift up or shift down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404 那...這...怪的...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077560_0077623 any place.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316 En andere functies voor een subtitel, een bit en voor zand.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304 En de overal designen moeten we over het verkeer. Dus de vorm van het.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573 And that's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0103973_0104066 What's the function?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374 Yeah, for rounding up the batteries.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0104502_0104541 Bye bye.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864 I won't use much energy I believe.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811 Het is gewoon een klein plek, dus ik denk dat het een batterij van 6 maanden of meer zal rijden.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293 So I believe one battery is just enough.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0107293_0107332 So...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0109111_0109182 Nice.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0122010_0123074 but it's a re-church about large LCDs display or just a small one we want to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359 All of that. I don't know.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497 Is het wel mogelijk om een veranderbare keizel te maken?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0140497_0141783 So you got with mobile phones, like Nokia mobile phones when you can change the case of it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143 Máme poslubitelné.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0142143_0143382 Dus je hebt gewoon om een standard remote controler te maken en je kunt een paar... In dezelfde kaste.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139 We kunnen gewoon de wegbrenger van het verhaal gebruiken, maar het is niet heel fijn.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0162139_0162213 to
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324 for left handed users.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165576_0165671 Yeah, we'll be right back.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715 Het is mogelijk om een programma te maken. Je hebt de schijfpunt aan de linker en de rechtschijfpunt aan de bovenkant.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669 Nu zijn de buitenkantjes voor het schuif.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929 Um...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0168784_0168851 is a fuse.

AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194 Wiesz co, to jest to.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199194_0199283 This is how.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043 Misschien is het een spotbal om deze kant te maken zoals...

AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425 To make this slide, um, that...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850 Cool.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217 bit like so in the form of your hands
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202217_0202304 So,
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202446_0202545 That's...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157 So the remote control has to lay in your hand.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536 So, it's what they have for us.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151 and the buttons for
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620 Dancing at the general over here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644 So I just flew
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150 I will display
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060 I don't know, but...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061 Like on your mobile phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875 Life means...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463 Maar een half beten, stil er niet op.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0002409_0002464 Кашнинг?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300 I'll try not to puke
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995 Okay, I'm done informing you about the trial watching I've done in the past few days.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224 We've done some market research.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610 distributed some more uncapped questionnaires.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0021670_0022728 And besides that I deployed some trunk watchers to Milan and Paris to get all of the newest trends.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525 And I've consulted some additional trend watchers as the original trend watchers returned about what the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088 that's the song you would be.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509 Okay, these are some overall findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960 The most important thing is the fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462 The research indicated that that was by far the most important factor.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239 Inactiveness was about half as important as fancy design.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776 By enoughiveness, this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839 About half of the portent as the innovativeness was easy to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0027839_0029193 For our group, we're focusing on the people of 60, 80 years old. These factors are slightly more equal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830 These are some more group specific findings.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102 All the people prefer dark colors.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533 Ze zijn wel bekend op de schepen en een vergeten materiaal.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093 Deze bezoekers hebben het geïnteresseerd dat er speciaal woed is.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633 the material for all the people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0031633_0032764 This image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that we're about to have.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520 It leads us to some personal preferences.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933 The remote control and the docking station should blend in in the...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226 In the room.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797 Ac mae'n ddweud yw'r ddweud yw'r ddweud.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557 Just keep it simple and well, docking station on a small screen would be your main points of interest.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270 because this would be the, this would be the inactiveness in remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896 So this would be very important that we at least include these features.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0036896_0037901 Well, the trend watchers I consulted advised that it should be remote control and the docking station should be telephone shaped.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470 So you could imagine that remote control would be standing up straight in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085 This is not really, this is pretty much a new shape to polar people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958 So they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170 so it would be kind of more telephone shaped.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0040266_0041314 Besides that we would advise to bring two editions, one with the wood-like color and maybe a few, and one with a great black color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809 The Woodlike for the more exclusive people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998 People with more money.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227 The grey-black color for a rock.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730 Πήγε ο Βρασμίλ.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203 That would be all.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0043635_0043711 of the transit.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370 and how exactly does the kinetic energy work.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100370_0100424 Oh, you just...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747 your remote and then it powers up.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706 Well, personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499 And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267 And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559 Get great popularity for a product.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007 um
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196 Yeah, you could load up batteries, you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720 That was true. Elderly people...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954 I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557 Because in our earlier market research, if you'd allow me to, would you look that board? Go ahead.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235 Nah, it's just so big here.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594 We hebben ook...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369 as if people would pay more for speed recognition and remote control.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827 Like you see here, our target group would not do that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229 So if that would increase the price for which we are selling our remote control
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667 I would greatly advise you not to do it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175 I think it would be better to insert in our other product that is meant for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0118321_0118391 younger people.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924 Well, this is, you know, this is, you know the question, what would you prefer it?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250 So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970 And on top of that the LCD screen would help in making the remote control easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773 And I think the voice recognition function would not make remote control much easier to use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744 Well, this was for like an LCD screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971 So pretty large.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803 Let's control that. I think the most important factor there is the wooden color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136 So it would actually have to be with... Yeah, it was just...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0138485_0138558 Good color.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574 you'll get a greater strength.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670 We would have to carefully design the...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517 Because we would have to make one control which would fit in with a wooden cover and
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798 plastic cover
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153 Yeah, more original one, more standard one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184 Or you could fly the phone.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094 Well, no, I think we should just design one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867 One remote but it would have to be fancy with either a wood cover or the plastic one.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305 So, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151 I heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curve. Yes.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312 Could you explain it a little more?
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954 and look with single curved and double curved mean
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539 So you can pretty much just pick one, do what you want.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0156788_0156823 That's good.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967 No, just to lay down.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229 the cover of the
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889 Well, besides it...
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200 You said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you can
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156 so your thumb would be easly. Well I think that's a very good point because I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause RSI.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342 So I don't think it's great for that.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900 I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355 for left handed users also.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860 Grr.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985 Well, that's it.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721 Yeah, we could do that, but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the ease of use.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0169396_0170527 But if we would make a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides, then we'd certainly yield great options for the design of the remote.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940 Cos yw'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio'r llunio
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0171552_0171617 That is true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0183930_0184002 That's true.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919 I prefer the Cornishly round.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215101_0215191 Que não tem nada.
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0215435_0215516 안녕
AMI_TS3003c_SDM_MTD012ME_0227946_0227988 ピクッ
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318 Well, this one me and Richard came up with
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630 De default spot voor de Yana gebroken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914 The new button just below that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143 Then there's the volume and channel selectors.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651 simple plus minus button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832 We thought of a help button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459 Als je het hangt en je een andere button op de help gaat naar de afstandsscreen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006 Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210 on button for teletext
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412 But we've got subtitles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547 En de company logo.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108 So it's a rather simple prototype.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509 And we'll have to see from testing how the user is taking it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603 Sure, we'll put it at 80K.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857 en que si lo que
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312 Most controls, they've got more buttons than this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651 En die onafbouwt is in necessity.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827 Yeah, I'll drop that one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305 Volume en channel buttons, je raakt ze niet uit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014 The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295 So a good castle that one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198 I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796 Well, come.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107 leave out the number of buttons I guess.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775 which is rather basic already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707 Evet, bu...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0038707_0039817 They're supposed to be equal sized rather with a little logo on it for the volume to try and recognize.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922 So recognition
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860 Sound for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons? No.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160 with a different color than the case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326 So, today, jump out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672 Okay, that's all.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531 And that's, I think, a big cause.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589 If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402 De docking station is niet even in dit schematic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799 No, it's not even taking any breath.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439 We could save money on it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909 but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432 My mother can't even send the Nazimes message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716 The margin is possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859 No, any other remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535 We're getting closer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608 I could just not scroll for a half a second.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915 That's right, you're going to be brought to it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041 If you want to use an LCD screen you need an external stick.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942 If you could just leave out one more button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0104845_0104933 到明天
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706 Deze is niet met ons dwijf. Wat als je de 388 moet schroeven?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015 888.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125 He could wake the two buttons out of there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299 and just...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820 If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160 zodat we twee botten zetten.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291 if you do the same for the channel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0125541_0125614 More obvious.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0127499_0127588 So if we just run...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190 If we leave our daughter's buttons perhaps we can go with the flat case.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350 and make it smaller overall.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493 So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right under that, then the scroll button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801 you'll get a much smaller remote
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0131028_0131056 Thanks.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171 Richard argument all these changes are
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0173211_0173289 the O5.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147 Yeah, I'm sorry, good one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014 I think that's a free.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412 I still, I think it's, I think, too fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585 to give the issue
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806 Is this like after this every time?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0199991_0200038 That's true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434 Yeah, there wasn't a room with the finance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0207148_0207215 Yeah, this was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687 The tasks are very strict so you can just do step by step. Very easy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414 The smart board, the drawing is just a pain in the ass.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773 This took place very much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110 flip over or smooth, precise
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0214261_0214361 I was doing this well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0217626_0217690 I
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023 considering we're not going to make a docking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0002698_0002756 Have a good one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551 To jest to swój... ...estrany dę.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665 Starts at 3 o'clock.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211 Bien, on va essayer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450 are put in the nose leading.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0004774_0004870 There he is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801 Okay, this is our last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236 In this meeting we will discuss our final design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073 En we gaan er wat evaluatie over de producten die we nodig hebben. Maar ook in het project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473 And there we are going to move close to project today as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027 So after this you'll be free to go and resend your money.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951 Dit is een kleine designmediaal. We hebben de vloer over de design gevoeld.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616 De reproductie in de verkeerde design en we doen de productevalation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053 In order to do that, we have this agenda.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431 We will have the prototype presentation first.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847 Then we'll set up some elevation card pan criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128 Then we will look at the finance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851 We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264 Because everything costs money and the more friction you want to have, the more money it will cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897 So we'll see if it fits within the 12.5 Euro per remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106 We will see that later.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608 Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797 We've got 40 minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313 So we will be finished at half past three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458 But first...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059 People do the... this is probably the dark presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536 to some other asmrs and so forth.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033 But I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to give it the simple
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364 just a few buttons and large buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914 But I think these are all together. Quite a few buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558 I'm wondering if we really need all of those with us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0030283_0030338 Bitch.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0034073_0034143 Bye, friends.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567 De extinte titels.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300 So I had somebody about something about the design of the buttons there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660 Mooi mocht er in worden.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042770_0042859 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583 The customer is very very nervous. I will move on to the finance part.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103 which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we want to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313 And I gotta tell you...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184 It's going to be a pretty hard time producing this for 7.5 Euros.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093 If we see, I don't know if I feel incorrect, so just correct me if you see something wrong.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275 I counted two batteries.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449 Maar misschien kunnen we ook ook zo gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571 Elle en a, sensibilité.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046688_0046778 between show and live.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0046778_0046829 Yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569 It's two euros up.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771 We need the atmosphere.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964 Wcale jedna świeca...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445 Just save there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674 Maybe we have to sing with girls?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330 We kunnen zien dat de verschil tussen een curve en een singel curve is wel een euro.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0049567_0050630 I don't know but I think the single curve is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771 I think we have to keep that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207 Then we have the case material supplements.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051207_0051288 It's plastic?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551 C'est chez le bousin qui est né.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892 Dus dat is de helptuur, de helptuur is ook veilig.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253 But then the biggest cause are the buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124 So maybe you should try to discard some buttons to keep our calls though.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846 Because we have to get the 12 and a half Euros at the end.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498 So, let's first count the buttons we have now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741 God is in heaven for sixty.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171 Dat wil niet zien hoe mooi het is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282 Nathan, you're us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363 Okay, including the health.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577 На север.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973 I think we can discard the help and the mute button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577 by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157 That saves us one year already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347 Os da minha caldo-fercinho, ou o que?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0058911_0059003 This is...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638 Ja, dat is al wel... Ja, dank je.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761 Ja, maar dat is niet verstaat in dit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582 So maybe we can even make one by then with the volume on the channel in one by pressing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189 Essa possibilidade, já.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747 So, and it's good for the design as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063747_0063844 so you can make.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253 But...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373 Actually like this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283 Please sit right there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604 Cross
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938 Yeah, so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0067938_0067994 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755 I think they can do the material.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434 On the chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069640_0069710 Uh...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069710_0069759 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476 But I think because we have the old phones chip, I can just count this as one bit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612 But now that I'm...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110 Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to open half Euros.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807 Also the LC display. I think it's too expensive for the display we use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166 I think they tried
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535 That's right, but what's the biggest advantage of our remote band?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858 Take it in a good breath.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075858_0075946 That's the extra.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0075946_0075992 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577 That's the option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108 고생하셨습니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625 Don't you think we can... definitely can... guard this as one button?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335 and integrate these buttons in three. Then save a lot of money as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0079648_0079729 It's cool.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216 Yeah, but we have to stick to the 12 and all of you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758 We don't have any more budget to the more difficult goal.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085451_0085521 Tails.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913 If you read all this on series today.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188 And if you use less plethora?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그.. 그..
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445 There it is. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876 Ik ben er zo...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0088391_0088466 Thank you very much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850 I think it's difficult as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606 Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programmers.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091774_0091815 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155 Because there's not, we save 10 deadlines.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604 So yeah, five, four, three, two, one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082 So we've got the rest of the stones.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674 We're getting closer. Good luck.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454 감사합니다.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956 Or maybe you can...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416 scroll
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856 If you scroll you will see the number on the LCD display.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061 You tell your brother I remember, then you push it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800 It's a long push button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289 Okay, but then you know, we can push some other breathing machine.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097773_0097811 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288 Je moet een half seconde in het schroren.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412 Ja, aber es wird definitiv Krokost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634 and feeling better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440 And the regular check is not possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541 Hasn't it, at least?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028 ...nie idę na czterech szczypach.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674 And we can save a euro by a flat design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510 That's an option you're getting. Yep. I know. Then we're almost there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103221_0103313 Så er vi.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097 Ja, maar ik denk dat dat een grote film is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780 Can we integrate the data text and the subtitles in one button?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181 I think it's pretty much...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035 That could be
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0110185_0111458 I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guy, you can explain to the people how they use the scroll wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738 Just make it real simple.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275 The person saves. Saves a lot of money.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622 and we can keep our LCD screen which can provide extra information.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798 and how to use the school wheel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097 I'll see you guys in the next video with Bitlence S subtitles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870 En dit is goed voor de inhoogteff design, dus wel!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054 Keep with your eyes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936 And...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970 Ik ben al heel erg benieuwd.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0118202_0118283 Please.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389 Something like that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627 And... yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119627_0119725 Get this going on.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301 One, two, three, four, five, that is, if we raise this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659 E a gente toda a sensão.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704 That's really a good idea.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742 And that will make the users of the scroll wheel more obvious. More obvious indeed.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440 So like one and four you move the channel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540 So if you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127540_0127616 Peace man.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873 So we got one, two, three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246 Yeah, we can leave the lyrics in if we want.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484 That's my job today.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0129528_0129580 So if you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130183_0130236 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0130848_0130903 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131141_0131200 sleep
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599 You can praise this one too.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0132777_0132865 There you are on the edge.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891 It's more the molds in which they are being made, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149 Single grunt is pretty easy, just fill it in.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440 En dan komen de cases uit het machine.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932 e tenho curtir acerto e vai me mexer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349 I think this is a really easy one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204 What does everybody think about a flap or a single curved t-zone?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368 Frès.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976 Yes, it does come. I just have to.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138075_0138134 There are a lot of...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138448_0138544 Graças a Deus!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061 We'll do some research
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867 But I think we can keep the single curve long.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423 Just to express our LCD screen a bit more. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234 Some people might use it more, especially for the health functions. It will be good if we have scroll bar, scroll weapon.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583 We will be necessary for the other group of help, in the future as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553 치고
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030 I think it was better to have this process a bit dirty.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412 Ik heb het wel eens onthrijven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852 I'm glad we could make it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487 That's pretty different. It's pretty different. This one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0146301_0146358 Together
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692 So we're gonna
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0147824_0147921 Thank you the most.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713 Chasing en zo.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057 We can let you be it's a... We can stick it out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480 Go. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709 Maybe that's recognizable for them as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882 스크류
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380 So I'm just very busy in the morning.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789 And it's less frightening I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461 If there's seriously something to think of, there will be five buildings.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0151710_0151804 Take it like what?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752 I would like.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952 That's it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182 I would buy them houses.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385 Nelerin?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583 Bye guys, and until then I'll be right back.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939 Yes, they are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590 but we can go on with the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070 Grazie.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185 Okay, sit down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519 We still have 15 minutes left, so we'll be nice and schedule.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017 Umm... The project process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654 The valuation of the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156654_0156703 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972 And it was thingy at the point I forgot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157073_0157148 Shit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416 There it is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698 Thank you!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938 Good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406 Ik heb al 5 minuten gezien. Dat is natuurlijk een pakke waardel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595 No, we've got 15 minutes left.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0159654_0159733 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0160899_0160939 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947 Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409 I tried to but it's giving average but the other thing is softer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151 I think it's fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912 You said that I don't know about this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763 So we've got 20 cents for our booking station.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172007_0172054 지
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577 That's a bit...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279 I would say four, you know, five.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431 405, Tor.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0173431_0173528 Good to be here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0174139_0174236 as it's functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410 I think it's seven.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373 It was.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514 I have been worked out.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276 They're okay, they're very functional and getting lost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496 I think with a new radio button, I think it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0180601_0180679 I think it's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0181167_0181228 See you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495 That would give us four.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543 then we also do it in three.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656 쭈욱
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737 Yes, yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657 and they want to put fashion in their products.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820 in de slogan van de company.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250 We hebben de removable vondkasten.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526 So I think it's very recognizable.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302 We've got a camera here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159 We've got to go and celebrate.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159 No, you can't do it. Pretty nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0191694_0191750 What do you want?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723 I'm an 80%
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0192723_0192769 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734 That's 84%.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531 I think that's a pretty nice score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196264_0196309 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091 that brings us to the project evaluation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969 Project process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284 Did we move through the right places, you think?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0198284_0198384 long process.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199215_0199260 That's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792 So lack of information, but prices.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462 What's the room for creativity?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171 Because of the finance sheet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519 It's real mess.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092 Internet access.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292 Was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819 Did it work out?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206819_0206916 working together.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281 Also, to view with the... Yeah, it was okay. ...dark space.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665 were the main sufficient for the tasks that we had to do.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854 or really too much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210536_0210617 Why didn't they?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227 Als het woonstel download is, dan weet je dat.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923 ლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლლ
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719 smart boys those who are dating
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663 So you rather wanted to have a flip over.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862 or something that
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403 Fast as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0214952_0215006 Go.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117 You need the smart port application I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463 Ik heb er echt een beeld van.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606 That should be equal to...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760 Yeah, you can ask for this image.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036 Yes, it must be.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673 So sharing of information was okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973 Ja się tu...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141 Yeah, I've been here on the day.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0221553_0221616 It's possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160 It's nice.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383 We found new IDs for
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719 Having this kind of meetings?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853 So everybody puts their own score.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438 Yeah, it mediates the score and you can get one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629 That's better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773 So it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0226902_0226980 Very cool.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875 Any more ideas?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035 questions about the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187 to our birth products.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027 It goes, I think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842 Let me just be... Forget to wear a lost shirt.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225 Articles, meaning the Beijing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759 considering we're
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184 Até a próxima!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323 뭐야?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942 That may be because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little higher.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459 And I think you can composite that as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053 So I think that she will be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536 We think we're gonna get the $12.5 million.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728 Oh, that's it. 50.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002 ¡Pues sí, por sí, mi amor!
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226 Nothing to build.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421 We're going to exploit this product.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631 Ciao !
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796 Michigan, America.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996 People are really thick and thin.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923 Do any more for the younger people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789 Just put it on the mark for everybody.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421 You can change the markets by changing the front cover.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648 That's one thing you can change it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492 Je kunt ook zo vrouwen doen, hoe je het ziet op de mensen bij. Hoe je een fensie kan verzoeken onder de markt.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596 Just as a test.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780 See you, all you birds.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960 That's I think a good philosophy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889 Well then I think we can have a little celebration.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243008_0243104 It's party part
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641 I think we still have to put in more... Okay, so she made it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243641_0243727 Merci.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243727_0243778 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907 I didn't get a message.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644 From the ending of the album, if you are a hip-hop fan.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766 Five more minutes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0244766_0244857 It's good.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441 then we still have some questions.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777 If somebody has any questions, they can ask them now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188 You can put this in the project folder as well.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0246188_0246256 Hmm?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137 Next one is... Picture I think?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996 Dit is een ander.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380 So, what do you think?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0251380_0251450 Taylor.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252084_0252182 right
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373 Yeah, I was really, really mad at the end of the song, yeah. That's okay.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073 Ik denk dat ik nu gaan maken met de presentatie.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994 I will be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292 summary of the project.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455 I think you will get the question in your room.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867 And then I'll meet you in... 10 minutes. Okay?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0257911_0257969 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676 Hopefully my panel down there is software.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD009PM_0258798_0258869 Perfect.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520 Dat is gewoon de normaal remote controles.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092 You push it, you came in page 100.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492 You can use the normal 120 buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251 but you can also use the bed on it for changing the channel
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597 So the shifting better?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145 for shifting up in the text and shifting down.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0028020_0028081 네.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0032664_0032723 I'm sorry, man.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076 or you can build in when you press one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258 record yeah
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430 We just discussed that already.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841 but we think all people don't know that option.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336 So they just put in, of course, a little better.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0036106_0036142 Huh?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0038595_0038650 A bientôt !
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039621_0039712 Try it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870 Just recognizing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252 and we don't need a letter or...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216 We maken er ook wat voor te doen, maar we gebruiken het kleine display en niet het te gebruiken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353 Yeah, so
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989 Ja, we kunnen hier dus.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640 God is in our room, sir.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055647_0055737 15th.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074 Yeah, we'd help it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059797_0059890 I think they're too bad.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170 It's just one better
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336 But...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809 So, two for one big bell.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278 but they are more expensive than the small ones.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447 자, 이제 다야
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922 So maybe you prefer it?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814 But I don't know if it's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508 So, we still got four buttons, but just...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393 Ik had net hetzelfde aan de chip.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825 If you've got skill for that's right.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0070187_0070270 Yeah, but we can just
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323 We can buy a remote control when you can use it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080323_0080403 So, um...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0080795_0081905 We missed the stage below the 12.15. Can't go up.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675 is tot tot omhoog.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308 Maar het is mogelijk om een van de 1250 te maken.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0085405_0085486 I don't think so.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769 But I can't see you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698 Do you want to make a...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326 Ik ben zo fentje en goed.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709 I'm a bit... waiting for that there with the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083 attractieve optie
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571 En zo, u kunt blijven bloren, 12.50 uur.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862 Let's go with this one.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0091964_0092017 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725 Да, это фитнес.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0102171_0102209 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643 Ja, over je hebt toe skip de sub-titel, eh, button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896 I think that's...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203 Yeah, it's big conscious.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445 But, um...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0104854_0104924 啊 平静啊
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420 We'll have you push the stairs a bit.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106593_0106649 to switch.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180 I could be a few.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0130811_0130845 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737 Maar je kunt een grote remantie controleren voor hetzelfde prijs als een kleinste.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154 You only have to pay for the bubble curved or single curved
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380 Ja, zu bitte.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0144166_0144215 ねっ
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881 Good luck.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245 Maar we weten de scrollbuttons van old radios.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690 ook botten zoals dat voor een veranderd en
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848 So we can maybe it's a
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341 That's very special, so...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0169428_0169515 You will go and say
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172293_0172354 Damn it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113 뭐..
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379 405.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0174813_0174866 You see?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045 Exactly.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054 That's a free.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961 We have to test it smooth.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151 네, true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0183216_0183313 I got the tree.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0184600_0184659 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0198655_0198706 ...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034 ever.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998 But if you want to share when you make a picture like this on the presentation.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302 It's easier to share it with other people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688 Dus je kunt het ervoor zetten en het doen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321 or in shared folder or shared directory.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617 I'm not a job partner
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571 Het zou wel een beetje een verkeerde bezoek zijn.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894 Да...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348 你呢
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0221557_0221619 possible.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0222830_0223899 Yeah maybe, just give the numbers of...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0224017_0225098 Het is makkelijk om dingen te doen zoals dat op het computer.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564 So just like, like, to university.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0232341_0232375 Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0243410_0243496 Go see Jimmy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498 Ablifio...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875 Ah, misschien wil jij het wel zeggen.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0252875_0252954 So...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986 Yeah, maybe you have to fill another question.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD011UID_0256986_0257044 It's your earth.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471 That's me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765 Sorry I'm a little late. I'll go on now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891 Good suck on the traffic.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337 Um, hmm. Is this the moment where we ask, where can I ask questions about functionality?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526 When you're in teletext, there are usually buttons where you just press it and go to the next teletext page.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009 Thanks, son.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127 That's what I pointed out earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580 You just make a control for just the TV. There's just not much to gain.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624 sensibly chargeable.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604 What?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058664_0058737 Isso.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435 I assume you count the following channel things for two buttons each, right?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016 I think I think there are two buzzards.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891 Well, I was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402 Don't cut the cost.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849 I think this review is for buttontonium
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689 on the docking station of this.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247 then we should move to a different spot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213 Ναι, ας σου να μου. Μα η μορακά.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340 Well, since the market research...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439 Indicated that other people spend their money easier, more easily, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715 Especially since we have those nice features.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761 if you enjoyed the Sanctioli's play.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089659_0089691 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0089831_0090913 Basically, you become a choice between either a good remote and higher production costs or just any other remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017 But how would a school be able to work here?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447 That would bring up the price of the school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836 I agree. The school loan push button.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0096836_0096923 Good end.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523 I think that would be like the end of her usability.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0099189_0099267 じゃあ、また
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892 I think it's pretty much... The telotex subtitles are... Right now you just push the telotex button, go to page 888, and the telotex disappears.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058 but sometimes they'll stay there.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387 Dus het is een beetje een zwart.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498 Ik kan niet meer...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376 But then again, there will be just pretty much an option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108535_0108604 Holding it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349 remote which they expect to have like 10 buttons for the numbers 1 to 0.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761 There's only five buttons on it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0109976_0110054 And it's cool, yeah?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143 It's a pretty big school.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621 So this is my theory.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884 We know you forgot.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803 Well, I still think we should go for the single-curve design.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008 W imieniu.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451 All these changes are not really... okay with me.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601 but since
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0137769_0137865 I'll just have to
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255 I don't know, just go to the board and...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782 Get us a spiff, 18 dollars a remote.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228 We're going to do some research and see what the options are.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362 It's pretty tough from the start.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959 This is not really like for the group you were making.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152 This will really require a lot of marketing
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482 I'll get this to sell.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297 Because older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426 This is my familiar phone.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830 So we're gonna have to do a lot of convincing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151389_0151436 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580 It might be confusing too.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151720_0151805 Think you like what?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906 Only five buttons.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944 But you're not 60.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394 So, I like set up all these criteria.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642 Evaluation of the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736 Thank you. You're fine.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339 Πάγκουμε το μπιλίξ.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865 Okay, so I did some literature study, analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347 translated into a criteria which would be these
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584 This remote is fancy.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756 De shape-looking feel.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137 What new functions are there?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162137_0162232 Easy to use.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741 The learnability is a very important factor here.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952 This is functional.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317 Are there not too many functions and a number of functions?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740 and those functions are already useful.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0163740_0163825 And the cost?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164080_0164162 The target group?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617 This is the remote really for the Cooper we're making it for.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998 and great profitability.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536 If our company is, if it's easily recognizable, their company made it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081 So we're supposed to be evaluating it right now.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166423_0166471 しっ
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260 Oh, I have to say, this was a little hard because the men saw her last meeting.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0167371_0167425 네, 오케이.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001 It's a design fancy on a scale of 1 to 7.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635 There we go, in San Francisco.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392 Ik ben zo in je neubituur.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929 Ik denk wel dat hij die 7-idols in de goede buttons niet heeft.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030 Should we do them? Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181 Is the design easy to use?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0172780_0172879 Would be for us.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0173579_0173666 Couple of more tips.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438 C'est visant une fois que je suis mort.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714 Do we have all functions that we want to include?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174849_0174943 You think we do?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151 Do we have too many flashlights? No.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175151_0175235 Да, ты чё?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175235_0175320 That's pretty sweet.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990 Oh, and do we?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676 Take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833 like it getting lost and...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301 Maybe we should have it before the good one. This is? It was.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0177301_0177351 Thank you.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770 Production costs within a pre-sendance.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0178770_0178849 Go live again.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698 This is a fit group of focus.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180138_0180230 I think with the new...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0180815_0180879 It's a real
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181091_0181152 Think.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034 I think the radio is not exactly what older people expect of remote control.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0182989_0183036 I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172 I think I'd go for a G.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632 Is kach wie kapuur uit de last van?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738 Yes.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139 you
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762 Hij was al zo spust en calculeerde scoren.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353 We've got the camera.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785 Is this like after this or we done?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100 We go on to it.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189254_0189335 Why, huh?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567 These are sub-effectorists on the sadness for the...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356 ونحن نسوأ
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964 Streams.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191089_0191157 I'm not sure.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499 for maybe minus 8.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834 41
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134 I guess I'll just type the name.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171 certain be able.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145 I think we should have had the finance thingy a little earlier.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442 in de design phase.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0201763_0201840 Not too much.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202278_0202335 Nie czu...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157 And I would have liked to go for that.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420 Younger users also.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833 and just be able to access Internet and...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0204002_0204098 Get something of your own.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573 I tried to open the file on my laptop but...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0217671_0217762 Could not believe
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219000_0219096 He's done nothing.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0219812_0219863 等下
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0232490_0232532 There.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767 Qu'est-ce que tu... Qu'est-ce que tu...
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237264_0237626 Yeah, I still don't think. I mean, if we're gonna make a scroll button anyway.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244 You can be more for the younger people and for the older people. Yeah.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405 So maybe we should just refocus.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004 or specifically for your chain.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0239502_0239563 That's true.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758 Yeah, I think then it would be way more popular with him or people like this. Then it would be with
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0241921_0241996 full of people.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325 Even if it were there, it covers.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121 It's party party.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0244479_0244521 Yeah, you did.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0253017_0253106 That's very wonderful.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515 I know you're supposed to like... I don't know.
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688 Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again?
AMI_TS3003d_SDM_MTD012ME_0259069_0259156 I love the noise.
